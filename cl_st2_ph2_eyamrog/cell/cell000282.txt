Title: Colorectal Cancer Cells Enter a Diapause-like DTP State to Survive Chemotherapy


Abstract: Summary

Cancer cells enter a reversible drug-tolerant persister (DTP) state to evade death from chemotherapy and targeted agents. It is increasingly appreciated that DTPs are important drivers of therapy failure and tumor relapse. We combined cellular barcoding and mathematical modeling in patient-derived colorectal cancer models to identify and characterize DTPs in response to chemotherapy. Barcode analysis revealed no loss of clonal complexity of tumors that entered the DTP state and recurred following treatment cessation. Our data fit a mathematical model where all cancer cells, and not a small subpopulation, possess an equipotent capacity to become DTPs. Mechanistically, we determined that DTPs display remarkable transcriptional and functional similarities to diapause, a reversible state of suspended embryonic development triggered by unfavorable environmental conditions. Our study provides insight into how cancer cells use a developmentally conserved mechanism to drive the DTP state, pointing to novel therapeutic opportunities to target DTPs.

Section: Introduction

There is increasing evidence that non-genetic processes drive drug tolerance, presenting a major hurdle to successful cancer therapy ( Recasens and Munoz, 2019 62. Recasens, A. ∙ Munoz, L. Targeting Cancer Cell Dormancy Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2019; 40 :128-141 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (201) PubMed Google Scholar ). Drug-tolerant persister (DTP) cells are emerging as key players in the field of non-genetic heterogeneity of tumors and have been identified across a wide range of tumors in response to chemotherapy and targeted agents ( Guler et al., 2017 28.

Therefore, DTPs represent a potential therapeutic opportunity prior to development of classic irreversible genetic mutation-driven drug resistance. The DTP state is characterized by cancer cells that are quiescent or slow-cycling and typically represent a small subpopulation of the parental tumor (0.3%–5%) ( Guler et al., 2017 28.

A chromatin-mediated reversible drug-tolerant state in cancer cell subpopulations Cell. 2010; 141 :69-80 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1900) PubMed Google Scholar ). The concept of persisters is derived from the microbial literature, where it is well established that treatment of infections with antibiotics can reduce bacterial burden but, in some instances, fails to eliminate refractory bacteria ( Kaldalu and Tenson, 2019 39. Kaldalu, N. ∙ Tenson, T. Slow growth causes bacterial persistence Sci. Signal. 2019; 12 :eaay1167 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ; Van den Bergh et al., 2017 74.

Rev. 2017; 41 :219-251 Crossref Scopus (242) PubMed Google Scholar ). Bacterial persisters are characterized as phenotypic variants that can transiently tolerate extraordinary levels of antibiotics but remain genetically drug sensitive ( Balaban et al., 2004 1.

In the context of cancer, DTPs represent a reversible state where, upon removal of treatment, often referred to as a drug holiday, they resume growth and proliferation but remain sensitive to chemotherapy ( Recasens and Munoz, 2019 62. Recasens, A. ∙ Munoz, L. Targeting Cancer Cell Dormancy Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2019; 40 :128-141 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (201) PubMed Google Scholar ). Similar to bacterial persisters, the ability of DTPs to escape the toxic effects of chemotherapy cannot be explained on the basis of genetic mutations ( Recasens and Munoz, 2019 62. Recasens, A. ∙ Munoz, L. Targeting Cancer Cell Dormancy Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2019; 40 :128-141 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (201) PubMed Google Scholar ). Pioneering studies by Sharma et al. (2010) 70. Sharma, S.V. ∙ Lee, D.Y. ∙ Li, B. ... A chromatin-mediated reversible drug-tolerant state in cancer cell subpopulations Cell. 2010; 141 :69-80 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1900) PubMed Google Scholar identified DTPs in cancer cell lines and demonstrated that this drug-tolerant subpopulation could be ablated selectively in vitro by treatment with an insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) inhibitor or chromatin-modifying agents. Other studies have also demonstrated a role for repression of stress-induced long interspersed repeat element 1 (LINE-1) expression in driving the DTP state, as well as DTP dependency on the lipid hydroperoxidase GPX4 ( Guler et al., 2017 28. Guler, G.D. ∙ Tindell, C.A. ∙ Pitti, R. ... Repression of Stress-Induced LINE-1 Expression Protects Cancer Cell Subpopulations from Lethal Drug Exposure Cancer Cell. 2017; 32 :221-237.e13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (149) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hangauer et al., 2017 31. Hangauer, M.J. ∙ Viswanathan, V.S. ∙ Ryan, M.J. ... Drug-tolerant persister cancer cells are vulnerable to GPX4 inhibition Nature. 2017; 551 :247-250 Crossref Scopus (959) PubMed Google Scholar ). To date, the majority of DTP studies have focused on in vitro -generated DTPs from commercial cell lines, demonstrating that they exist as a small subset of the total tumor cell population ( Egan et al., 2015 20. Egan, D.F. ∙ Chun, M.G. ∙ Vamos, M. ... Small Molecule Inhibition of the Autophagy Kinase ULK1 and Identification of ULK1 Substrates Mol. Cell. 2015; 59 :285-297 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (521) PubMed Google Scholar ; Guler et al., 2017 28. Guler, G.D. ∙ Tindell, C.A. ∙ Pitti, R. ... Repression of Stress-Induced LINE-1 Expression Protects Cancer Cell Subpopulations from Lethal Drug Exposure Cancer Cell. 2017; 32 :221-237.e13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (149) PubMed Google Scholar ). More recent work in triple-negative breast cancer, using patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), also revealed that only a subpopulation of cancer cells was capable of repopulating the tumor following a DTP state ( Echeverria et al., 2019 19. Echeverria, G.V. ∙ Ge, Z. ∙ Seth, S. ... Resistance to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in triple-negative breast cancer mediated by a reversible drug-tolerant state Sci. Transl. Med. 2019; 11 :eaav0936 Crossref Scopus (178) PubMed Google Scholar ). Interestingly, tumor regrowth was not associated with any genomic selection; therefore, it was suggested that phenotypic properties may have endowed a subpopulation of cancer cells with the capacity to preferentially re-populate the tumor. However, much remains to be understood about the subset of cancer cells that can generate DTPs and the key mechanisms driving the DTP state in vivo .
Given that DTPs represent a non-genetic reversible state cancer cells enter to survive the harsh environment created by chemotherapy,we questioned whether tumors are hijacking an evolutionarily conserved survival strategy. There are limited numbers of conserved survival strategies organisms employ to survive hostile environments, and most are conserved across the animal kingdom, including torpor, estivation, and diapause. Torpor and estivation are typically activated for an animal to survive environments of extreme cold and heat, respectively. Diapause is defined as a reversible state of suspended embryonic development triggered by unfavorable environmental conditions, including nutrient deprivation ( Deng et al., 2018 15. Deng, L. ∙ Li, C. ∙ Chen, L. ... Research advances on embryonic diapause in mammals Anim. Reprod. Sci. 2018; 198 :1-10 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ; Fenelon and Renfree, 2018 23. Fenelon, J.C. ∙ Renfree, M.B. The history of the discovery of embryonic diapause in mammals Biol. Reprod. 2018; 99 :242-251 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ). Diapause is a physiological reproductive strategy utilized across the animal kingdom, including in some mammals, to survive stressful environments. There is no cellular selection in diapause; rather, every cell in the embryo reversibly enters the state, and when the environmental insult resolves, the embryo resumes normal development. We investigated whether cancer cells, and more specifically DTPs, enter an embryonic diapause-like state to survive the stressful environment created by chemotherapy.
Here we used colorectal cancer (CRC) patient-derived models, high-complexity lentiviral barcoding, next-generation sequencing (NGS), and mathematical modeling to identify drivers of the DTP state. We found that xenograft tumors that emerged following a chemotherapy-induced DTP state did not exhibit any significant decrease in genetic or barcode complexity. Furthermore, mathematical modeling supported the “equipotent” model, in which all cancer cells in a given tumor have an equal capacity to enter the DTP state to survive therapy. Indeed, transcriptional profiling revealed that tumor cells adopt a state similar to the diapause state in embryos to survive the stress of chemotherapy and, similar to the embryo, can exit this state and reestablish the tumor upon stress removal ( Deng et al., 2018 15.

Section: Results

To study DTPs in vivo , we established a robust model that generates DTP-state tumors. First, we determined the effect of treatment with standard-of-care chemotherapy on xenograft tumor growth using two patient-derived CRC samples in immunodeficient mice (non-obese diabetic [NOD]/severe combined immunodeficiency [SCID]) ( Table S1 ; Figures 1 A and S1 A). When tumors reached ∼100 mm 3 , mice were treated with standard-of-care chemotherapy regimens for CRC, using maximum tolerated doses ( Figures S1 B and S1C) ( Gustavsson et al., 2015 29. Gustavsson, B. ∙ Carlsson, G. ∙ Machover, D. ... A review of the evolution of systemic chemotherapy in the management of colorectal cancer Clin. Colorectal Cancer. 2015; 14 :1-10 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (401) PubMed Google Scholar ). For the patient-derived CRC model POP66, tumors from mice treated with 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin (5-FU/LV), oxaliplatin (OXA), or FOLFOX (5-FU/LV and OXA) demonstrated a small but not statistically significant growth delay compared with the vehicle control (saline; Figures S1 D and S1E). Similarly, for CRC model CSC28, there was no significant tumor growth delay of OXA- and FOLFOX-treated tumors compared with saline, although 5-FU/LV-treated tumors had a small but significant growth delay ( Figures S1 F and S1G). There was no difference in Ki-67 expression in all treatment groups for POP66; however, CSC28 demonstrated a significant decrease in Ki-67 expression in the 5-FU/LV- and FOLFOX-treated groups ( Figures S1 H and S1I). No significant differences in TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling) positivity or necrosis were observed across all tumor groups for both models ( Figures S1 H and S1J). The response to 5-FU/LV, OXA, or FOLFOX treatment, which ranged from minimal to no delay in tumor growth, was likely due to dose limitations of the NOD/SCID mice used in these studies.
In contrast, tumors (POP66 and CSC28) from mice treated with irinotecan (CPT-11) or FOLFIRI (5-FU/LV and CPT-11) for 8 weeks demonstrated negligible growth compared with the vehicle controls (saline for 5-FU/LV and 5% DMSO for CPT-11; Figures 1 B–1E). Tumors remained stable for the 8 weeks during which mice were on treatment. However, for both CRC samples, tumor regrowth initiated when treatment with CPT-11 or FOLFIRI was discontinued (between 31–44 days for POP66 and 34–57 days for CSC28; Figures 1 B and 1D). The median time for tumors to reach 400 mm 3 was delayed significantly in the CPT-11 and FOLFIRI groups compared with vehicle controls or 5-FU/LV treatment alone ( Figures 1 C and 1E). There were no significant differences in Ki-67 expression, TUNEL positivity, or percent necrosis between vehicle controls, CPT-11, and FOLFIRI regrowth tumors ( Figures 1 F and 1G). However, tumors that were harvested while on treatment with CPT-11 demonstrated significantly less Ki-67 expression with no significant alterations in percent necrosis or apoptosis, indicating decreased proliferation ( Figures 1 F and 1G). To determine whether CRC cells treated with CPT-11 or FOLFIRI remained sensitive following treatment cessation and tumor regrowth, we harvested viable tumor cells from the regrowth tumors and injected them into new mice, which were subsequently treated with CPT-11 ( Figure 1 H). All tumors remained sensitive to CPT-11 upon re-exposure and again demonstrated no growth while on treatment. Thus, the tumor response to CPT-11 and FOLFIRI was consistent with the cancer cells entering a reversible DTP state. In addition, limiting dilution assays on control (DMSO) versus CPT-11-DTP-state tumors showed no enrichment of stem cells in the DTP state (data not shown), establishing that it is not stem cells that preferentially survive this state.
To generate tumors that were irreversibly resistant to CPT-11 treatment, we continued long-term in vivo exposure in a subset of mice from both CRC samples ( Figure S2 A). The CPT-11 dose was well tolerated by mice over the entire course of treatment ( Figures S2 B and S2C). For POP66, continuous long-term treatment in vivo resulted in three CPT-11-resistant tumors (of 10 total) that grew on treatment (∼214 days; Figures S2 D and S2E). Interestingly, despite being on treatment for ∼15 months (469 days), resistant tumors never developed for CSC28 ( Figures S2 F and S2G). POP66 CPT-11-resistant tumors showed robust Ki-67 staining, indicating active tumor growth while on treatment ( Figure S2 H). Furthermore, POP66 and CSC28 long-term-treated tumors that did not grow on treatment also showed strong Ki-67 staining, suggesting that the tumor cells were cycling ( Figure S2 H). To determine whether the POP66 CPT-11 resistant tumors remained insensitive to therapy, we harvested viable tumor cells from the resistant tumors and injected them into new mice that were then treated with CPT-11 ( Figure S2 I). All three resistant tumors regrew while on treatment with CPT-11, indicating establishment of tumors that were irreversibly resistant, unlike tumors that went through a DTP state and regrew when CPT-11 treatment was stopped.
We conducted whole-exome sequencing (WES) to determine the genetic clonal and sub-clonal structure of our CRC models. Analysis of the single-nucleotide variant (SNV) allele fractions (VAFs) in diploid regions of the POP66 parent tumor (P0), first-generation xenograft (G0), and CPT-11 regrowth xenografts indicated the presence of subclones in the parent tumor and xenografts ( Figures S3 A and S3B). Furthermore, by utilizing the mutant allele tumor heterogeneity (MATH) score to measure the genetic intra-tumoral heterogeneity (ITH), we determined that there was no significant change in genetic ITH observed between POP66 P0, G0, and CPT-11 regrowth xenografts ( Figure S3 B). Similarly for CSC28, genetic ITH was maintained from G0 through to the treated xenografts (saline, DMSO, CPT-11 regrowth; Figure S3 C). MATH scores revealed that the POP66 CPT-11-resistant xenografts exhibited a significant decrease in genetic ITH compared with P0, G0, and CPT-11 regrowth tumors ( Figure S3 B), suggesting that they underwent genetic selection.
To further assess genetic ITH, we used the extensive mutational information from the POP66 and CSC28 WES data and subjected it to Pairtree computational analysis ( Data S1 ; Wintersinger et al., 2020 79. Wintersinger, J.A. ∙ Dobson, S.M. ∙ Dick, J.E. ... Pairtree: fast reconstruction of cancer evolutionary history using pairwise mutation relationships bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ; Dobson et al., 2020 17. Dobson, S.M. ∙ García-Prat, L. ∙ Vanner, R.J. ... Relapse-Fated Latent Diagnosis Subclones in Acute B Lineage Leukemia Are Drug Tolerant and Possess Distinct Metabolic Programs Cancer Discov. 2020; 10 :568-587 Crossref Scopus (69) PubMed Google Scholar ). Using SNVs from diploid regions across all of the POP66 or CSC28 set of tumors ( Data S1 ), we resolved unique subclones (POP66 = 26, CSC28 = 11) to construct clone trees describing the evolution of each cancer as a whole. We resolved a complex tree structure that demonstrated pervasive genetic ITH, with the proportions of each clone showing that every tumor sample (P0, G0, treated xenografts) is composed of multiple genetically distinct subpopulations ( Figures S3 D–S3G; Figure 1 in Data S1 ).
To compare the degree of genetic ITH between individual tumors, we analyzed each tumor independently using Pairtree (Figure 2 in Data S1 ; ). For each tumor under different treatment conditions, we resolved the genetic subclones present, the relationships between these clones, the proportions of each clone in the tumor, and degree of genetic ITH indicated by the mutational Shannon diversity index (MSDI; Figure 2 in Data S1 ; Figure S3 H) ( Wolf et al., 2019 80. Wolf, Y. ∙ Bartok, O. ∙ Patkar, S. ... UVB-Induced Tumor Heterogeneity Diminishes Immune Response in Melanoma Cell. 2019; 179 :219-235.e21 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (230) PubMed Google Scholar ). MSDI analysis supported our finding of pervasive ITH across POP66 and CSC28 P0, G0, vehicle, and CPT-11 regrowth xenografts and less genetic ITH in POP66 CPT-11-resistant xenografts ( Figure S3 H).
Our data establish that CPT-11-treated tumors that go through the DTP state do not demonstrate loss of genetic heterogeneity, unlike CPT-11-resistant tumors. Moreover, the absence of a decrease in genetic heterogeneity in the CPT-11 regrowth tumors, together with their retained sensitivity to CPT-11, is consistent with a non-genetic mechanism of drug tolerance.
To probe the clonal dynamics of the DTP state in vivo , we adapted a barcoding strategy to track individual cells within tumors ( Bhang et al., 2015 4. Bhang, H.E. ∙ Ruddy, D.A. ∙ Krishnamurthy Radhakrishna, V. ... Studying clonal dynamics in response to cancer therapy using high-complexity barcoding Nat. Med. 2015; 21 :440-448 Crossref Scopus (346) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, prior to injection, we infected cells of the two CRC patient-derived models described above with a high-complexity lentiviral barcode library (∼2.6 million variable DNA sequences or “barcodes”) at a low multiplicity of infection (MOI ≤ 0.1) to limit the number of multiple viral integrants. Following selection and in vitro expansion, cells were injected subcutaneously into the flanks of NOD/SCID mice ( Figure 2 A). A decrease in overall barcode complexity was observed following xenograft generation, where an engraftment efficiency of 5%–15% was determined based on barcode abundance in the expanded cell population used for the injections (T0) and the number of barcoded cells injected ( Table S2 ). Using spiked-in control barcodes, we confirmed that NGS can robustly quantify barcodes representing as few as 50 cells. The barcodes that were present at higher abundance at the time of injection into mice (T0) were generally not the most abundant barcodes in xenografts ( Figures 2 B, 2C, S4 A, and S4B), indicating no bias on the basis of initial barcode abundance.
To elucidate the effect of the DTP state on clonal complexity, barcode composition was compared between control and treatment groups, including treatment regimes that induced a DTP state (CPT-11, FOLFIRI) and those that did not induce a DTP state (5-FU/LV, OXA, FOLFOX). We hypothesized that tumors that went through the DTP state would demonstrate a decrease in barcode complexity and designed the experimental strategy so that we could determine whether the DTP subpopulation represented a pre-existing or de novo acquired cellular subset. Unexpectedly, no significant loss in barcode complexity was observed in CRC cells that went through the DTP state in vivo ( Figures 2 B–2E). Notably, the enriched barcodes were unique across all tumors ( Figures 2 B and 2C), indicating that there was no selection of a pre-existing cell subpopulation that gave rise to DTPs. Treatment with OXA and FOLFOX, which did not induce a DTP state, did not show any change in barcode complexity either. There were no significant differences in tumor weights at the time of sacrifice across all treatment groups, indicating no sequencing bias from the tumors ( Figures S4 C and S4D). Although there were significant differences in the time (days) when tumors grew in mice ( Figures S4 E and S4F), as expected considering the CPT-11 and FOLFIRI tumors went through a DTP state, these differences were not associated with any significant difference in the total number of barcodes detected ( Table S2 ), barcode complexity ( Figures 2 B–2E), or maximum clone size ( Figures S4 G and S4H). POP66 CPT-11-resistant tumors were the only tumors to demonstrate a significant decrease in clonal complexity ( Figures S4 I–S4K). Collectively, our findings show no loss of clonal complexity based on barcode composition of tumor cells that emerged from a DTP state, indicating that DTPs do not represent a cell subpopulation in these CRC models.
The results from the barcoding experiments were unexpected because, based on the significant decrease in tumor size during treatment, we expected a decrease in barcode complexity after tumors regrew following the DTP state. The lack of correlation in the identity of enriched barcodes among biological replicates of the experiment suggested that clonal dominance (evidenced by barcode enrichment) is not primarily driven by pre-existing selective advantages ( Shakiba et al., 2019 69. Shakiba, N. ∙ Fahmy, A. ∙ Jayakumaran, G. ... Cell competition during reprogramming gives rise to dominant clones Science. 2019; 364 :eaan0925 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, it remained unclear whether the observed variability in clonal output was due to some clones developing selective growth advantages. To address this, we first analyzed clone size distributions and observed that the barcode distributions remained largely “invariant” across the two control groups as well as the different chemotherapy treatment groups, including tumors that went through a DTP state ( Goyal et al., 2015 27. Goyal, S. ∙ Kim, S. ∙ Chen, I.S. ... Mechanisms of blood homeostasis: lineage tracking and a neutral model of cell populations in rhesus macaques BMC Biol. 2015; 13 :85 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ; Shakiba et al., 2019 69. Shakiba, N. ∙ Fahmy, A. ∙ Jayakumaran, G. ... Cell competition during reprogramming gives rise to dominant clones Science. 2019; 364 :eaan0925 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ). This invariance is shown visually by the overlapping cumulative fraction of clones ( Figures 3 A, 3B, S5 A, and S5B). The similarity in clonal dynamics between the control and treated tumors led us to hypothesize that the variability in clonal output is not primarily driven by developing fitness differences. This led us to question whether the observed barcode heterogeneity emerges from stochastic birth-death cellular dynamics where all cells are equipotent (i.e., no fitness differences across the population). To address this, we used more comprehensive mathematical modeling with clonal resolution.
Our mathematical model for clone size distribution accurately captured the experimentally observed clonal dynamics. A striking feature of the experimental clone sizes was the linear relationship between the cumulative fraction of clones and the relative clone size on a log-log plot. We found that this log-linear relationship ( Yule, 1925 81. Yule, G.U. II.—A mathematical theory of evolution, based on the conclusions of Dr. J. C. Willis, F. R. S Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1925; 213 :21-87 Crossref Google Scholar ), quantified as the slope on the log-log plot, was consistently between a tight range of 0.3–0.5 across all 80 tumors ( Figures 3 C and 3D). Our model demonstrated that this linear relationship naturally emerged from a proliferative hierarchy and sub-exponential (also referred to as logistic or power law) tumor growth kinetics ( Gaimann et al., 2020 25. Gaimann, M.U. ∙ Nguyen, M. ∙ Desponds, J. ... Early life imprints the hierarchy of T cell clone sizes arViv. 2020; arXiv:2007.11113 https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.11113 Google Scholar ), which has been widely observed and analyzed previously across many different tumors ( West and Newton, 2019 77. West, J. ∙ Newton, P.K. Cellular interactions constrain tumor growth Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2019; 116 :1918-1923 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ). In our model, injected cancer cells first exit the slow-cycling state into a fast-cycling state to form the tumor. The variability in clonal output in our model was primarily driven by the stochastic latency in exit from the slow-cycling state, while the slope depends on the tumor growth kinetics. In particular, if ˙ 𝑁 ∼ 𝑁 1 − 𝛼 , where 𝑁 is the size of the tumor and 𝛼 quantifies the deviation from exponential growth ( West and Newton, 2019 77. West, J. ∙ Newton, P.K. Cellular interactions constrain tumor growth Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2019; 116 :1918-1923 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 3 E; note that 𝛼 = 0 corresponds to exponential growth), the clone size distribution is 𝑝 ⁡ ( 𝑛 ) ∼ 𝑛 − ( 1 + 𝛼 ) , resulting in cumulative distribution 𝑄 ⁡ ( 𝑛 ) = ∑ 𝑘 > 𝑛 𝑝 ⁡ ( 𝑘 ) ∼ 𝑛 − 𝛼 ( Figure 3 F; see STAR Methods for model details). Our mathematical model demonstrates that tumor cells possess an equipotent capacity to form DTPs. Notably, the equipotency extends to the ability of cancer cells to enter the DTP state as well as their ability to exit the DTP state in a stochastic fashion.
We next performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to gain insight into the mechanisms that underlie the CPT-11-induced DTP state ( Table S3 ). The data revealed that DTPs are clearly distinct from vehicle-treated controls ( Figures 4 A–4C and S6 A), with 1,165 genes upregulated and 928 genes downregulated in the DTPs ( Figure 4 B; Table S4 ). Genes with roles in metabolism, cell cycle regulation, translation, and RNA processing are highly enriched among genes downregulated in DTPs ( Figures 4 D and S6 B; Table S5 ). Interestingly, cells that exited the DTP state and led to tumor regrowth are indistinguishable from vehicle-treated controls ( Figures 4 A–4C and S6 A). DTPs are also transcriptionally distinct from tumor cells that acquired resistance to CPT-11 upon continued long-term treatment and eventually gave rise to tumors while on CPT-11 ( Figures S6 C–S6E; Table S5 ). Thus, DTP cells represent a reversible state induced by drug treatment but unrelated to classic irreversible drug resistance.
The equipotent capacity of tumor cells to enter the DTP state for survival prompted us to examine whether the tumor cells were employing an evolutionary conserved mechanism to survive the environmental stress associated with chemotherapy exposure. Furthermore, the concerted downregulation of pathways (Myc and mTORc1) and crucial cellular growth processes (cell cycle, translation, and RNA processing) in DTPs recapitulated embryonic developmental pausing, also known as diapause ( Figures 4 D and S6 B). It has been shown previously that mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibition induces a reversible suspended pluripotent state in mouse blastocysts and embryonic stem cells (ESCs) ( Bulut-Karslioglu et al., 2016 8.

This paused state mimics diapause, a natural phenomenon of transient developmental arrest upon adverse environmental conditions ( Fenelon et al., 2014 24. Fenelon, J.C. ∙ Banerjee, A. ∙ Murphy, B.D. Embryonic diapause: development on hold Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2014; 58 :163-174 Crossref Scopus (95) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, we compared the transcriptomes of vehicle control, DTP-state, and CPT-11 regrowth tumors to previously published gene expression data of paused ESCs and in vivo diapaused embryos ( STAR Methods ; Table S4 ) and found that DTPs share significant similarities with both models ( Figures 4 E, 4F, and S6 E). We next compared the transcriptomes of vehicle control and DTP-state tumors with previously published gene expression data of various embryonic developmental stages, including diapause ( Boroviak et al., 2015 5.

Cell. 2015; 35 :366-382 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (298) PubMed Google Scholar ). This analysis shows extensive similarities between CPT-11 DTP-state tumors and diapaused epiblasts but not other embryonic developmental stages ( Figure S6 F). To further explore this relationship, we combined expression data from in vitro- paused ESCs with in vivo embryonic diapause to develop a gene expression signature characteristic of embryonic pausing ( STAR Methods ; Table S6 ; Boroviak et al., 2015 5.

Inhibition of mTOR induces a paused pluripotent state Nature. 2016; 540 :119-123 Crossref Scopus (163) PubMed Google Scholar ). Compared with vehicle control or CPT-11 regrowth tumors, DTP-state tumors have the highest embryonic pausing signature score, indicating that changes in their transcriptome resemble that of paused ESCs and embryonic diapause ( Figures 4 G, S6 G, and S6H). These similarities were further corroborated by analyses of expression signatures of specific signaling pathways associated with embryonic diapause, where DTPs expressed significantly reduced levels of mTOR and Myc response modules ( Figures 4 D, S6 I, and S6J; Bulut-Karslioglu et al., 2016 8.

Conversely, DTPs also express increased levels of diapause-associated autophagy genes ( Figure S6 K; Bulut-Karslioglu et al., 2016 8. Bulut-Karslioglu, A. ∙ Biechele, S. ∙ Jin, H. ...

Together, these data reveal that CPT-11-induced DTPs are in a reversible state with extensive transcriptional similarities to embryonic diapause, hereafter referred to as a diapause-like DTP state.
Therapeutic pressure has been shown to drive cancer cells into a DTP state to survive the insult by entering a low proliferative state ( Hangauer et al., 2017 31.

Rep. 2019; 9 :11905 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although we observed low Ki-67 expression for tumors in the diapause-like DTP state ( Figures 1 F and 1G), we performed in vivo bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling to determine the percentage of cancer cells that were cycling while in the DTP state. We first established three additional CRC PDX models of the in vivo CPT-11-induced DTP state ( Figures 5 A, S7 A, and S7B; Table S1 ). A subset of mice were administered BrdU during weeks 3 and 4 of CPT-11 treatment, and tumors were harvested at the end of treatment (4 weeks). BrdU incorporation analysis revealed that almost all tumor cells were positive, with no significant difference in percentage of BrdU positivity between DMSO- and CPT-11-treated tumors ( Figure 5 B), establishing that the vast majority of cells in the DTP state in vivo are cycling, albeit slowly.
We next explored the biology of the DTP state in vitro using CRC models treated with CPT-11 at 1 μM, a concentration found to cause 50% growth inhibition (GI 50 ). POP66, POP92, and CSC28 cultures treated with CPT-11 demonstrated significant growth suppression but resumed growth upon drug withdrawal on day 14 ( Figures 5 C and 5D), indicating that CRC cultures also enter a reversible DTP state upon CPT-11 treatment in vitro . Consistent with previous reports of the effect of CPT-11 on tumor cells ( Kaku et al., 2015 38. Kaku, Y. ∙ Tsuchiya, A. ∙ Kanno, T. ... Irinotecan induces cell cycle arrest, but not apoptosis or necrosis, in Caco-2 and CW2 colorectal cancer cell lines Pharmacology. 2015; 95 :154-159 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2018 76. Wang, Y. ∙ Yang, L. ∙ Zhang, J. ... Radiosensitization by irinotecan is attributed to G2/M phase arrest, followed by enhanced apoptosis, probably through the ATM/Chk/Cdc25C/Cdc2 pathway in p53-mutant colorectal cancer cells Int. J. Oncol. 2018; 53 :1667-1680 PubMed Google Scholar ), we found that CPT-11 induced a stall in S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle and a decrease in the G1 fraction ( Figure 5 E). However, although cell cycle progression was slightly altered, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) Hallmarks analysis shows that the transcriptomes of tumors in the diapause-like DTP state, diapaused embryos, and paused ESCs are very distinct from the published transcriptomic profiles of various cell cycle arrest models ( Figure S7 C). In addition, western blot analysis showed no induction of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors in POP66 and POP92 DTP-state cells ( Figure S7 D). We observed a small but statistically significant increase in apoptosis for POP66 and CSC28 in response to CPT-11 treatment but not for POP92 ( Figure 5 F). Label retention experiments ( Quayle et al., 2018 59. Quayle, L.A. ∙ Ottewell, P.D. ∙ Holen, I. Chemotherapy resistance and stemness in mitotically quiescent human breast cancer cells identified by fluorescent dye retention Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 2018; 35 :831-846 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ) revealed dilution of the Vybrant DiD dye at a much slower rate in CPT-11-treated cultures compared with the control ( Figures 5 G and S7 E). Additionally, CPT-11-treated cultures exhibited a significant decrease in total RNA abundance ( Figure S7 F), consistent with the global suppression of transcription seen in embryonic diapause ( Bulut-Karslioglu et al., 2016 8. Bulut-Karslioglu, A. ∙ Biechele, S. ∙ Jin, H. ... Inhibition of mTOR induces a paused pluripotent state Nature. 2016; 540 :119-123 Crossref Scopus (163) PubMed Google Scholar ). These data suggest that, similar to our in vivo BrdU results as well as diapaused blastocysts ( Bulut-Karslioglu et al., 2016 8. Bulut-Karslioglu, A. ∙ Biechele, S. ∙ Jin, H. ... Inhibition of mTOR induces a paused pluripotent state Nature. 2016; 540 :119-123 Crossref Scopus (163) PubMed Google Scholar ), in vitro CPT-11-treated cultures in the DTP state are slow cycling and enter a diapause-like state to survive chemotherapeutic stress.
Guided by our RNA-seq analysis of tumors in the diapause-like DTP state, we sought to identify specific pathways that drive DTP formation. Diapaused blastocysts are known to downregulate cellular transcription and translation programs via key pathways such as mTOR ( Bulut-Karslioglu et al., 2016 8. Bulut-Karslioglu, A. ∙ Biechele, S. ∙ Jin, H. ... Inhibition of mTOR induces a paused pluripotent state Nature. 2016; 540 :119-123 Crossref Scopus (163) PubMed Google Scholar ; Scognamiglio et al., 2016 67. Scognamiglio, R. ∙ Cabezas-Wallscheid, N. ∙ Thier, M.C. ... Myc Depletion Induces a Pluripotent Dormant State Mimicking Diapause Cell. 2016; 164 :668-680 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (184) PubMed Google Scholar ). In line with RNA-seq analysis of tumors in the diapause-like DTP state that revealed significant downregulation of the mTOR pathway ( Figure S6 I), western blot analysis of DTP-state cultures also showed a decrease in mTOR signaling ( Figure 6 A). Because previous reports have shown that the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is activated upon mTOR inhibition ( Carracedo et al., 2008 10. Carracedo, A. ∙ Ma, L. ∙ Teruya-Feldstein, J. ... Inhibition of mTORC1 leads to MAPK pathway activation through a PI3K-dependent feedback loop in human cancer J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118 :3065-3074 PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhang et al., 2017 82. Zhang, X. ∙ Yang, H. ∙ Yue, S. ... The mTOR inhibition in concurrence with ERK1/2 activation is involved in excessive autophagy induced by glycyrrhizin in hepatocellular carcinoma Cancer Med. 2017; 6 :1941-1951 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ), we also observed extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK 1/2) activation in DTP-state cultures by western blot analysis ( Figure 6 A). Furthermore, similar to CPT-11-treated cells, POP92 and CSC28 cultures treated with the mTORC1/2 inhibitor INK 128 (GI 50 , 25 nM) showed significant growth suppression but no increase in apoptosis compared with DMSO-treated controls ( Figures 6 B and 6C; Hsieh et al., 2012 35. Hsieh, A.C. ∙ Liu, Y. ∙ Edlind, M.P. ... The translational landscape of mTOR signalling steers cancer initiation and metastasis Nature. 2012; 485 :55-61 Crossref Scopus (991) PubMed Google Scholar ). The cultures resumed growth upon withdrawal of the mTOR inhibitor on day 14 ( Figure 6 B). These data indicate that, similar to CPT-11 treatment, CRC cells enter a reversible DTP state upon mTOR inhibition. This finding supports the functional similarities between mTOR inhibition-dependent diapaused blastocysts and paused ESCs and the CRC diapause-like DTP state we identified ( Bulut-Karslioglu et al., 2016 8. Bulut-Karslioglu, A. ∙ Biechele, S. ∙ Jin, H. ... Inhibition of mTOR induces a paused pluripotent state Nature. 2016; 540 :119-123 Crossref Scopus (163) PubMed Google Scholar ).
mTOR is known to phosphorylate and inactivate autophagy regulators ( Chan, 2009 12. Chan, E.Y. mTORC1 phosphorylates the ULK1-mAtg13-FIP200 autophagy regulatory complex Sci. Signal. 2009; 2 :pe51 Crossref Scopus (190) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the context of diapaused blastocysts, mTOR downregulation results in upregulation of key autophagy genes, including ULK1/ATG1 ( Bulut-Karslioglu et al., 2016 8. Bulut-Karslioglu, A. ∙ Biechele, S. ∙ Jin, H. ... Inhibition of mTOR induces a paused pluripotent state Nature. 2016; 540 :119-123 Crossref Scopus (163) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, induction of autophagy plays a key functional role in mediating diapause because blastocysts treated with an autophagy inhibitor (the ULK1 inhibitor SBI-0206965) exit the diapaused state ( Bulut-Karslioglu et al., 2016 8. Bulut-Karslioglu, A. ∙ Biechele, S. ∙ Jin, H. ... Inhibition of mTOR induces a paused pluripotent state Nature. 2016; 540 :119-123 Crossref Scopus (163) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lee et al., 2011 47. Lee, J.E. ∙ Oh, H.A. ∙ Song, H. ... Autophagy regulates embryonic survival during delayed implantation Endocrinology. 2011; 152 :2067-2075 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistent with these published findings, RNA-seq analysis of tumors in the diapause-like DTP state demonstrated upregulation of key autophagy genes ( Figure S6 K). These results were further confirmed in vitro , where diapause-like DTP cultures showed a decrease in inhibitory phosphorylated ULK1 and an increase in ATG13 and LC3 protein expression ( Figure 6 D) in addition to increased gene expression of multiple autophagy pathway mediators ( Figure 6 E).
We identified ULK1 as a targetable protein in the pathway and treated cells with SBI-0206965 (SBI; GI 50 , 2.5 μM) ( Egan et al., 2015 20. Egan, D.F. ∙ Chun, M.G. ∙ Vamos, M. ... Small Molecule Inhibition of the Autophagy Kinase ULK1 and Identification of ULK1 Substrates Mol. Cell. 2015; 59 :285-297 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (521) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although all CRC cultures exhibited significant growth delay in response to SBI treatment alone, the cells resumed proliferation when SBI treatment was discontinued ( Figure 6 F). Cultures treated with CPT-11 responded as described above, with induction of the diapause-like DTP state followed by recovery when CPT-11 treatment was discontinued. In contrast, cells treated with CPT-11 and SBI combination therapy resulted in significant growth suppression with negligible recovery when treatment was stopped. Combination treatment resulted in significant induction of apoptosis compared with DMSO, CPT-11, or SBI treatment alone ( Figure 6 G). Furthermore, combination treatment of cells with CPT-11 and chloroquine (CQ; 20 μM), a general autophagy inhibitor, resulted in robust induction of apoptosis compared with either treatment alone ( Figure S7 G). These data show that, similar to diapaused blastocysts, the diapause-like DTP state in our CRC models is dependent on upregulation of the autophagy program and that targeting this pathway with an ULK1 inhibitor prevents its manifestation.
We sought to investigate whether the embryonic pausing signature that defines our tumors in the diapause-like DTP state can also define what is noted in literature as minimal residual disease (MRD) in cancer. Interestingly, MRD transcriptomes derived from animal models and individuals across a range of tumor types (acute lymphoblastic leukemia, prostate cancer, and melanoma) significantly correlated with the embryonic pausing signature, similar to tumors in the diapause-like DTP state ( Figure 7 A; Ebinger et al., 2016 18. Ebinger, S. ∙ Özdemir, E.Z. ∙ Ziegenhain, C. ...

Neoadjuvant-Intensive Androgen Deprivation Therapy Selects for Prostate Tumor Foci with Diverse Subclonal Oncogenic Alterations Cancer Res. 2018; 78 :4716-4730 Crossref Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ). This suggests that our embryonic pausing signature can identify MRD.
Given the potential role of DTPs in mediating therapeutic outcome and tumor relapse, we investigated whether our signature, which defined tumors in the diapause-like DTP state, could provide prognostic stratification in the TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) cohort of individuals with CRC ( Cancer Genome Atlas, 2012 9. Cancer Genome Atlas, N., Cancer Genome Atlas Network Comprehensive molecular characterization of human colon and rectal cancer Nature. 2012; 487 :330-337 Crossref Scopus (6404) PubMed Google Scholar ). The samples from individuals with CRC were divided into two groups, defined as having a “high” or “low” embryonic pausing signature. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that individuals with a high signature score had significantly worse overall survival than individuals with a low signature score ( Figure 7 B). Furthermore, we analyzed this CRC TCGA dataset for the autophagy signature (Gene Ontology [GO]: 0010506). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that individuals with CRC who had a high autophagy score had significantly worse overall survival than those with a low autophagy score ( Figure 7 C). We extended our analysis to various cancers of the TCGA and found that, for the indicated cancer cohorts, a high autophagy signature corresponds to poor overall survival (p < 0.05; hazard ratio [HR]; Figure 7 D). These data suggest that patients with a high diapause or autophagy score have tumor cells that would be refractory to therapy. We propose that this signature provides a way to identify individuals with refractory disease and uncovers innovative therapeutic intervention strategies to target the diapause-like DTP state responsible for relapse.

Section: Discussion

In this study, we leveraged cellular barcoding in two CRC PDX models to show that there is no loss of genetic or barcode heterogeneity in cancer cells that go through a chemotherapy-induced DTP state. Instead, our results demonstrate that cancer cells are equipotent in their capacity to enter the DTP state, which they accomplish by activating the evolutionarily conserved survival strategy of diapause. Similar to diapause, the diapause-like DTP state is characterized by a decrease in mTOR pathway activity and an increase in autophagy ( Bulut-Karslioglu et al., 2016 8. Bulut-Karslioglu, A. ∙ Biechele, S. ∙ Jin, H. ... Inhibition of mTOR induces a paused pluripotent state Nature. 2016; 540 :119-123 Crossref Scopus (163) PubMed Google Scholar ). Combination treatment of chemotherapy and autophagy inhibitors induced DTP cell death, providing insight into therapeutic opportunities to target cancer cells in the diapause-like DTP state.
Some studies indicate that DTPs pre-exist in the original cancer cell population and that chemotherapy exposure promotes selection of this subpopulation or that chemotherapy induces a phenotypic transition to a DTP state in a subpopulation of tumor cells ( Guler et al., 2017 28.

A temporarily distinct subpopulation of slow-cycling melanoma cells is required for continuous tumor growth Cell. 2010; 141 :583-594 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (943) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our experiments were designed so that there would be multiple tumors with comparable starting barcode populations, allowing us to distinguish pre-existing from DTP clones acquired de novo . If a pre-existing cancer cell subpopulation was the major source of DTPs, then we would expect to see selective enrichment of the same barcodes in replicate tumors. However, if DTPs were driven by a stochastic process, then we would expect distinct barcoded populations to emerge in independent tumor replicates ( Bhang et al., 2015 4. Bhang, H.E. ∙ Ruddy, D.A. ∙ Krishnamurthy Radhakrishna, V. ... Studying clonal dynamics in response to cancer therapy using high-complexity barcoding Nat.

In our models, the same barcodes were not detected across replicate tumors, indicating that DTPs were not a pre-existing subset.
We anticipated that the bottleneck associated with DTP formation in our models would be reflected in loss of barcode complexity ( Guler et al., 2017 28. Guler, G.D. ∙ Tindell, C.A. ∙ Pitti, R. ... Repression of Stress-Induced LINE-1 Expression Protects Cancer Cell Subpopulations from Lethal Drug Exposure Cancer Cell. 2017; 32 :221-237.e13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (149) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sharma et al., 2010 70.

A chromatin-mediated reversible drug-tolerant state in cancer cell subpopulations Cell. 2010; 141 :69-80 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1900) PubMed Google Scholar ). Unexpectedly, no significant selection was observed based on barcode complexity in tumors that regrew following the DTP state. It could be proposed that the observed barcode variability across tumors is driven by selective dynamics of multiple rapidly mutating clones ( Shakiba et al., 2019 69. Shakiba, N. ∙ Fahmy, A. ∙ Jayakumaran, G. ... Cell competition during reprogramming gives rise to dominant clones Science. 2019; 364 :eaan0925 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, WES analysis did not reveal any significant generation of mutations in regrowth tumors, negating this possibility. Instead, quantitative analysis of barcode composition suggested that the observed variability in barcode complexity is explained by a model that combines proliferative hierarchy with sub-exponential tumor growth kinetics ( Goyal et al., 2015 27. Goyal, S. ∙ Kim, S. ∙ Chen, I.S. ...

Cellular interactions constrain tumor growth Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2019; 116 :1918-1923 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here the barcode complexity does not result from genetic diversity based on selective dynamics of cells with fitness differences but results from stochastic latency in the exit times from a slow-cycling state ( Lan et al., 2017 46. Lan, X. ∙ Jörg, D.J. ∙ Cavalli, F.M.G. ... Fate mapping of human glioblastoma reveals an invariant stem cell hierarchy Nature. 2017; 549 :227-232 Crossref Scopus (269) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, our data strongly support the “equipotent” model, in which all tumor cells have equal capacity to enter and exit the DTP state to survive therapy, refuting the idea that a small subpopulation of cells in the parent tumor are capable of becoming DTPs.
There is increasing interest in approaching therapeutic strategies in cancer by maintaining tumor cells in a DTP state. However, our prolonged treatment of a subset of mice with CPT-11 (5–6 months) suggests that, over time, tumors in the DTP state act as a reservoir for development of genetically resistant clones. Tumors that grew out while on prolonged CPT-11 treatment had decreased genetic diversity, indicating that genetic clonal selection occurred while the cells remained in the prolonged DTP state. Our findings are consistent with those of Ramirez et al. (2016) 61. Ramirez, M. ∙ Rajaram, S. ∙ Steininger, R.J. ... Diverse drug-resistance mechanisms can emerge from drug-tolerant cancer persister cells Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 :10690 Crossref Scopus (356) PubMed Google Scholar , who demonstrated that persister-derived erlotinib-resistant colonies acquired diverse resistance mechanisms over time, suggesting that the DTP state provides a latent reservoir of cells for emergence of drug-resistant clones. In light of this and our findings, tumor cells should not be held in a persister state. Instead, therapeutic strategies should be developed to eliminate persisters or prevent their formation.
Transcriptional profiling of tumors in the DTP state showed gene expression patterns that closely resembled hormonally and chemically induced diapause. Although the molecular mechanisms governing mouse embryonic diapause remain largely unknown, two recent studies identified downregulation of the Myc and mTOR pathways as a key player in embryonic diapause ( Bulut-Karslioglu et al., 2016 8.

Inhibition of Myc in mouse ESCs in vitro resembled diapause in blastocysts in vivo , and inhibition of Myc for 18 h in blastocysts was compatible with development to term ( Scognamiglio et al., 2016 67. Scognamiglio, R. ∙ Cabezas-Wallscheid, N. ∙ Thier, M.C. ... Myc Depletion Induces a Pluripotent Dormant State Mimicking Diapause Cell. 2016; 164 :668-680 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (184) PubMed Google Scholar ). Inhibition of mTOR induced reversible pausing of mouse blastocyst development and allowed their prolonged culture ex vivo up to 22 days while retaining the ability to develop to term ( Bulut-Karslioglu et al., 2016 8. Bulut-Karslioglu, A. ∙ Biechele, S. ∙ Jin, H. ... Inhibition of mTOR induces a paused pluripotent state Nature. 2016; 540 :119-123 Crossref Scopus (163) PubMed Google Scholar ). Interestingly, following Myc depletion, murine blastocysts entered a dormant state, exiting the cell cycle ( Scognamiglio et al., 2016 67. Scognamiglio, R. ∙ Cabezas-Wallscheid, N. ∙ Thier, M.C. ... Myc Depletion Induces a Pluripotent Dormant State Mimicking Diapause Cell. 2016; 164 :668-680 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (184) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast, the diapause state induced ex vivo by mTOR inhibition was not associated with dormancy but a slow-cycling state ( Bulut-Karslioglu et al., 2016 8. Bulut-Karslioglu, A. ∙ Biechele, S. ∙ Jin, H. ... Inhibition of mTOR induces a paused pluripotent state Nature. 2016; 540 :119-123 Crossref Scopus (163) PubMed Google Scholar ). Similar to the mTOR inhibitor-induced diapause state, CPT-11-induced DTPs in our study were not arrested and remained engaged in a slow-cycling state for a prolonged time period. Furthermore, naturally diapaused blastocysts in vivo and paused blastocysts ex vivo displayed pronounced reductions in mTOR activity, alterations in chromatin modifications, hypotranscription, and activation of the key autophagy regulator ULK1 ( Bulut-Karslioglu et al., 2016 8. Bulut-Karslioglu, A. ∙ Biechele, S. ∙ Jin, H. ... Inhibition of mTOR induces a paused pluripotent state Nature. 2016; 540 :119-123 Crossref Scopus (163) PubMed Google Scholar ). Autophagy was shown to play an important functional role because paused blastocysts co-treated with autophagy inhibitors (the ULK1 inhibitor SBI or CQ) resulted in decreased survival of the paused state. Here, downregulation of the Myc and mTOR modules as well as upregulation of key autophagy genes were observed when tumors were in the diapause-like DTP state. Furthermore, co-treatment with autophagy inhibitors and CPT-11 significantly inhibited acquisition of a DTP state and resulted in robust cell death. Thus, DTPs not only transcriptionally recapitulate diapause but also functionally depend on pathways that drive embryonic viability during diapause.
The understanding of DTPs is at a relatively nascent stage, and whether DTPs differ depending on specific chemotherapies or targeted agents is currently not established. Some of the key driver genes and pathways identified in DTP models to date include GPX4, LINE-1 repression, IGF-1R, and oxidative phosphorylation ( Echeverria et al., 2019 19. Echeverria, G.V. ∙ Ge, Z. ∙ Seth, S. ... Resistance to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in triple-negative breast cancer mediated by a reversible drug-tolerant state Sci. Transl.

A chromatin-mediated reversible drug-tolerant state in cancer cell subpopulations Cell. 2010; 141 :69-80 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1900) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, we identified that DTPs activate a developmentally conserved program to survive the harsh environment created by chemotherapy, and understanding this mechanism will be key to devising methods to target this state. Future studies of the diapause-like DTP state in the context of cancer should include developing robust PDX preclinical DTP models in response to standard-of-care chemotherapy and targeted agents as well as syngeneic models that expand our understanding of how the diapause-like DTP state is influenced by the immune system. Targeting the diapause-like DTP state will be essential for developing therapeutic strategies designed to eliminate cancer cells when they are potentially in their most vulnerable state.

NOD/SCID mice were used in this study and were bred in our Animal Facility, originally purchased from The Jackson laboratory. Prior to all experiments, mice were allowed one week to acclimate to housing conditions in the UHN Animal Resources Centre animal facility. For maintenance of patient-derived xenografts models, cells from frozen xenograft samples were mixed (1:1) with high concentration Matrigel (Corning, Cat # 354262) and injected subcutaneously into the flanks of NOD/SCID mice (male, 6-8 weeks old). For all experiments, 5-6 weeks old female mice were used. All mice were housed in specific pathogen-free conditions and all animal experiments were reviewed and approved by the Animal Care Committee at the University Health Network, Toronto, Canada.
Human CRC tissue was obtained with informed patient consent, as approved by the Research Ethics Board at the University Health Network in Toronto, and was processed as previously described ( Kreso et al., 2014 45. Kreso, A. ∙ van Galen, P. ∙ Pedley, N.M. ... Self-renewal as a therapeutic target in human colorectal cancer Nat. Med. 2014; 20 :29-36 Crossref Scopus (411) PubMed Google Scholar ). CRC models used in this study are of female origin and are listed in Table S1 .
CRC cultures established directly from patient tissue (CSC28) or from PDXs (POP66 and POP92 ( O’Brien et al., 2012 57. O’Brien, C.A. ∙ Kreso, A. ∙ Ryan, P. ... ID1 and ID3 regulate the self-renewal capacity of human colon cancer-initiating cells through p21 Cancer Cell. 2012; 21 :777-792 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (177) PubMed Google Scholar ), and the commercially available cell line (HT29; ATCC Cat# HTB-38, RRID:CVCL_0320) were grown as spheroids in suspension culture flasks at 37°C in a humidified incubator at 5% CO 2 , as previously described ( Kreso et al., 2014 45. Kreso, A. ∙ van Galen, P. ∙ Pedley, N.M. ... Self-renewal as a therapeutic target in human colorectal cancer Nat. Med. 2014; 20 :29-36 Crossref Scopus (411) PubMed Google Scholar ). All cell culture models are of female origin. The culture medium contained DMEM/F-12 (GIBCO) supplemented with 2 mM GlutaMAX (GIBCO), 10 mM HEPES (GIBCO), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (HyClone), 1X non-essential amino acids (HyClone), 1% penicillin-streptomycin (HyClone), 0.5 μg/ml Fungizone (GIBCO), 1% N2 Supplement-A (STEMCELL), 0.4% NeuroCult SM1 Neuronal Supplement (STEMCELL), 4 μg/ml, Heparin (Sigma), 0.2% lipids (Sigma), 20 ng/ml EGF (Reprokine), and 10 ng/ml basic FGF (Reprokine). All models were authenticated by STR analysis and confirmed to be negative for mycoplasma.
Oligonucleotides comprising a 12 base pair degenerate region (the barcode) followed by two stable bases (C or G), and one of several 4 base pair library codes were synthesized with common flanking regions. Nested PCR using the common regions generated double stranded DNA which was subsequently ligated into a second-generation lentiviral vector (pLJM1) containing a puromycin resistance cassette and ZsGreen fluorescent marker. Three barcode libraries, each identifiable by a unique library code were cloned, transformed into E. coli and plated as a pool on solid media. At least 5x10 6 bacterial colonies were scraped and pooled for two of the high diversity libraries. Plasmid DNA was maxi-prepped, and a sample was sequenced to confirm diversity of > 10 6 unique barcodes. These libraries are named Library 0 and Library 1. The third library was generated for use as standard spike-in controls. Single colonies were selected, prepped and Sanger sequenced to identify several standard barcodes.
Lentivirus containing barcode plasmid libraries were produced in HEK293T (ATCC Cat# CRL-11268, RRID:CVCL_1926) cells. Virus was titered for both POP66 and CSC28 cultures and the desired MOI was calculated as previously described ( Hart et al., 2015 32. Hart, T. ∙ Chandrashekhar, M. ∙ Aregger, M. ... High-Resolution CRISPR Screens Reveal Fitness Genes and Genotype-Specific Cancer Liabilities Cell. 2015; 163 :1515-1526 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1012) PubMed Google Scholar ). CRC cultures were dissociated and filtered through a 40 μm cell strainer to remove clumps. Cells were diluted to 1.5-2 × 10 5 cells per ml in culture medium containing a pre-determined concentration of polybrene (3-4 μg/ml; Sigma, Cat # TR-1003) and virus was added at a multiplicity of infection of ≤ 0.1 to minimize the number of cells with multiple barcodes. After a 24-hour incubation, cells were washed, then resuspended in fresh culture medium and incubated further. At ∼60 hours post-infection, cells were dissociated and barcoded cells (ZsGreen+) were purified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) using FACSAria cell sorters (BD Biosciences) and SYTOX Blue nucleic acid stain (Invitrogen) to exclude dead cells. After sorting, an aliquot of the initial barcoded cell pool was designated as time t = 0 (T0) and snap-frozen for subsequent DNA extraction. The remaining barcoded cells were seeded in a flask and expanded in culture for 8 doubling times (∼256-fold representation) to provide multiple replicates with comparable starting barcode representations and the complexity to decipher pre-existing from de novo acquired DTP populations. Cells were passaged as necessary to avoid spheroid overgrowth. Cells were then dissociated, counted and immediately used for downstream applications or viably frozen.
5-FU was purchased from Sigma (Cat # F6627), LV (Calcium Folinate) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Cat # sc252837A), OXA from Tocris Bioscience (Cat # 2623), CPT-11 from Sigma (Cat # I1406), INK 128 from Selleckchem, (Cat # S2811), SBI-0206965 from Selleckchem (Cat # S7885) and Chloroquine from Sigma (Cat # C6628). For in vitro studies, CPT-11, INK 128 and SBI-0206965 were dissolved in DMSO, and Chloroquine was dissolved in water. For in vivo studies, 5-FU, LV, and OXA were dissolved directly in saline, whereas CPT-11 was first dissolved in DMSO (90 mg/ml) and then diluted in saline. Dilutions of stock solutions of all drugs were made in culture medium immediately prior to use in vitro or administration in vivo .
Dissociated CRC cells were mixed (1:1) with high concentration Matrigel (Corning, Cat # 354262), and injected subcutaneously (1x10 5 for POP66, 2x10 5 for CSC28, 2.5x10 5 for POP92, 1x10 6 for POP133, 2x10 5 for HT-29) into the hind left and right flanks of female NOD/SCID mice, 5-6 weeks of age (2 injections per mouse). When the average tumor volume reached ∼100 mm 3 , tumor-bearing mice were randomized into control and treatment groups based on tumor volumes, and dosing commenced on day 0. All chemotherapies were administered by intraperitoneal injection (8 weeks for POP66 and CSC28; 4 weeks for POP92, POP133 and HT-29) or until combined tumor burden reached 1.5 cm total diameter. Treatment regimens were as follows: Vehicle-Saline control (Saline only, three times per week); Vehicle-DMSO control (Saline + 5% DMSO, twice per week); 5-FU (15 mg/kg, three times per week) and LV (20 mg/kg, three times per week); OXA (1 mg/kg, twice per week); CPT-11 (45 mg/kg, twice per week); FOLFOX (5-FU + LV + OXA); FOLFIRI (5-FU + LV + CPT-11). When combination therapies were given on the same day, 5-FU and LV were administered 1 hour before OXA or CPT-11. Body weights were measured every 1-3 days over the course of treatment, and tumor growth was monitored by caliper measurements every 1-4 days until endpoint was reached and mice were euthanized.
Mice bearing tumors were first treated with DMSO or CPT-11 for 2 weeks. Then BrdU (5 mg/ml; Sigma, Cat # B5002) dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was administered by intraperitoneal injection (50 mg/kg) three times a week for 2 additional weeks while on treatment with DMSO or CPT-11.
The xenograft tumors harvested after sacrifice were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin, then serially sectioned (4 μm) thickness, and subjected to histopathological analysis. Tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, TUNEL stain (DNA Polymerase 1 Large (Klenow) Fragment from Promega; dATP, dCTP, dGTP from Promega, Cat # M2201; Bio-11-dUTP from Cedarlane) ( Wijsman et al., 1993 78. Wijsman, J.H. ∙ Jonker, R.R. ∙ Keijzer, R. ... A new method to detect apoptosis in paraffin sections: in situ end-labeling of fragmented DNA J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1993; 41 :7-12 Crossref Scopus (852) PubMed Google Scholar ), Ki-67 antibody (Novus Biologicals, Cat # NB110-90592, RRID: AB_1217069 ) and BrdU antibody (Abcam, Cat# ab6326, RRID: AB_305426 ) following the manufacturer’s instructions. All slides were counterstained with hematoxylin and assessed under light microscopy. For IHC analysis – TUNEL expression levels were semi-quantified using immunoreactive scores (IRS range 0-12). Score definitions: 0 (score 0-3), 1+ (score 4-6), 2+ (score 7-9), 3+ (score 10-12). For Ki-67 and BrdU percent positivity, 10 fields were randomly chosen, and the average percentage of positive cells determined. All slides were assessed by a pathologist. Slides were scanned on the Aperio Scanscope AT2 Whole Slide Scanner using a 20x objective.
Tumors were excised from mice, minced with a razor blade, and incubated in medium (DMEM/F-12, GIBCO) containing collagenase A (Roche) at 37°C for 60 minutes. After enzymatic digestion, samples were diluted in wash medium and filtered through a 40 μm cell strainer to remove undigested tissue. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 450 × g for 6 minutes, then resuspended in ammonium chloride solution (STEMCELL, Cat # 07800) and incubated at room temperature for 6 minutes to lyse red blood cells. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 minutes, then resuspended in Dulbecco’s PBS (DPBS) and counted. Cells were immediately used for downstream applications or viably frozen.
Genomic DNA was extracted from barcoded tumors using the Gentra Puregene Tissue Kit (QIAGEN, Cat # 158689) with modifications. Briefly, 5 × 10 6 viably frozen tumor cells were thawed on ice and collected by centrifuging at 400 × g for 5 minutes. Cell pellets and the appropriate barcode standards were resuspended and combined in Cell Lysis Solution, then Puregene Proteinase K was added (133 μg/ml final concentration) and samples were incubated at 55°C overnight. The next day, RNase A Solution was added (20 μg/ml final concentration) and samples were incubated at 37°C for 1 hour, after which Protein Precipitation Solution was added, then samples were vortexed and transferred to a 2 mL MaXtract HD tube (QIAGEN). After 1-2 rounds of extraction with Phenol-Chloroform-Isoamyl Alcohol (25:24:1; Sigma, Cat # P3803), the upper layer was transferred to a new MaXtract tube and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 3 minutes. The resulting upper layer was then transferred to a new microcentrifuge tube and DNA was precipitated with isopropanol followed by a 70% ethanol wash. DNA pellets were resuspended in 100 μl nuclease-free water and incubated at 65°C for 1 hour, followed by incubation at room temperature overnight on a tube rotator. DNA was quantified using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). Genomic DNA was extracted from barcoded T0 cultures using the QIAamp Blood Midi Kit (QIAGEN, Cat # 51185) following the manufacturer’s Spin Protocol. Frozen cell pellets containing 3-10 × 10 6 barcoded cells were used and the appropriate barcode standards were included. Eluted DNA was precipitated with ethanol in the presence of sodium chloride followed by a 70% ethanol wash. DNA pellets were resuspended in nuclease-free water and incubated at 50°C for 1 hour. DNA was quantified using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific) and adjusted to a final concentration of 400 ng/μl.
Genomic DNA for all samples is standardized to 400ng/μl in nuclease-free water. Sequencing libraries were constructed by PCR amplification using a common 3′ primer “BL Seq Amp 3′: AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCT and one of 166 unique 5′ primers “BL Seq Amp 5′ XXX”:
CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGAT NNNNNN CGATTAGTGAACGGATCTCGACGGT where the N’s represent a unique sample index. Barcode index primers are provided in Table S2 . Each gDNA sample was amplified in technical triplicate with unique indexes using ExTaq (Takara, Cat # RR001A) with the PCR program: 95°C for 5 minutes, 94°C for 30 s, 65°C for 30 s, 72°C for 30 s and back to step 2, 32x followed by a 5 minute hold at 72°C. PCR efficiency was assessed by running the product on a 3% agarose gel. The 137 bp barcode library band was quantified using Bio Rad Image Lab software. Equal amounts of each PCR product were pooled into batches and PAGE purified using 15% TBE PAGE gels (Novex). Purified PCR products were quantified using Qubit, pooled and run on an Illumina HiSeq2500 using version 4 chemistry and Illumina sequencing primer: ACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT and custom primer: ATCGATACCGTCGAGATCCGTTCACTAATCG for multiplexed sample ID. Samples were demultiplexed and barcode abundances analyzed.
FASTQ files for each sample were analyzed using a bespoke Perl script. Each read was processed to identify one of the three expected library codes (CCAA, ACGT, or TGGA) followed by eight bases corresponding to the vector sequence (eg: ATCGATAC), allowing up to one mismatched base for each feature and ignoring quality values. Reads lacking both of these sequences were discarded. The nucleotide sequence corresponding to the barcode was then extracted as the 18 nucleotides preceding the vector sequence, and all unique barcodes were enumerated. Barcode summary files were then merged into a single matrix. Noise introduced through sequencing or PCR errors was reduced by summing counts for barcodes within a Hamming distance of two into a single barcode record, where the barcode with the highest average abundance was retained as the “parent” barcode sequence. Technical replicates were also merged by summing counts across replicates. Each sample was then normalized for sequencing depth by dividing the read count for each barcode in a given sample by the sum of the total reads. All further analysis and visualization was performed in R or Python.
Genomic DNA from viable tumor cells was extracted using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (QIAGEN, Cat # 69506) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Whole exome sequencing libraries were constructed and enriched from 200 ng of genomic DNA using the Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon v7 capture kit sequenced on Illumina HiSeq2500. Sequencing reads were aligned to human genome reference (build hg38) using Burrows-Wheeler aligner (BWA-MEM) ( Favero et al., 2015 22. Favero, F. ∙ Joshi, T. ∙ Marquard, A.M. ...

Li, H. ∙ Durbin, R. Fast and accurate short read alignment with Burrows-Wheeler transform Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :1754-1760 Crossref Scopus (31658) PubMed Google Scholar ). Matched tumor-normal bam files were used to call somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertions and deletions (Indels) with MuTect2 (v3.6) and copy number profiles using Varscan2 (v2.4.2) and Sequenza (v2.1.2) ( Benjamin et al., 2019 3.

Mutect2 calls were annotated and converted to maf format using vcf2maf ( https://github.com/mskcc/vcf2maf ; Cerami et al., 2012 11. Cerami, E. ∙ Gao, J. ∙ Dogrusoz, U. ... The cBio cancer genomics portal: an open platform for exploring multidimensional cancer genomics data Cancer Discov. 2012; 2 :401-404 Crossref Scopus (11221) PubMed Google Scholar ). MAF files and copy-number profiles for each sample were then input into the inferHeterogeneity() function from the maftools (v2.0.10) R package to calculate Mutant-Allele Tumor Heterogeneity (MATH) scores ( Mayakonda et al., 2018 52. Mayakonda, A. ∙ Lin, D.C. ∙ Assenov, Y. ... Maftools: efficient and comprehensive analysis of somatic variants in cancer Genome Res. 2018; 28 :1747-1756 Crossref Scopus (2294) PubMed Google Scholar ). Binomial distributions for each mutation in diploid regions of the genome were calculated using the dbinom() function in R across the full range of possible variant allele fractions (0 to 1 by 0.001 increments) as a function of depth of sequencing and alt-allele read counts. In order to test the assumptions of the t test, specifically those of normality and equal variance we performed the Shapiro-Wilk normality test and Levene’s Test of Equality of Variances, respectively. Shapiro-Wilk p value = 0.58 (group 1) and p value = 0.98 (group 2) indicating that the distribution of the data is not significantly different from a normal distribution. Two-sample Levene’s test p value = 0.27 indicated that the variances of these two groups are not significantly different.
Pairtree code was written in Python 3. Data analysis pipeline was written in Bash. See Data S1 for details on methodology and analysis.
Viably frozen CRC cells (barcoded POP66, t = 0’ sample described above) were thawed, then expanded in culture for 3 passages. Cells were then dissociated and injected as described into female NOD/SCID mice, 6 weeks of age (2 injections at 2 × 10 5 cells each; 5 mice for control group, 35 mice for CPT-11 group). When the average tumor volume reached 250 mm 3 , tumor-bearing mice were randomized into control and treatment groups based on tumor volumes, and dosing commenced on day 0. Treatment regimens were: Vehicle-DMSO (Saline + 5% DMSO control) twice per week for 1 week, or CPT-11 (45 mg/kg) twice per week for 6-7 weeks. Body weights and tumor sizes were measured every 3-4 days until mice were euthanized and tumors were harvested. Tumors were excised, pooled for the CPT-11 group (≥6 tumors per sample), and processed as described above, except that samples were digested for 30-35 minutes, then washed and filtered through a 70 μm cell strainer, and incubated in ammonium chloride solution on ice for 10 minutes.
Dissociated cells were stained and prepared for FACS as previously described with modifications. Briefly, cells were resuspended in DPBS/2% FBS to a concentration of 5 × 10 6 cells/ml. PE-conjugated antibodies for human CD326 (EpCAM; Miltenyi Cat # 130-098-118; RRID: AB_2660300 ; 1:25) and APC-conjugated antibodies for mouse H-2Kb (ThermoFisher, Cat # MA5-17998; RRID: AB_2539382 ; 1:20) were added, and cells with antibodies were aliquoted 100 μl/tube and incubated on ice for 60 minutes, protected from light. Cells were then collected by centrifugation at 400 × g for 3 minutes, washed once, then resuspended in DPBS/2% FBS with SYTOX Blue nucleic acid stain (Invitrogen, Cat # S11348), filtered, and pooled. Live human CRC cells (PE+, APC-, Sytox-) were purified by FACS using a MoFlo Astrios cell sorter (Beckman Coulter). After sorting, cells were collected by centrifugation at 450 × g for 15 minutes, then snap-frozen for subsequent RNA extraction.
RNA was extracted from FACS-purified tumor cells was using PicoPure RNA Isolation Kit (Applied Biosystems, Cat # KIT0214) following the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was extracted from spheroid cultures was using RNeasy kit (QIAGEN, Cat # 74106) following the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was quantified using NanoDrop Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). For assessment of RNA abundance in cells, cultures were treated with DMSO or CPT-11 (1 μM) for 14 days, trypsinized to single cells and counted. RNA was extracted from 5x10 5 cells of each treatment condition and the RNA concentration (per cell) was determined.
RNA sequencing libraries were prepared using Takara SMARTer Stranded Total RNA-Seq Kit v1 - Pico Input Mammalian library kit (Takara, Cat # 635007), loaded in equimolar amounts on an Illumina NextSeq500 sequencer, and sequenced to an average depth of 40M 75 base-pair paired-end reads per sample. Raw FASTQ files were examined for quality using MultiQC (v1.6; Ewels et al., 2016 21. Ewels, P. ∙ Magnusson, M. ∙ Lundin, S. ... MultiQC: summarize analysis results for multiple tools and samples in a single report Bioinformatics. 2016; 32 :3047-3048 Crossref Scopus (3357) PubMed Google Scholar ) and pre-processed to remove any reads shorter than 36bp using a bespoke Perl script. Due to potential contamination from mouse stroma, reads were first were mapped to Gencode v25 transcript models and hg38 human genome sequence using the STAR short-read aligner (v.2.4.2a; Dobin et al., 2013 16. Dobin, A. ∙ Davis, C.A. ∙ Schlesinger, F. ... STAR: ultrafast universal RNA-seq aligner Bioinformatics. 2013; 29 :15-21 Crossref Scopus (25615) PubMed Google Scholar ), and separately against mouse transcript models (Gencode vM12, mm10). Adaptor trimming was included using the following argument for STAR:–clip3pAdapterSeq AGATCGGAAGAGC. Next, the aligned BAM files generated for each sample were filtered using the R package XenofilteR (v.0.99; Kluin et al., 2018 41. Kluin, R.J.C. ∙ Kemper, K. ∙ Kuilman, T. ... XenofilteR: computational deconvolution of mouse and human reads in tumor xenograft sequence data BMC Bioinformatics. 2018; 19 :366 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ) to flag and remove reads of mouse origin. Finally, the filtered BAM files were summarized to gene-level read counts using HTSeq (v.0.6.1) with the following options: -f bam -r pos -s reverse -t gene < BAM file >. All read count files were merged together into a matrix for further analysis.
Count data were subsequently imported into R (v.3.5.0) and filtered to remove non-expressed genes. For read-depth normalization, filtered gene count data were analyzed with the limma using the edgeR package v.3.24.0 in R (see Tables S3 and S4 ; McCarthy et al., 2012 53. McCarthy, D.J. ∙ Chen, Y. ∙ Smyth, G.K.

Thresholds for differential expression were fold-change > 1.5 and FDR < 0.05. Gene ontology analysis was performed with David 6.7 ( https://david-d.ncifcrf.gov/ ) ( Huang et al., 2009a 36.

Other RNA-seq analyses and statistics were performed in R utilizing custom R scripts. Control samples noted in Figure 4 are DMSO and Saline treated tumors.
RNA-seq data from ESCs (control and paused) ( Bulut-Karslioglu et al., 2016 8. Bulut-Karslioglu, A. ∙ Biechele, S. ∙ Jin, H. ... Inhibition of mTOR induces a paused pluripotent state Nature. 2016; 540 :119-123 Crossref Scopus (163) PubMed Google Scholar ) and embryos (control E4.5 and diapause) ( Boroviak et al., 2015 5. Boroviak, T. ∙ Loos, R. ∙ Lombard, P. ... Lineage-Specific Profiling Delineates the Emergence and Progression of Naive Pluripotency in Mammalian Embryogenesis Dev. Cell. 2015; 35 :366-382 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (298) PubMed Google Scholar ) were also filtered to remove non-expressed genes, read-depth normalized and analyzed with limma using the “edgeR” package in R. For direct comparison with tumor expression data, normalized gene expression counts were first transformed into z-scores separately for each dataset before merging the data. Genes with matching nomenclature were considered as orthologs (see Table S4 ). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed with the prcomp function using the z-scores (normalized within each dataset) and plotted with the function xyplot in R. Hierachical clustering of tumors and embryos was performed with the “ward.D” method of the hclust function in R using the z-scores (normalized within each dataset).
For gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), gene signatures were obtained from the MSigDB “Hallmark gene sets” collection ( Liberzon et al., 2015 51. Liberzon, A. ∙ Birger, C. ∙ Thorvaldsdóttir, H. ... The Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) hallmark gene set collection Cell Syst. 2015; 1 :417-425 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (5944) PubMed Google Scholar ). All expressed genes were pre-ranked by t value (DTP state/control, or resistant tumors/control, performed with edgeR as previously described). GSEA analysis was then performed using the fGSEA package ( Korotkevich et al., 2019 43. Korotkevich, G. ∙ Sukhov, V. ∙ Sergushichev, A. Fast gene set enrichment analysis bioRxiv. 2019; Crossref Google Scholar ). The full list of Hallmark pathways is provided in Table S5 . For comparison purposes, a literature search was also performed on NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ ) to acquire expression data from models of low proliferation, with a focus on cell cycle arrest, and the following models were selected: ESCs grown in MEK/GSK inhibitor-containing “2i” media, Nutlin3a-treated HCT116 colon cancer cells and neural crest cells, palbociclib (CDK4/6 inhibitor)-treated DLD1 colon cancer cells, spontaneous p21-arrested human mammary epithelial cell line MCF10A, and Rb overexpression-arrested ESCs. GEO accession numbers: GSE81285 , GSE113682 , GSE128191 , GSE74603 , GSE122927 and GSE29783 ( Bulut-Karslioglu et al., 2016 8. Bulut-Karslioglu, A. ∙ Biechele, S. ∙ Jin, H. ...

Conklin, J.F. ∙ Baker, J. ∙ Sage, J. The RB family is required for the self-renewal and survival of human embryonic stem cells Nat. Commun. 2012; 3 :1244 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ). For each model of cell cycle arrest, as well as the embryonic pausing models (paused ESCs and diapaused embryos), differential analysis and GSEA were performed as previously described for the DTP state. Then, the normalized enrichment scores (NES) for all models were merged. In order to focus on relevant pathways and avoid issues linked to the non-continuous distribution of the NES, scores with FDR > 0.05 were ignored and replaced by missing values (NAs). The data were then plotted as a heatmap, using the “ward.D” method of the hclust function for clustering purposes, with missing values colored in gray.
For direct comparison of the DTP state and paused ESCs by GSEA, the top differentially expressed genes in paused ESCs (t > 10 or t < −10, as computed with edgeR) were selected as gene lists. Then, all expressed genes were pre-ranked by t value for the DTP state and GSEA analysis was performed using the fGSEA package ( Korotkevich et al., 2019 43. Korotkevich, G. ∙ Sukhov, V. ∙ Sergushichev, A. Fast gene set enrichment analysis bioRxiv. 2019; Crossref Google Scholar ).
To establish a general “embryonic pausing signature,” differential expression was first measured in each embryonic model independently (i.e., paused ESC/control ESC and diapaused embryos/E4.5 embryos). Genes significantly dysregulated in both models (upregulated in both or downregulated in both, with FDR < 0.05 for each model, as computed with edgeR) were selected for the signature (see Table S6 ). Then, the expression value (z-score) was multiplied by −1 if the gene was downregulated in the embryonic models, while the value of genes upregulated in the embryonic models was kept unchanged, so that a positive expression value would always reflect a change similar to embryonic pausing. For each sample, the signature score was then computed as the mean of all genes. The same method was applied to datasets related to MRD, obtained from the NCBI GEO database (GSE83142, GSE102124 and GSE116237) ( Ebinger et al., 2016 18. Ebinger, S. ∙ Özdemir, E.Z. ∙ Ziegenhain, C. ...

When needed, gene ID conversion was performed using bioDBnet ( https://biodbnet-abcc.ncifcrf.gov/db/db2db.php ; Mudunuri et al., 2009 56. Mudunuri, U. ∙ Che, A. ∙ Yi, M. ... bioDBnet: the biological database network Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :555-556 Crossref Scopus (250) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Gene signatures for the “mTORC1 response” and the “Myc response” were obtained from the MSigDB “Hallmark gene sets” collection ( Liberzon et al., 2015 51. Liberzon, A. ∙ Birger, C. ∙ Thorvaldsdóttir, H. ... The Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) hallmark gene set collection Cell Syst. 2015; 1 :417-425 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (5944) PubMed Google Scholar ). For each sample, the score was computed as the average expression z-score of all signature genes. The list of “diapause-related autophagy genes” was obtained from He 2019 ( He et al., 2019 34. He, B. ∙ Zhang, H. ∙ Wang, J. ... Blastocyst activation engenders transcriptome reprogram affecting X-chromosome reactivation and inflammatory trigger of implantation Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2019; 116 :16621-16630 Crossref Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ).
For the survival analysis, we utilized The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) CRC cohort ( Cancer Genome Atlas, 2012 9. Cancer Genome Atlas, N., Cancer Genome Atlas Network Comprehensive molecular characterization of human colon and rectal cancer Nature. 2012; 487 :330-337 Crossref Scopus (6404) PubMed Google Scholar ). Gene expression (RSEM z-scores) and overall survival information was retrieved from the “Firehose” portal ( https://gdac.broadinstitute.org/ ) for colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) and rectal adenocarcinoma (READ), and merged (COREAD). Embryonic pausing signature score was computed for each sample by using differentially expressed genes. As described in the previous section, first the expression value of each gene (z-score) was multiplied by its sign from the differential gene expression analysis (−1 for downregulated, +1 for upregulated genes). Next, the embryonic pausing signature was computed by averaging the values. To determine the cut-off between high and low expression, all percentiles were computed, and the best-performing threshold (in terms of the p value for the corresponding observation, regardless of the direction of the change) between the two groups was selected as the cut-off. We then applied the Kaplan-Meier model and log rank test was used to determine the p value.
For autophagy, the gene signature was obtained from “GO_REGULATION_OF_AUTOPHAGY” from the Gene Ontology Consortium (GO:0010506). The autophagy signature score was computed with the same method as previously described for the pausing signature, with the exception that z-scores were not multiplied by +1/-1. Kaplan-Meier model and log rank test were then used to evaluate the effects of autophagy on survival in the CRC cohort (COREAD). We applied the same method to other TCGA cohorts to identify cancer types in which autophagy was associated with poor survival.
CRC cells were treated in vitro with the chemotherapies at these indicated doses: CPT-11 (1 μM), INK 128 (25 nM), SBI-0206965 (2.5 μM) and Chloroquine (20 μM).
For cell growth analysis by counting, cells were plated in multiple T25 flasks (0.5x10 6 cells for POP66 and CSC28; 1x10 6 for POP92 and HT29) in 7 mL of medium and treated with DMSO (vehicle control), CPT-11 (1 μM), INK 128 (25 nM), SBI-0206965 (2.5 μM) or combination (CPT-11+SBI-0206965) at the indicated treatment concentrations. Cells were treated twice a week for the indicated durations. To count, cells from 1 flask of each indicated treatment were dissociated and counted manually using a hemocytometer after trypan blue exclusion. All cells under treatment were subjected to brief trypsinization every 7-10 days to maintain spheroid growth in logarithmic phase.
CRC cultures were labeled with Vybrant DiD (Molecular Probes, Cat # MP22887) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Labeled samples were treated with either DMSO or CPT-11 (1 μM) for 14 days (2 times per week). At days 0, 7 and 14 on treatment, and day 24 (10 days post-treatment cessation), cultures were dissociated, labeled with SYTOX Blue nucleic acid stain (Invitrogen, Cat # S11348) and were assessed for the degree of Vybrant DiD staining present within each sample. Cytofluorimetric analysis of treated cultures post-DiD staining was done on the BD LSR-II (BD Biosciences). Cells were initially gated for live cell population (sytox negative stained cells) and then for Vybrant DiD-negative (DiD-) and DiD-positive (DiD+) cells. Negative control samples were cells that were not labeled with Vybrant DiD and were used to set the gate to detect DiD− events. Subsequently, post-labeling treated cells that were in this DiD− gate were determined to have entirely lost their initial label. Cells not found in this gate were determined to be positive for Vybrant DiD dye label. Percentage of cells found in each gate was determined at the indicated time points using FlowJo software (version 10) and statistical analysis was performed using the GraphPad Prism software (version 6).

Cultures were pelleted, washed with ice-cold PBS and then lysed in RIPA buffer (Thermo Fisher, Cat # 89900) supplemented with protease/phosphatase inhibitors (Cell Signaling, Cat # 5872) for 15 minutes at 4°C. Samples were then sonicated in a Q800 Waterbath sonicator (QSonica) for 15 cycles of 8 s ON, 15 s OFF. Lysates were cleared after centrifugation at 16000 x g for 15 min, protein concentration was determined using Pierce BCA Protein Assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat # 23225) and lysates were then boiled in Laemmli buffer for 5 minutes (Bio-Rad, Cat # 1610747). Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (Bio-Rad, Cat # 456-1094) and transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore, Cat # IPFL00010).

For cell cycle analysis, cells were treated for 14 days with DMSO, CPT-11 (1 μM), trypsinized, washed and fixed in ice-cold ethanol overnight. Cells were then washed with PBS twice and resuspended in FxCycle Violet (Invitrogen, Cat # F10347) following the manufacturer’s instructions. For apoptosis/necrosis analysis, Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide (PI) staining (Annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection kit, Thermo Fisher, Cat # 88-8005-72) was performed following the manufacturer’s instructions. For both assays, cells were analyzed on BD LSR-II (BD Biosciences). Data was analyzed with FlowJo v10.
Here we describe the quantitative analysis of clonal response of lentiviral barcoded human CRC xenografts to chemotherapy treatment. Our goal is to infer rules of cancer cell dynamics leading to the observed heterogeneity in clonal output of individual cells. The central question we address is: Does clonal heterogeneity come from (a) “selective dynamics” from fitness difference among clones, or (b) from the stochastic dynamics of an “equipotent” population of tumorogeneic cells? We find that the experimental data is consistent with an equipotent scenario, and the shape of the barcode frequency distribution can be explained by a model with proliferative hierarchy ( Goyal et al., 2015 27.

West, J. ∙ Newton, P.K. Cellular interactions constrain tumor growth Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2019; 116 :1918-1923 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To get a quantitative understanding of clonal dynamics during tumor growth we analyzed the barcode frequency distribution obtained from the experiments. Here, we show that the barcode frequency distribution exhibits a log-linear relationship, i.e., a linear relationship on a log-log plot: 𝑝 ⁡ ( 𝑛 ) ∼ 𝑛 − ( 1 + 𝛼 ) . We estimated the value of 𝛼 using maximum likelihood estimation ( Clauset et al., 2009 13. Clauset, A. ∙ Shalizi, C.R. ∙ Newman, M.E.J. Power-Law Distributions in Empirical Data SIAM Rev. 2009; 51 :661-703 Crossref Scopus (6307) Google Scholar ). In agreement with the maximum likelihood estimates of 𝛼 , the corresponding cumulative distribution 𝑄 ⁡ ( 𝑛 ) = ∑ 𝑛 ′ > 𝑛 𝑝 ⁡ ( 𝑛 ′ ) ∼ 𝑛 − 𝛼 also exhibits a log-linear relationship (see Figures 3 and S5 ).
Cellular interactions are thought to constrain tumor growth, causing an initially exponentially growing tumor to slow down and exhibit power law growth kinetics ( West and Newton, 2019 77. West, J. ∙ Newton, P.K. Cellular interactions constrain tumor growth Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2019; 116 :1918-1923 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ). If cancer growth kinetics follow power law kinetics, i.e., ˙ 𝑛 = 𝑛 1 − 𝛼 + 𝜃 ⁢ 𝐶 , where 𝛼 quantifies the interaction between dividing cells, 𝜃 is the rate for a particular clone to transition to rapidly cycling state, and 𝐶 is total number of progenitor like engrafted cells each with a unique barcode, then the population size at long times grows polynomially, 𝑛 ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) ∼ ( 𝛼 ⁢ 𝑡 ) 1 / 𝛼 . Now, for the 𝑖 𝑡 ⁢ ℎ clone, its size 𝑐 𝑖 follows mean-field kinetics given by, ˙ 𝑐 = 𝑐 / 𝑛 𝛼 = 𝑐 / 𝛼 ⁢ 𝑡 , giving 𝑐 ⁢ ( 𝑇 − 𝑡 ) = ( 𝑇 / 𝑡 ) 1 / 𝛼 . Assuming independent and stochastic entry of each clone, the probability distribution for a clone to get to a particular size is, 𝑝 ⁡ ( 𝑛 , 𝑇 ) ≈ ∫ 𝑇 0 𝑑 𝑡 ⁢ 𝜃 ⁢ 𝑒 − 𝜃 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝛿 ⁢ ( 𝑛 − 𝑐 ⁢ ( 𝑇 − 𝑡 ) ) . Although, this integral ignores the stochasticity in the birth-death process of the fast-cycling cells, it still highlights the source of the log-linear relationship. The integral is readily evaluated via a change of variables 𝑦 = 𝑐 ⁢ ( 𝑇 − 𝑡 ) leading to 𝑡 = 𝑇 ⁢ 𝑦 − 𝛼 , giving 𝑝 ⁡ ( 𝑛 , 𝑇 ) ∼ ∫ 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑦 ⁢ 𝑦 − ( 1 + 𝛼 ) ⁢ 𝛿 ⁢ ( 𝑛 − 𝑦 ) ∼ 𝑛 − ( 1 + 𝛼 ) for large clones.
To understand how selective dynamics leads to log-linear distribution, let us consider clones with heterogeneous rates of proliferation. For a clone 𝑖 undergoing a stochastic birth-death process its clone size distribution is given by 𝑝 𝑖 ⁡ ( 𝑛 ) = 𝜆 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑒 − 𝑛 ⁢ 𝜆 𝑖 where 𝜆 𝑖 depends on its proliferative capacity and time. If we assume a generic Gamma distribution for the heterogeneity for 𝜆 , i.e., 𝑝 ⁡ ( 𝜆 ) = 𝑎 𝑏 ⁢ 𝑒 − 𝑏 ⁢ 𝜆 ⁢ 𝜆 𝑎 − 1 / 𝛤 ⁡ ( 𝑎 ) , the overall clone size distribution is given by 𝑝 ⁡ ( 𝑛 ) = ∫ 𝑑 𝜆 𝜆 𝑒 − 𝑛 ⁢ 𝜆 ⁢ ⁢ ⁢ 𝑝 ⁡ ( 𝜆 ) = 𝑎 / 𝑏 ( 𝑛 / 𝑏 + 1 ) 1 + 𝑎 , which asymptotically behaves in a log-linear fashion, 𝑝 ⁡ ( 𝑛 ) ∼ 𝑛 − ( 1 + 𝑎 ) .
Here we present derivation of different models that provide the basis for the heuristic analysis presented above. (i) No proliferative hierarchy – Let 𝑟 be the birth-rate of an injected cell and 𝜇 be its death rate. The outcome of such a process is summarized into a distribution of tumor having 𝑛 cells at time 𝑡 starting from one cell. 𝑝 ⁡ ( 𝑛 , 𝑡 | ⁢ 1 , 0 ) = ( 1 − 𝑝 𝑆 ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) ) ⁢ 𝛿 𝑛 , 0 + 𝑝 𝑆 ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) ⁢ ( 1 − 𝑎 ) 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑎 𝑛 ⁢ ( 1 − 𝛿 𝑛 , 0 ) #(1) where 𝑎 = ( 𝐴 1 − 1 ) / ( 𝐴 1 − 𝜈 0 ) and 𝑝 𝑆 = 𝐴 1 ⁢ ( 1 − 𝜈 0 ) / ( 𝐴 1 − 𝜈 0 ) where 𝐴 1 = 𝑒 ( 𝑟 − 𝜇 ) ⁢ 𝑡 and 𝜈 0 = 𝜇 / 𝑟 . (ii) Proliferative hierarchy: If there is a proliferative hierarchy, to calculate the distribution of having 𝑛 number of cells starting with one injected cell, 𝑃 ⁡ ( 𝑛 , 𝑇 | ⁢ 1 ) is given by a combination of three mutually exclusive processes: (i) the tumor dies that is 𝑛 = 0 if the first event for the initial starting cell is death, i.e., ∫ 𝑇 0 𝑒 − ( 𝜃 + 𝜇 ) ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝜇 𝑑 𝑡 , (ii) nothing happens, and (iii) the first event is differentiation after which growth of progenitor cell controls the fate of the tumor, 𝑃 + ⁡ ( 𝑛 , 𝑇 | ⁢ 1 ) ; these three contributions are mutually exclusive and are separated in Equation 2 for clarity. Here 𝜃 is the transition rate between the states. 𝑃 ⁡ ( 𝑛 , 𝑇 | ⁢ 1 ) = ( 1 − 𝑝 𝑆 ) ⁢ ( 1 − 𝑒 − ( 𝜃 + 𝜇 ) ⁢ 𝑇 ) ⁢ 𝛿 𝑛 , 0 ⏟ _ ⏟ _ ⏟ Ι + 𝑒 − ( 𝛼 + 𝜇 ) ⁢ 𝑇 ⁢ 𝛿 𝑛 , 1 ⏟ _ ⏟ _ ⏟ Ι Ι + 𝑇 ∫ 0 𝑒 − ( 𝜃 + 𝜇 ) ⁢ 𝑡 × ( 𝜃 ⁢ 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑡 ) × ( 𝑒 − 𝑟 ⁢ ( 𝑇 − 𝑡 ) ⁢ ( 1 − 𝑒 − 𝑟 ⁢ ( 𝑇 − 𝑡 ) ) 𝑛 − 1 ) ⏟ _ ⏟ _ ⏟ Ι Ι Ι #(2) The non-trivial term when the first event is differentiation can be calculated readily: 𝑃 + ⁡ ( 𝑛 , 𝑇 | 1 ) = 𝜃 ⁢ 𝑇 ∫ 0 𝑑 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑒 − ( 𝜃 + 𝜇 ) ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑒 − 𝑟 ⁢ ( 𝑇 − 𝑡 ) ⁢ ( 1 − 𝑒 − 𝑟 ⁢ ( 𝑇 − 𝑡 ) ) 𝑛 − 1 #(3) = 𝜃 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑒 − ( 𝜃 + 𝜇 ) ⁢ 𝑇 ⁢ 1 − 𝐴 − 1 ∫ 0 𝑑 𝑦 ⁢ 𝑦 𝑛 − 1 ( 1 − 𝑦 ) 𝜈 #(4) = 𝜃 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑒 − ( 𝜃 + 𝜇 ) ⁢ 𝑇 ⁢ 𝐵 ⁡ ( 𝐴 ; 𝜈 , 𝑛 − 1 ) #(5) where 𝜈 ≡ ( 𝜃 + 𝜇 ) / 𝑟 and 𝐴 = 𝑒 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑇 .
Let us evaluate 𝐵 ⁡ ( 𝐴 ; 𝜈 , 𝑛 ) for large 𝐴 and 𝑛 > 0 and 𝜈 ≠ 1 using integration by parts. 𝐵 ⁡ ( 𝐴 ; 𝜈 , 𝑛 ) = 1 − 1 / 𝐴 ∫ 0 𝑑 𝑦 ⁢ 𝑦 𝑛 ⁢ ( 1 − 𝑦 ) − 𝜈 #(6) = − 𝑦 𝑛 ⁢ ( 1 − 𝑦 ) − 𝜈 + 1 1 − 𝜈 ∣ 1 − 1 / 𝐴 0 + 𝑛 1 − 𝜈 ⁢ ∫ 𝑑 𝑦 ⁢ 𝑦 𝑛 − 1 ⁢ ( 1 − 𝑦 ) − 𝜈 + 1 #(7) = − ( 1 − 1 / 𝐴 ) 𝑛 ⁢ 𝐴 𝜈 − 1 1 − 𝜈 + 𝑛 1 − 𝜈 ⁢ 𝐵 ⁡ ( 𝐴 ; 𝜈 − 1 , 𝑛 − 1 ) #(8) Recursion gives, 𝐵 ⁡ ( 𝐴 ; 𝜈 , 𝑛 ) = − ∑ 𝑛 𝑘 = 0 ( 1 − 1 / 𝐴 ) 𝑛 − 𝑘 ⁢ 𝐴 𝜈 − 𝑘 − 1 ⁢ Γ ⁢ ( 𝑛 + 1 ) Γ ⁢ ( 𝑛 − 𝑘 + 1 ) ⁢ Γ ⁢ ( 1 − 𝜈 ) Γ ⁢ ( 𝑘 + 2 − 𝜈 ) + Γ ⁢ ( 𝑛 + 1 ) ⁢ Γ ⁢ ( 1 − 𝜈 ) Γ ⁢ ( 𝑛 + 1 − 𝜈 ) ⁢ 𝐵 ⁡ ( 𝐴 ; 𝜈 − 𝑛 , 0 ) #(9) Finally giving, 𝐵 ⁡ ( 𝐴 ; 𝜈 , 𝑛 ) = − ∑ 𝑛 𝑘 = 0 ( 1 − 1 / 𝐴 ) 𝑛 − 𝑘 ⁢ 𝐴 𝜈 − 𝑘 − 1 ⁢ Γ ⁢ ( 𝑛 + 1 ) Γ ⁢ ( 𝑛 − 𝑘 + 1 ) ⁢ Γ ⁢ ( 1 − 𝜈 ) Γ ⁢ ( 𝑘 + 2 − 𝜈 ) + Γ ⁢ ( 𝑛 + 1 ) ⁢ Γ ⁢ ( 1 − 𝜈 ) Γ ⁢ ( 𝑛 + 2 − 𝜈 ) ⁢ ( 1 − 𝐴 𝜈 − 𝑛 − 1 ) #(10) An asymptotic approximation for 𝑛 ≫ 1 and 𝐴 → ∞ is given by 𝑃 ⁡ ( 𝑛 , 𝑇 | ⁢ 1 ) ≈ ( 1 − 𝑝 𝑆 ) ⁢ ( 1 − 𝑒 − ( 𝛼 + 𝜇 ) ⁢ 𝑇 ) ⁢ 𝛿 𝑛 , 0 + 𝑒 − ( 𝛼 + 𝜇 ) ⁢ 𝑇 ⁢ 𝛿 𝑛 , 1 + 𝑒 − ( 𝛼 + 𝜇 ) ⁢ 𝑇 ⁢ 𝑝 𝑆 ⁢ 𝜈 ⁢ 1 𝑛 1 − 𝜈 ⁢ ( 1 − 𝛿 𝑛 , 0 ) #(11) Note that the probability distribution for large 𝑛 behaves as 𝑛 − ( 1 − 𝜈 ) , which is what we observe for the T0 distribution, indicated by the negative slope in Figures 3 C and 3D.
If we assume crowding reduces the growth in a population dependent way, then we can assume the growth rate to be 𝑟 / 𝑛 𝛼 , where 𝑛 ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) satisfies equation ˙ 𝑛 = 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑛 1 − 𝛼 , and solves to 𝑛 ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) = ( 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝛼 + 1 ) 1 / 𝛼 . Now for a birth process with 𝑟 / 𝑛 𝛼 as the time dependent birth rate, 𝑝 ⁡ ( 𝑛 , 𝑇 | ⁢ 1 , 𝑡 ) = 𝑒 − 𝑅 ⁡ ( 𝑡 , 𝑇 ) ⁢ ( 1 − 𝑒 − 𝑅 ⁡ ( 𝑡 , 𝑇 ) ) 𝑛 − 1 , where 𝑅 ⁡ ( 𝑡 , 𝑇 ) = 𝑇 ∫ 𝑡 𝑟 / 𝑛 ⁢ ( 𝑡 ′ ) 𝛼 ⁢ 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑡 ′ = l o g ⁡ ( ( 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑇 ⁢ 𝛼 + 1 ) / ( 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝛼 + 1 ) ) 1 𝛼 .
Putting this together for proliferative hierarchy with crowding model, we get for 𝑛 ≫ 1 𝑃 ⁡ ( 𝑛 , 𝑇 | 1 , 0 ) = 𝑇 ∫ 0 𝑑 𝑡 ⁢ 𝜃 ⁢ 𝑒 − ( 𝜃 + 𝜇 ) ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑒 − 𝑅 ⁡ ( 𝑡 , 𝑇 ) ⁢ ( 1 − 𝑒 − 𝑅 ⁡ ( 𝑡 , 𝑇 ) ) 𝑛 − 1 #(12) ∼ 1 − 1 / 𝐴 ∫ 0 𝑑 𝑦 ⁢ 𝑒 − ( 𝜃 + 𝜇 ) ⁢ 𝑇 ⁢ ( 1 − 𝑦 ) 𝛼 ⁢ 𝑦 𝑛 − 1 ( 1 − 𝑦 ) − 𝛼 #(13) ∼ 𝐵 ⁡ ( 𝐴 ; − 𝛼 , 𝑛 − 1 ) #(14) which behaves as 𝑛 − ( 1 + 𝛼 ) . Hence, the cumulative distribution behaves as 𝑛 − 𝛼 .
We performed stochastic simulations using Gillespie algorithm ( Gillespie, 1977 26. Gillespie, D.T. Exact stochastic simulation of coupled chemical reactions J. Phys. Chem. 1977; 81 :2340-2361 Crossref Scopus (7536) Google Scholar ) to test the validity of our mathematical analysis ( https://github.com/smcgibbo/Gillispie-Simulations ). With the aim to understand the role of power law kinetics on clone size distribution, we assume mean size of tumor to follow 𝑛 ⁡ ( 𝑇 ) ∼ 𝑇 1 / 𝛼 , and assume growth rate of a clone to be proportional to 1 / 𝑛 ⁢ ( 𝑡 ) 𝛼 , such that the mean-field dynamics of each clone follows ˙ 𝑐 𝑖 ∼ 𝑐 𝑖 / 𝑛 ⁢ ( 𝑡 ) 𝛼 . The cumulative distributions obtained from the simulation (model figure, below), agrees quantitatively with the mathematical analysis and shows a log-linear relationship for clone size distribution. Here we have focused on early time population dynamics where a tumor’s net growth is dominated by power law kinetics. At longer times, as tumor progresses, the steady state distribution of clones will depend on the tumor’s long-term birth and death kinetics. The model figure depicts time evolution of cumulative distributions obtained from simulation of 1 0 5 clones with growth kinetics characterized by power law with (A) 𝛼 = 0 . 3 , (B) 𝛼 = 0 . 5 , and (C) 𝛼 = 0 . 7 . Time is measured in number of generations and the solid line shows the slope of 𝛼 on the log-log plot. Figure viewer Model Figure: Cumulative Distributions of Simulated Power Law Growth Kinetics
All the statistical details of experiments can be found in the figure legends, including the significance computed, statistical test used, and number of independent experiments performed for each assay (n). The results of quantitative data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD) or standard error of mean (SEM), as indicated.
Statistical analyses were performed as indicated with each assay in the Method Details section. Statistical differences between data pairs were analyzed by Student’s t test. For multiple comparisons, one-way or two-way ANOVA was used, as indicated. For barcode composition analysis, Wilcoxon rank-sum test with Holm multiple testing correction was used. For Kaplan-Meier analysis, the log rank test was used. Differences were considered statistically significant when p < 0.05. Significance thresholds for differential gene expression or pathway analyses were FDR < 0.05.
For MATH score analysis, to test the assumptions of the t test, specifically those of normality and equal variance, we performed the Shapiro-Wilk normality test and Levene’s Test of Equality of Variances, respectively. Shapiro-Wilk p value = 0.58 (group 1) and p value = 0.98 (group 2) indicating that the distribution of the data is not significantly different from a normal distribution. Two-sample Levene’s test p value = 0.27 indicated that the variances of these two groups are not significantly different.
