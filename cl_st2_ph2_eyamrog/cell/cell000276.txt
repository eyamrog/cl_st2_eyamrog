Title: TMEM41B Is a Pan-flavivirus Host Factor


Abstract: Summary

Flaviviruses pose a constant threat to human health. These RNA viruses are transmitted by the bite of infected mosquitoes and ticks and regularly cause outbreaks. To identify host factors required for flavivirus infection, we performed full-genome loss of function CRISPR-Cas9 screens. Based on these results, we focused our efforts on characterizing the roles that TMEM41B and VMP1 play in the virus replication cycle. Our mechanistic studies on TMEM41B revealed that all members of the Flaviviridae family that we tested require TMEM41B. We tested 12 additional virus families and found that SARS-CoV-2 of the Coronaviridae also required TMEM41B for infection. Remarkably, single nucleotide polymorphisms present at nearly 20% in East Asian populations reduce flavivirus infection. Based on our mechanistic studies, we propose that TMEM41B is recruited to flavivirus RNA replication complexes to facilitate membrane curvature, which creates a protected environment for viral genome replication.

Section: Introduction

Virus outbreaks are a regular yet unpredictable feature of an interconnected world. Flaviviruses are known to cause outbreaks worldwide and are transmitted primarily by the bite of infected mosquitoes and ticks.
Flaviviruses, members of the Flaviviridae family, are positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses that have caused several notable outbreaks in recent history. For example, West Nile virus (WNV) emerged in New York City in 1999, spread across the continent, and is now endemic in the United States ( Kramer et al., 2019 33. Kramer, L.D. ∙ Ciota, A.T. ∙ Kilpatrick, A.M. Introduction, Spread, and Establishment of West Nile Virus in the Americas J. Med. Entomol. 2019; 56 :1448-1455 Crossref Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ; Roehrig et al., 2002 57. Roehrig, J.T. ∙ Layton, M. ∙ Smith, P. ... The emergence of West Nile virus in North America: ecology, epidemiology, and surveillance Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2002; 267 :223-240 PubMed Google Scholar ). Also noteworthy are the recurring yellow fever virus (YFV) outbreaks that occur in sub-Saharan Africa and South America despite the availability of a highly effective vaccine ( Ahmed and Memish, 2017 1. Ahmed, Q.A. ∙ Memish, Z.A. Yellow fever from Angola and Congo: a storm gathers Trop. Doct. 2017; 47 :92-96 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ; WHO, 2017 83. WHO Yellow fever in Africa and the Americas, 2016 Wkly Epidemiol Rec. 2017; 92 :442-452 PubMed Google Scholar ). Most recently, the 2016 Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic swept through South and Central America wreaking havoc on scores of unborn children by causing microcephaly in utero ( Hills et al., 2017 23.

Lee, C.Y. ∙ Ng, L.F.P. Zika virus: from an obscurity to a priority Microbes Infect. 2018; 20 :635-645 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition to these outbreaks, Aedes albopictus , a vector for ZIKV and dengue virus (DENV) has been found consistently in recent years in central Europe ( Müller et al., 2020 47. Müller, P. ∙ Engeler, L. ∙ Vavassori, L. ... Surveillance of invasive Aedes mosquitoes along Swiss traffic axes reveals different dispersal modes for Aedes albopictus and Ae. japonicus PLoS Negl. Trop. Dis. 2020; 14 :e0008705 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ), and the prevalence of tick-borne diseases is at a record high. These alarming trends correlate with warming temperatures due to climate change, which expand the range of mosquitoes and ticks ( Brady and Hay, 2020 6. Brady, O.J. ∙ Hay, S.I.

These recent flavivirus outbreaks add to the constant burden of endemic DENV transmission and underscore the devastating impacts that flaviviruses have on human health.
For many viruses with the potential to cause outbreaks, there are no specific treatments. In instances where antiviral therapies do exist, they are often virus specific. One strategy to prepare for and respond to viral outbreaks is to develop drugs that target host factors that viruses require to complete their replication cycles. CRISPR-Cas9 gene disruption has been used to identify host factors required for virus infection and nominate candidate drug targets. We, like others, set out to identify factors required for ZIKV as well as other flaviviruses with a genome-wide loss of function CRISPR-Cas9 screening approach. Here, we present our results and detailed studies focused on two genes, transmembrane protein 41B ( TMEM41B) and vacuole membrane protein 1 ( VMP1 ), that were enriched in our screens.

Section: Results

To identify host factors required for ZIKV and YFV, we performed pooled genome-wide CRISPR knockout (KO) screens in B3GALT6-deficient human haploid (HAP1) cells with ZIKV (PRVABC59 strain) and YFV (Asibi strain). The readout for these screens was cell survival. We used B3GALT6 KO cells aiming to decrease cellular heparan sulfate (HS) protein glycosylation, which has been shown to nonspecifically facilitate virus binding and subsequent entry ( Cagno et al., 2019 8. Cagno, V. ∙ Tseligka, E.D. ∙ Jones, S.T. ... Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycans and Viral Attachment: True Receptors or Adaptation Bias? Viruses. 2019; 11 :596 Crossref Scopus (240) PubMed Google Scholar ). We hypothesized that this alteration in surface protein glycosylation would decrease the enrichment and overabundance of hits related to HS protein glycosylation and nonspecific virus binding. Nevertheless, consistent with a wide range of virus-selected genome-wide loss-of-function screens ( Hoffmann et al., 2017 24. Hoffmann, H.H. ∙ Schneider, W.M. ∙ Blomen, V.A. ...

Like other flavivirus host factor screens, we identified genes that are involved in oligosaccharide transfer and genes involved in protein translocation and folding into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) ( Figure 1 A) ( Marceau et al., 2016 38.

Outside of these categories, TMEM41B was enriched in both ZIKV and YFV screens. While several of the abovementioned pathways have been studied in the context of flavivirus infection ( Marceau et al., 2016 38. Marceau, C.D. ∙ Puschnik, A.S. ∙ Majzoub, K. ...

A CRISPR screen defines a signal peptide processing pathway required by flaviviruses Nature. 2016; 535 :164-168 Crossref Scopus (273) PubMed Google Scholar ), little is known about the cellular function of TMEM41B or its role in flavivirus infection. TMEM41B was previously found to be required for synaptic transmission in motor circuit neurons ( Imlach et al., 2012 25. Imlach, W.L. ∙ Beck, E.S. ∙ Choi, B.J. ...

CRISPR screening using an expanded toolkit of autophagy reporters identifies TMEM41B as a novel autophagy factor PLoS Biol. 2019; 17 :e2007044 Crossref Scopus (91) PubMed Google Scholar ). These groups went on to show that TMEM41B is functionally similar to VMP1, which is known to have a role in lipid mobilization and autophagy ( Morishita et al., 2019 45.

There are numerous, sometimes conflicting reports, which indicate that autophagy-related genes can promote or restrict Flaviviridae infection. This literature has been recently reviewed by Po-Yuan Ke ( Ke, 2018 31. Ke, P.Y. The Multifaceted Roles of Autophagy in Flavivirus-Host Interactions Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2018; 19 :3940 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our identification of TMEM41B prompted us to interrogate our screen data further for genes involved in autophagy. Of a list of genes with an established role in autophagy, only TMEM41B and VMP1 , which act at the early stage of autophagy, scored positively ( Figure 1 B). This list, however, is not comprehensive, and therefore we next compared our ZIKV screen results to those from a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen that was designed to identify novel genes required for autophagy ( Moretti et al., 2018 44. Moretti, F. ∙ Bergman, P. ∙ Dodgson, S. ... TMEM41B is a novel regulator of autophagy and lipid mobilization EMBO Rep. 2018; 19 :e45889 Crossref Scopus (110) PubMed Google Scholar ). As shown in Figure 1 C, these two screens showed no overlap with the exception of two genes: TMEM41B and VMP1 .
TMEM41B and VMP1 are multipass transmembrane proteins that share a stretch of amino acids recently named the VTT domain based on homology among VMP1, TMEM41A/B, and TMEM64 ( Morita et al., 2019 46. Morita, K. ∙ Hama, Y. ∙ Mizushima, N. TMEM41B functions with VMP1 in autophagosome formation Autophagy. 2019; 15 :922-923 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ). Given this homology and the fact that both TMEM41B and VMP1 scored as hits in our flavivirus screens, we tested all four members of the VTT domain family for their requirement in flavivirus infection. Further, in addition to ZIKV and YFV (strain: Asibi) used in our screens, we included three additional flaviviruses: YFV 17D (vaccine strain), DENV-2, and WNV.
To test which of the four VTT domain-containing proteins are required for flavivirus infection, we used CRISPR-Cas9 gene disruption to generate clonal HAP1 cell lines individually lacking VMP1, TMEM41A, TMEM41B, and TMEM64 ( Figure S1 A). We then infected three to five independent KO clones for each of these candidate host factors with each of the five flaviviruses listed above or with human parainfluenza virus 3 (hPIV-3) as a non-flavivirus control. Consistent with our screening results, we found that of these four VTT domain-containing proteins, only TMEM41B and VMP1 are required for flavivirus infection ( Figures 1 D, 1H, S1 B, S1D, and S1F). While TMEM41B was not required for hPIV-3 infection, decreased growth of hPIV-3 was observed in the VMP1 KO clones ( Figure S1 H). VMP1 KO clones appear less viable and grow slower compared to wild-type (WT) cells, which likely accounts for the slight decrease in replication seen for hPIV-3.
We next expressed each of the four VTT domain-containing proteins individually in TMEM41B KO and VMP1 KO cells to test their ability to restore virus infection. As expected, TMEM41B overexpression completely restored infection in TMEM41B KO cells. Interestingly, we found that VMP1 and TMEM41A overexpression partially compensated for the lack of TMEM41B during flavivirus infection. In contrast, only VMP1 was able to rescue infection in VMP1 KO cells ( Figures 1 E, 1F, 1I, and 1J). Furthermore, VMP1 expression restored the observed decrease in cell viability in VMP1 KO cells and rescued hPIV-3 replication ( Figures S1 J and S1K). The capacity of VMP1 to rescue a TMEM41B defect but not vice versa is consistent with what has been shown for TMEM41B and VMP1 in the context of autophagy ( Morita et al., 2019 46. Morita, K. ∙ Hama, Y. ∙ Mizushima, N. TMEM41B functions with VMP1 in autophagosome formation Autophagy. 2019; 15 :922-923 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Since both TMEM41B and VMP1 have been shown to be involved in autophagy, we wondered if canonical autophagy-related genes were essential for flavivirus infection ( Moretti et al., 2018 44. Moretti, F. ∙ Bergman, P. ∙ Dodgson, S. ... TMEM41B is a novel regulator of autophagy and lipid mobilization EMBO Rep. 2018; 19 :e45889 Crossref Scopus (110) PubMed Google Scholar ; Morita et al., 2019 46. Morita, K. ∙ Hama, Y. ∙ Mizushima, N.

CRISPR screening using an expanded toolkit of autophagy reporters identifies TMEM41B as a novel autophagy factor PLoS Biol. 2019; 17 :e2007044 Crossref Scopus (91) PubMed Google Scholar ). To test this, we generated clones lacking BECN1, ATG5, and ATG7, which are known to play a critical role in autophagy ( Kang et al., 2011 29. Kang, R. ∙ Zeh, H.J. ∙ Lotze, M.T. ... The Beclin 1 network regulates autophagy and apoptosis Cell Death Differ. 2011; 18 :571-580 Crossref Scopus (1925) PubMed Google Scholar ; Mizushima et al., 1998 43.

We confirmed KO in these clones by genome sequencing as well as by western blot (for ATG5 and ATG7) ( Figure S2 A). ATG5 and ATG7 KO clones lack lipidated LC3 II at baseline levels, indicative of defective autophagy ( Tanida et al., 2008 77. Tanida, I. ∙ Ueno, T. ∙ Kominami, E. LC3 and Autophagy Methods Mol. Biol. 2008; 445 :77-88 Crossref Scopus (1386) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tanida and Waguri, 2010 75. Tanida, I. ∙ Waguri, S. Measurement of autophagy in cells and tissues Methods Mol. Biol. 2010; 648 :193-214 Crossref Scopus (138) PubMed Google Scholar ). We then further tested ATG7 KO clones for their ability to respond to classical autophagy stimuli (e.g., starvation and treatment with Torin 1 in the presence of chloroquine). As expected, ATG7-deficient cells are unable to undergo autophagy. This is shown by western blot in Figure S2 B, where autophagy induction leads to LC3 I lipidation and conversion to LC3 II in WT cells but not in ATG7 KO HAP1 clones ( Tanida et al., 2008 77. Tanida, I. ∙ Ueno, T. ∙ Kominami, E. LC3 and Autophagy Methods Mol. Biol. 2008; 445 :77-88 Crossref Scopus (1386) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tanida and Waguri, 2010 75. Tanida, I. ∙ Waguri, S. Measurement of autophagy in cells and tissues Methods Mol. Biol. 2010; 648 :193-214 Crossref Scopus (138) PubMed Google Scholar ). We then tested these autophagy-deficient cells for their ability to support flavivirus infection and found that cells lacking BECN1, ATG5, or ATG7 retained their ability to support flavivirus infection ( Figures 1 G, 1K, S1 C, S1E, S1G, and S1I). These data suggest that in this cell type, canonical autophagy is not required for flavivirus infection. This does not, however, exclude a requirement for non-canonical autophagy mechanisms nor does it suggest TMEM41B and VMP1 are the only autophagy factors required for flavivirus infection. In fact, two other non-classical autophagy genes were enriched in our YFV screen (TBC1D5 and TBC1D20) and in our ZIKV screen (TBC1D20) underscoring the complex interplay between flavivirus replication and the autophagy pathway ( Popovic et al., 2012 53.

To gain additional insight into the requirement of TMEM41B for flavivirus infection, we extended our studies to include tick-borne flaviviruses, viruses from additional genera within the Flaviviridae family, and a diverse panel of unrelated viruses.
The tick-borne flaviviruses we tested include Powassan virus (POWV), a biosafety level 3 (BSL3) pathogen currently expanding in North America in Ixodes ticks ( Dennis et al., 1998 10. Dennis, D.T. ∙ Nekomoto, T.S. ∙ Victor, J.C. ... Reported distribution of Ixodes scapularis and Ixodes pacificus (Acari: Ixodidae) in the United States J. Med.

Entomol. 2010; 55 :95-110 Crossref Scopus (168) PubMed Google Scholar ; Eisen et al., 2016 15. Eisen, R.J. ∙ Eisen, L. ∙ Beard, C.B. County-Scale Distribution of Ixodes scapularis and Ixodes pacificus (Acari: Ixodidae) in the Continental United States J. Med. Entomol. 2016; 53 :349-386 Crossref Scopus (308) PubMed Google Scholar ), and five BSL4 pathogens: two strains of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) representing the European and Far Eastern clade and three hemorrhagic fever viruses, Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus (OHFV), Kyasanur forest disease virus (KFDV), and Alkhurma hemorrhagic fever virus (AHFV). In addition, we generated TMEM41B KO clones in hepatocellular carcinoma cells (Huh-7.5) and bovine MDBK cells to test additional members in the Flaviviridae : HCV in the hepacivirus genus and BVDV in pestivirus genus. As shown in Figures 2 A–2D, all of these viruses require TMEM41B for infection. This demonstrates that TMEM41B is a pan-flavivirus host factor.
Flaviviruses replicate in a variety of tissue types. Therefore, we generated TMEM41B KO and reconstituted cell clones in additional mammalian cell lines representing lung adenocarcinoma (A549) and placenta carcinoma (JEG3) epithelial cells. In addition, we knocked out and reconstituted the mosquito TMEM41B ortholog in C6/36 cells ( Aedes albopictus ) and Aag2 cells ( Aedes aegypti ) to determine if TMEM41B was necessary for flavivirus infection in the mosquito vector. We found that TMEM41B was required in nearly all virus-cell combinations ( Figures 2 E, S3 A–S3G, and S4 A–S4E). However, we observed several virus-cell combinations where TMEM41B appears to be less critical. For example, whereas TMEM41B is critical for YFV infection in HAP1, JEG3, and A549 cells, it is not required in Huh-7.5 cells. Notably we even observed differences in the requirement for TMEM41B among two strains of the same virus: the WT Asibi strain of YFV and the 17D vaccine strain that differ by only 31 amino acids ( Figures S3 A and S3D) ( dos Santos et al., 1995 12. dos Santos, C.N. ∙ Post, P.R. ∙ Carvalho, R. ... Complete nucleotide sequence of yellow fever virus vaccine strains 17DD and 17D-213 Virus Res. 1995; 35 :35-41 Crossref Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ). Given that VMP1 can compensate for TMEM41B deficiency, we hypothesized that differences in TMEM41B and VMP1 expression among cell types could potentially explain this variability. We therefore performed western blots on HAP1, JEG3, A549, and Huh-7.5 cell lysates to compare VMP1 and TMEM41B abundance. We found that full-length TMEM41B is highly expressed in HAP1 and JEG3 cells but is present at lower abundance in A549 and Huh-7.5 cells. Further, the TMEM41B antibody detects several abundant lower molecular weight bands in A549 cells that may or may not be TMEM41B isoforms. VMP1, in contrast, is expressed at lower levels in HAP1 cells compared to JEG3, A549, and Huh-7.5 cells ( Figure S4 F). While speculative, we posit that the differential requirement for TMEM41B that we observe in some virus-cell combinations is due to differences in TMEM41B and VMP1 abundance and the extent to which VMP1 can compensate for TMEM41B deficiency.
Given that TMEM41B is broadly required among members of the Flaviviridae , we posited that other more distantly related viruses or unrelated viruses may share a similar requirement for TMEM41B. Using the TMEM41B KO and reconstituted HAP1 cells, we queried the TMEM41B requirement for a diverse panel of viruses including negative- and positive-sense RNA viruses, retroviruses, and DNA viruses. Interestingly, we found that Coxsackievirus 3B (CVB-3) infection is enhanced in the absence of TMEM41B, whereas infection with SARS-CoV-2, a member of the Coronaviridae , is impaired similar to the viruses in the Flaviviridae, suggesting that it also requires TMEM41B for infection. Aside from these two viruses, none of the other viruses tested were affected by the lack of TMEM41B ( Figures 2 F–2I). Our observation that SARS-CoV-2 requires TMEM41B for infection is supported by our recent coronavirus genome-wide CRISPR screening and validation results ( Schneider et al., 2020 64. Schneider, W.M. ∙ Luna, J.M. ∙ Hoffmann, H.-H. ... Genome-scale identification of SARS-CoV-2 and pan-coronavirus host factor networks Cell. 2020; 184 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (238) Google Scholar ).
There are four reported TMEM41B isoforms in humans, however, only isoform 1 encodes a fully intact VTT domain. To determine if any of the other three isoforms can support flavivirus infection, we cloned and expressed each isoform in TMEM41B KO cells. Secondary structure predictions indicate that the first ∼47 amino acids of TMEM41B are unstructured ( Kelley et al., 2015 32. Kelley, L.A. ∙ Mezulis, S. ∙ Yates, C.M. ...

Therefore, we also generated a deletion mutant of isoform 1 lacking the first 47 amino acids. A diagram of these TMEM41B constructs is shown in Figure 3 A. We found that only the full-length and N-terminal truncated isoform 1 proteins were able to fully support YFV and ZIKV infection in TMEM41B KO HAP1 cells; however, isoform 4, which contains half of the VTT domain, partially supported YFV infection ( Figure 3 B). From this we conclude that the TMEM41B VTT domain is required to support flavivirus infection whereas the N terminus is dispensable.
It was reported that TMEM41B physically interacts with VMP1, raising the possibility that this interaction may be important for membrane remodeling in the early stages of autophagy ( Morita et al., 2019 46. Morita, K. ∙ Hama, Y. ∙ Mizushima, N. TMEM41B functions with VMP1 in autophagosome formation Autophagy. 2019; 15 :922-923 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ). Based on this we hypothesized that evolutionarily divergent TMEM41B orthologs may not support flavivirus infection in mammalian cells, given that there are extensive amino acid differences among the mosquito, tick, and human TMEM41B orthologs that may prohibit their interaction with human VMP1 ( Ishii and Akira, 2005 26. Ishii, K.J. ∙ Akira, S. Innate immune recognition of nucleic acids: beyond toll-like receptors Int. J. Cancer. 2005; 117 :517-523 Crossref Scopus (59) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 3 D). To test if mosquito or tick TMEM41B orthologs could support flavivirus infection, we expressed TMEM41B orthologs from Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, and Ixodes scapularis ticks in TMEM41B KO HAP1 cells and challenged them with YFV and ZIKV. To our surprise, we found that all three TMEM41B orthologs supported virus infection in mammalian cells ( Figure 3 C). This suggests that despite amino acid differences, evolutionarily divergent TMEM41B orthologs can either functionally interact with human VMP1 or that a direct protein-protein interaction between TMEM41B and VMP1 is not required to support flavivirus infection.
Viruses and other pathogens have shaped human genetics over millennia. In the face of strong evolutionary pressure, naturally occurring single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can be enriched or purged from human populations. We investigated if any missense variants existed in human TMEM41B and found a SNP (rs78813996) at amino acid position 266 that results in an Ile266Val/Leu substitution with Val being the most prevalent variant. This SNP is nearly absent in European and African populations but is present at ∼3.5% frequency in the Latin American population and at a striking ∼20% frequency in the East and South East Asian population ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/rs78813996 ) ( Figure 4 A).
We engineered these amino acid variants into a TMEM41B expression construct with a red fluorescent protein (tagRFP) fused to the N terminus. Western blot confirmed that both the tagRFP-TMEM41B WT and SNP I266L and I266V variants were expressed to similar levels in TMEM41B KO HAP1 cells ( Figures S5 A and S5B). We then challenged these cells with YFV and found that at 48 h post infection, the percent infection in cells expressing the I266L and I266V variants was reduced by 56% and 62% respectively, and that these cells produced >10-fold less virus as compared to cells expressing WT TMEM41B ( Figures 4 B and 4C). Consistent with these results, ZIKV, DENV, and WNV infection rates decreased by 41%–67% in cells expressing the SNP variants, whereas the hPIV-3 control was unaffected ( Figure 4 D). These results suggest that naturally occurring variants in TMEM41B could potentially affect flavivirus pathogenesis in humans.
While culturing TMEM41B KO Huh-7.5 cells, we observed a striking visual accumulation of lipids. To confirm that these were lipid droplets, we stained WT and six independent TMEM41B KO Huh-7.5 clones with Nile red and found that in all clones, lipid droplets are considerably larger as compared to WT cells ( Figure 4 E). We then quantified this observation by measuring the area of individual droplets from a single imaging plane in at least 23 cells per clone and found that the average size of individual lipid droplets was up to 10 times larger among TMEM41B KO clones relative to WT cells ( Figure 4 F). Moretti et al. (2018) 44. Moretti, F. ∙ Bergman, P. ∙ Dodgson, S. ... TMEM41B is a novel regulator of autophagy and lipid mobilization EMBO Rep. 2018; 19 :e45889 Crossref Scopus (110) PubMed Google Scholar reported a similar observation in TMEM41B KO H4 neuroglioma cells, and it was later shown that these droplets contain neutral and sterol lipids ( Kang et al., 2020 30. Kang, Z.B. ∙ Moutsatsos, I. ∙ Moretti, F. ... Fluopack screening platform for unbiased cellular phenotype profiling Sci. Rep. 2020; 10 :2097 Crossref Scopus (12) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Having found that two naturally occurring TMEM41B variants, I266L and I266V, have a reduced capacity to support flavivirus infection, we next tested if these variants were able to rescue the enlarged lipid droplet phenotype. In addition to the two human variants, we also included the Aedes aegypti TMEM41B ortholog. As shown in Figure 4 G, we found that expression of WT human and mosquito TMEM41B as well as the two human TMEM41B variants reduced the mean lipid droplets size to baseline. These results suggest that while these two SNPs negatively impact flavivirus infection, they appear to be fully functional in their ability to maintain normal lipid distribution as measured in this assay.
Next, we assayed whether the cellular localization of TMEM41B changed upon virus infection. We utilized the tagRFP-TMEM41B expression construct to monitor TMEM41B cellular localization prior to and during flavivirus infection. Previous imaging and proteomics experiments have shown that TMEM41B localizes to ER membranes ( Moretti et al., 2018 44. Moretti, F. ∙ Bergman, P. ∙ Dodgson, S. ... TMEM41B is a novel regulator of autophagy and lipid mobilization EMBO Rep. 2018; 19 :e45889 Crossref Scopus (110) PubMed Google Scholar ; Morita et al., 2019 46. Morita, K. ∙ Hama, Y. ∙ Mizushima, N. TMEM41B functions with VMP1 in autophagosome formation Autophagy. 2019; 15 :922-923 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our observations in TMEM41B KO HAP1 cells expressing tagRFP-TMEM41B are consistent with ER localization. Interestingly, upon infection with either YFV or ZIKV, we observed a striking re-localization of tagRFP-TMEM41B from a diffuse reticular-like pattern to a large cytosolic aggregate that co-localized with viral nonstructural proteins, NS4A (ZIKV) and NS4B (YFV) ( Figure 5 A). This is consistent with a previous report that found ZIKV NS4B interacts with TMEM41B ( Scaturro et al., 2018 62. Scaturro, P. ∙ Stukalov, A. ∙ Haas, D.A. ... An orthogonal proteomic survey uncovers novel Zika virus host factors Nature. 2018; 561 :253-257 Crossref Scopus (116) PubMed Google Scholar ). NS4A and NS4B are multipass transmembrane proteins known to induce membrane curvature, which, together with additional nonstructural viral and likely host proteins, form the viral RNA replication complex.
To further confirm that TMEM41B co-localizes with NS4A and NS4B, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments using an anti-RFP antibody to immunoprecipitate tagRFP-TMEM41B. We found that NS4A in lysates from ZIKV-infected cells and NS4B in lysates from YFV-infected cells co-immunoprecipitated with tagRFP-TMEM41B, whereas NS4A or NS4B was not detected in immunoprecipitates from lysates from uninfected cells or infected cell lysates immunoprecipitated with an immunoglobulin G (IgG) isotype control antibody ( Figures 5 B and 5C). We probed these blots for β-actin to confirm that similar amounts of lysate were used as input, and we probed for RFP to confirm that equal amounts of tagRFP-TMEM41B were immunoprecipitated in both uninfected and infected cells ( Figures S6 A and S6B). All together, these results suggest that TMEM41B is recruited to sites of viral RNA replication either indirectly or potentially by direct interaction with NS4A and/or NS4B.
Viruses exist as diverse populations of variants and can readily adapt to new environments. These genetic adaptations can highlight viral proteins or viral RNA structures that are under selective pressure in a given context. Throughout our experiments, we observed rare YFV and ZIKV antigen-positive cells after infecting clonal TMEM41B KO populations. To gain potential insight into which stage of the virus replication cycle was affected by the absence of TMEM41B, we sought to capitalize on these rare infection events to select for adaptive mutations within the viral genome. We did this by serial passaging of ZIKV-infected cells and culture supernatants to select viral variants capable of replicating in TMEM41B-deficient cells. We performed virus supernatant passaging experiments in human TMEM41B KO A549 and HAP1 cells, and in parallel, we passaged ZIKV-infected TMEM41B KO mosquito Aag2 cells. Serial passages were performed in multiple independent lineages for each cell type, and we similarly passaged virus in WT cells to control for cell culture adaptive mutations that arise, which are unrelated to TMEM41B KO. Figure 6 A shows a graphical outline of these experiments.
After 15–20 rounds of passaging, we deep-sequenced viral cDNA from cell supernatants to identify viral variants that were enriched in virus populations passaged in TMEM41B KO cells relative to virus populations passaged in WT cells. To qualify as a potential adaptive mutation, we applied a stringency filter that required mutations to be present in at least three independent passages (regardless of cell type) and not present in virus that had been passaged in WT cells. Remarkably, all mutations that met these criteria were located in NS4A and NS4B. Further, NS4B mutations at positions Ile42 and Ser236 were selected in both mosquito and mammalian cells ( Figure 6 B).
To confirm that these mutations we selected enable ZIKV to infect TMEM41B-deficient cells, we chose to introduce two mutations in NS4B, Ile42Thr and Phe91Tyr, into the infectious cDNA clone of the Cambodian ZIKV strain FSS13025 ( Shan et al., 2016 69. Shan, C. ∙ Xie, X. ∙ Muruato, A.E. ... An Infectious cDNA Clone of Zika Virus to Study Viral Virulence, Mosquito Transmission, and Antiviral Inhibitors Cell Host Microbe. 2016; 19 :891-900 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (213) PubMed Google Scholar ) and generated viral stocks. Figures 6 C and 6D demonstrate that these individual point mutations in NS4B render ZIKV infectious in both mosquito (Aag2) and mammalian (A549) TMEM41B KO cells.
As shown in Figures 2 E and S3 A, we observed that Asibi and 17D strains of YFV were differentially sensitive to TMEM41B deficiency in A549 cells. The live-attenuated YFV 17D vaccine strain differs from the parental Asibi strain by only 31 amino acids, three of which are located within NS4A (V107I) and NS4B (M95I and Y232H) ( dos Santos et al., 1995 12. dos Santos, C.N. ∙ Post, P.R. ∙ Carvalho, R. ... Complete nucleotide sequence of yellow fever virus vaccine strains 17DD and 17D-213 Virus Res. 1995; 35 :35-41 Crossref Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ). Given the strain-specific differences we observed in TMEM41B KO A549 cells, together with the observation that single amino acid changes in NS4B could allow flavivirus replication in TMEM41B KO cells, we next generated 17D:Asibi chimeric viruses by swapping NS4A and NS4B individually or by swapping the region containing both NS4A and NS4B, which includes the 2K protein. Remarkably, we found that in the 17D viral background, NS4B from the Asibi strain significantly increased infection in TMEM41B KO A549 cells, whereas the NS4B from the 17D strain slightly decreased the infectivity of the Asibi strain in TMEM41B KO cells. In contrast, the NS4A changes had no impact on infection. Importantly, parallel infections in WT A549 cells show that the results observed in the KO cells are not due to an overall increase or decrease in viral replication but rather were likely due to a differential requirement for TMEM41B in this cellular context ( Figures 6 E and 6F).
While studying flavivirus infection in TMEM41B KO cells, we observed an apparent cytotoxicity with high virus inocula (MOI > 5 plaque-forming units [PFU]/cell) that was not seen with similar inocula to WT cells. We hypothesized that this cytotoxicity may have resulted from an exaggerated innate immune response due to increased exposure of viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) in TMEM41B-deficient cells. This hypothesis is based on recent evidence supporting a role for TMEM41B in mobilizing lipids and inducing membrane curvature ( Moretti et al., 2018 44. Moretti, F. ∙ Bergman, P. ∙ Dodgson, S. ... TMEM41B is a novel regulator of autophagy and lipid mobilization EMBO Rep. 2018; 19 :e45889 Crossref Scopus (110) PubMed Google Scholar ; Morita et al., 2019 46. Morita, K. ∙ Hama, Y. ∙ Mizushima, N. TMEM41B functions with VMP1 in autophagosome formation Autophagy. 2019; 15 :922-923 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ) and our own and other data, which indicate that TMEM41B is likely recruited to flavivirus replication complexes ( Scaturro et al., 2018 62. Scaturro, P. ∙ Stukalov, A. ∙ Haas, D.A. ... An orthogonal proteomic survey uncovers novel Zika virus host factors Nature. 2018; 561 :253-257 Crossref Scopus (116) PubMed Google Scholar ). Flavivirus replication complexes are sites at which viral RNA replication machinery assembles within invaginations into the ER lumen utilizing host curvature-stabilizing proteins ( Aktepe and Mackenzie, 2018 2. Aktepe, T.E. ∙ Mackenzie, J.M. Shaping the flavivirus replication complex: It is curvaceous! Cell. Microbiol. 2018; 20 :e12884 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ; Neufeldt et al., 2018 48. Neufeldt, C.J. ∙ Cortese, M. ∙ Acosta, E.G. ... Rewiring cellular networks by members of the Flaviviridae family Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2018; 16 :125-142 Crossref Scopus (241) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rajah et al., 2020 54. Rajah, M.M. ∙ Monel, B. ∙ Schwartz, O. The entanglement between flaviviruses and ER-shaping proteins PLoS Pathog. 2020; 16 :e1008389 Crossref Scopus (10) PubMed Google Scholar ). Within these structures, dsRNA intermediates that form during viral RNA replication are protected from host innate immune sensors that survey the cytosol for pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). In the absence of TMEM41B, viral RNA replication may initiate in aberrant replication complexes that are exposed to the cytosol.
This hypothesis assumes that TMEM41B is required for viral RNA replication, not virus entry. To test this, we transfected WT and TMEM41B KO HAP1 cells with a YFV Renilla reniformis luciferase (Rluc) reporter subgenomic replicon ( Jones et al., 2005 28. Jones, C.T. ∙ Patkar, C.G. ∙ Kuhn, R.J. Construction and applications of yellow fever virus replicons Virology. 2005; 331 :247-259 Crossref Scopus (136) PubMed Google Scholar ) to bypass the entry step, and we measured Rluc over a time course. Indeed, results in Figure S7 A confirm that the transfected RNA is translated, but RNA replication is severely impaired. While this does not entirely rule out a role for TMEM41B in virus entry, it nevertheless provides concrete evidence that TMEM41B is required for virus RNA replication.
We next tested if the cytotoxicity we observed in TMEM41B KO HAP1 cells upon infection with a virus inoculum sufficient to infect most cells during the initial infection was due to innate immune activation. For this, we inoculated WT and TMEM41B KO HAP1 cells with YFV 17D virus (MOI = 0.4 PFU/cell), then quantified viral RNA and mRNA encoding 2′-5′-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1) by qPCR at 24 h post infection. OAS1 is a classic interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene (ISG) induced by type I and III IFNs. As shown in Figure 7 A, we found that YFV 17D RNA levels were 100-fold lower in TMEM41B KO cells compared to WT cells, consistent with an inability to replicate; however, OAS1 was highly induced in the KO cells but not induced in WT cells ( Figure 7 B, left). To determine if OAS1 induction was due to the virus itself or functional viral RNA, we inoculated both WT and TMEM41B KO cells with viral particles inactivated by UV light. UV-inactivated virus failed to induce OAS1 expression in both cell lines suggesting that viral protein production and perhaps initiation of viral RNA replication was required to induce innate immunity ( Figure 7 B, middle). To control for the possibility that TMEM41B KO cells are hypersensitive to PAMPs in general, we infected both WT and TMEM41B KO cells with a recombinant influenza A virus (IAV) lacking a critical innate immune antagonist protein, NS1 (IAV ΔNS1). This virus is well known for its defect in antagonizing IFN production and ISG expression ( García-Sastre et al., 1998 19. García-Sastre, A. ∙ Egorov, A. ∙ Matassov, D. ... Influenza A virus lacking the NS1 gene replicates in interferon-deficient systems Virology. 1998; 252 :324-330 Crossref Scopus (856) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2000 79. Wang, X. ∙ Li, M. ∙ Zheng, H. ... Influenza A virus NS1 protein prevents activation of NF-kappaB and induction of alpha/beta interferon J. Virol. 2000; 74 :11566-11573 Crossref Scopus (479) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that both WT and TMEM41B KO responded to IAV ΔNS1 as expected, with WT cells expressing even slightly higher amounts of OAS1 mRNA than TMEM41B KO cells ( Figure 7 B, right).
Upon detection of viral PAMPs, cells secrete IFN to protect neighboring cells from infection then subsequently initiate apoptosis ( Drappier and Michiels, 2015 13. Drappier, M. ∙ Michiels, T. Inhibition of the OAS/RNase L pathway by viruses Curr. Opin. Virol. 2015; 15 :19-26 Crossref Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ; Gusho et al., 2020 21. Gusho, E. ∙ Baskar, D. ∙ Banerjee, S. New advances in our understanding of the “unique” RNase L in host pathogen interaction and immune signaling Cytokine. 2020; 133 :153847 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ; Schwartz and Conn, 2019 67. Schwartz, S.L. ∙ Conn, G.L. RNA regulation of the antiviral protein 2′-5′-oligoadenylate synthetase Wiley Interdiscip. Rev. RNA. 2019; 10 :e1534 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ). To assay if apoptosis explained the cytotoxicity we observed in TMEM41B KO cells after virus inoculation, we infected WT and TMEM41B KO cells with YFV 17D (MOI = 4 PFU/cell) and quantified the number of apoptotic cells at 24 h post inoculation. As shown in Figure 7 C, we observed an approximate 3-fold increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells in TMEM41B KO cells compared to WT cells. Importantly, at this time point, there was almost no increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells in the infected WT cell population as compared to mock-infected cultures. Further, the positive control, staurosporine (STS), induced apoptosis in approximately 70% of the cells, with no notable difference between WT and TMEM41B KO cells ( Figure 7 C).
We next sought to test if the enhanced innate immune activation in response to flavivirus infection in TMEM41B-deficient cells could explain the block in virus infection. For this, we utilized inhibitors targeting TBK1 and JAK proteins to block IFN production and signaling, respectively. We found that while the presence of these inhibitors increased infection frequency of YFV-17D and ZIKV in WT cells, they were unable to rescue infection in TMEM41B KO cells ( Figures S7 B and S7C). Together, these data suggest that sensing dsRNA and innate immune activation is a consequence of TMEM41B-deficiency, but innate immune activation does not fully explain the block in flavivirus replication.

Section: Discussion

Genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 gene disruption screens are a powerful method of discovery. We applied this method to discover cellular host factors that flaviviruses require to replicate in human cells. As a testament to the robustness of this approach, our results along with CRISPR-Cas9 screens performed by several other research groups identified shared genes and biological pathways. Screens, however, are often only the first step toward understanding new virus-host biology.
In our follow-up studies, we found that all flaviviruses we tested, including both mosquito-borne and tick-borne flaviviruses, required TMEM41B for infection and replication. Further, we found that TMEM41B was required in the mosquito vector as well, supporting a conserved role for TMEM41B in flavivirus infection in distantly related species. Given that TMEM41B is required for flavivirus infection and that TMEM41B is also required for autophagy, the question arose: is autophagy required for flavivirus infection? Our results suggest that under the conditions we tested, the full autophagy pathway is not essential for flavivirus infection. This led us to hypothesize that flaviviruses may hijack TMEM41B and VMP1 for their ability to remodel host cell membranes—a feature required both for autophagy and for the formation of viral replication complexes.
Although every flavivirus we tested required TMEM41B in most cell types, there were several virus-cell combinations we tested where TMEM41B was either not required or played a less essential role in virus infection. This conundrum may be explained by cell-type-specific differences in the abundance of related cellular host proteins such as VMP1 and TMEM41A, which we found can partially support flavivirus infection in the absence of TMEM41B. These findings suggest that TMEM41B may be an important cellular determinant that defines flavivirus tissue tropism and pathogenesis. Along these lines, it is notable that a SNP in TMEM41B present in approximately 20% of East and South East Asian and 3.5% of Latin American populations has a reduced capacity to support flavivirus infection. While it is impossible to know for sure what drove selection of this SNP in these populations, it is conceivable that a pathogenic flavivirus may have been involved.
While variations in the host environment can influence virus tropism, so too can variations in the virus. Our studies uncovered that two highly related YFVs, the virulent Asibi strain and the live attenuated 17D vaccine strain, displayed a differential ability to infect JEG3 and A549 cells lacking TMEM41B. The fact that the YFV Asibi and 17D strains differ by only 31 amino acids provided us with an opportunity to investigate the flavivirus TMEM41B dependency down to the level of an individual viral protein. Our results indicate that amino acid differences in NS4A and NS4B between these two strains may be responsible for their differential TMEM41B requirement. Future studies are needed to better understand how single amino acid changes in NS4B (and possibly NS4A) bypass the strong TMEM41B requirement during flavivirus infection. Together these results highlight plasticity even among “essential” host factors and demonstrate that loss of a critical host factor can be overcome by relatively few genetic changes in the viral genome. This contrasts the notion that resistance barriers may be higher when targeting host factors with antiviral therapeutics as opposed to targeting the virus. When dealing with highly diverse viral populations, multi-target drug cocktails are still likely to be important regardless of whether therapies target host or viral factors.
Our final observation where we demonstrate that TMEM41B cells initiate a strong innate immune response when exposed to a large number of virus particles provides mechanistic insights into the role of TMEM41B in the flavivirus replication cycle. Based on our collective results we propose a model, shown in Figure 7 D, where upon flavivirus infection and translation of the viral polyprotein, TMEM41B is recruited to sites on the ER membrane together with NS4A and NS4B where replication complexes are forming ( Neufeldt et al., 2018 48. Neufeldt, C.J. ∙ Cortese, M. ∙ Acosta, E.G. ... Rewiring cellular networks by members of the Flaviviridae family Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2018; 16 :125-142 Crossref Scopus (241) PubMed Google Scholar ; Paul and Bartenschlager, 2015 51. Paul, D. ∙ Bartenschlager, R. Flaviviridae Replication Organelles: Oh, What a Tangled Web We Weave Annu. Rev. Virol. 2015; 2 :289-310 Crossref Scopus (140) PubMed Google Scholar ). This recruitment may be through direct protein:protein interaction or through passive diffusion, where, by mobilizing neutral and sterol lipids, TMEM41B helps lower the local free energy imposed by NS4A- and NS4B-induced membrane curvature. We propose that TMEM41B’s role in facilitating membrane curvature is dependent upon a functional interaction between TMEM41B and VMP1, the latter of which is highly mobile and associates with cell organelles, vesicles, and lipid droplets ( Tábara and Escalante, 2016 74. Tábara, L.C. ∙ Escalante, R. VMP1 Establishes ER-Microdomains that Regulate Membrane Contact Sites and Autophagy PLoS ONE. 2016; 11 :e0166499 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhao et al., 2017 87.

In the absence of TMEM41B, flavivirus NS4A and NS4B proteins (which may or may not be fully processed) assemble and viral RNA replication initiates, but because replication complexes are improperly formed, dsRNA intermediates are exposed to pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). At this point, the infectious replication cycle is aborted because the RNA genome cannot be efficiently copied and the low level of replication that initiates activates innate immune pathways.
Lastly, we and others recently identified TMEM41B as a top scoring hit in genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-function screens designed to identify coronavirus host dependency factors ( Baggen et al., 2020 3. Baggen, J. ∙ Persoons, L. ∙ Jansen, S. ... Identification of TMEM106B as proviral host factor for SARS-CoV-2 bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2020 82.

Genome-scale identification of SARS-CoV-2 and pan-coronavirus host factor networks Cell. 2020; 184 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (238) Google Scholar ). It will be fascinating to learn if TMEM41B is also required to assemble coronavirus replication complexes. In conclusion, TMEM41B may be a candidate target to inhibit the replication of a broad range of emerging and re-emerging flavivirus and coronavirus pathogens.

HAP1 (WT and B3GALT6 KO) (human; sex: male, chronic myeloid leukemia-derived) cells were obtained from Thijn R. Brummelkamp (Netherlands Cancer Institute) and cultured in Iscove’s Modified Dulbecco’s Medium (IMDM, GIBCO) supplemented to contain 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Hyclone, GE Healthcare) and 1% non-essential amino acids (NEAA, ThermoFisher Scientific). A549 cells (human; sex: male, lung epithelial), JEG3 cells (human; sex: female, placenta epithelial), HEK293 derivatives HEK293T/17 and Lenti-X 293T cells (human; sex: female, kidney epithelial) obtained from Takara (cat. 632180), Huh-7.5 heptoma cells (human; sex: male, liver epithelial) ( Blight et al., 2002 5. Blight, K.J. ∙ McKeating, J.A. ∙ Rice, C.M. Highly permissive cell lines for subgenomic and genomic hepatitis C virus RNA replication J. Virol. 2002; 76 :13001-13014 Crossref Scopus (1008) PubMed Google Scholar ), HeLa cells (human; sex: female, cervix epithelial), VeroE6 cells ( Chlorocebus sabaeus ; sex: female, kidney epithelial), BSC-40 cells ( Chlorocebus aethiops ; sex: unspecified, kidney epithelial), BHK-21 cells ( Mesocricetus auratus ; sex: unspecified, kidney fibroblasts) and MDBK cells (bovine; sex: male, kidney epithelial) were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, GIBCO) supplemented to contain 10% FBS (or 10% horse serum [ThermoFisher Scientific] in case of MDBK cells) and 1% NEAA. All mammalian cell lines were obtained from the ATCC unless stated otherwise, cultured at 37°C and incubated with 5% CO 2 . Mosquito C6/36 ( Ae. albopictus , sex: unspecified, neonate larva) and Aag2 ( Ae. aegypti , sex: unspecified, neonate larva) cells were obtained from ATCC and Dr. Maria-Carla Saleh, respectively. Cells were cultured in Leibovitz’s L-15 Medium, without phenol red (ThermoFisher Scientific), supplemented to contain 10% FBS, 1% NEAA, and ∼0.3 g/L tryptose phosphate broth (Sigma-Aldrich) at 28°C in the absence of CO 2 . All cell lines tested negative for contamination with mycoplasma and with the exception for Huh-7.5 cells have not been further authenticated.
HAP1 B3GALT6 KO-Cas9 cells were generated by lentiviral transduction of lentiCas9-Blast, a gift from Feng Zhang (Addgene: #52962; http://n2t.net/addgene:52962 ; RRID: Addgene_52962), followed by selection and expansion in the presence of 1.5 μg/mL blasticidin. The human GeCKO library (A and B) ( Shalem et al., 2014 68. Shalem, O. ∙ Sanjana, N.E. ∙ Hartenian, E. ... Genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screening in human cells Science. 2014; 343 :84-87 Crossref Scopus (3558) PubMed Google Scholar ) was a gift from Feng Zhang and obtained through Addgene (cat. #1000000049). The plasmid was expanded and lentivirus was produced as previously described ( Shalem et al., 2014 68. Shalem, O. ∙ Sanjana, N.E. ∙ Hartenian, E. ... Genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screening in human cells Science. 2014; 343 :84-87 Crossref Scopus (3558) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, the library was electroporated into 100 μL of electrocompetent cells and recovered in 10 mL recovery media according to manufacturer’s protocol (Lucigen: 60242) using a GenePulser II (BioRad). Electroporated cells were plated on 20 × 10 cm carbenicillin selective plates and grown overnight at 32°C. Colonies were scraped from all plates in LB media, combined, and centrifuged to obtain a bacterial cell pellet that was used as input material for plasmid maxiprep (QIAGEN: 12662). To produce lentivirus, each A and B half-library was pooled 1:1, then transiently transfected into HEK293T/17 cells in 20 × 15 cm 2 dishes. Transfection conditions were 5.4 μg library pool, 3.6 μg psPAX2, 1.8 μg pMD2.G and 21.6 μg branched polyethylenimine (PEI) transfection reagent (MilliporeSigma: 408727) per plate. Media was changed 16 h post-transfection. Lentiviral supernatants were collected, passed through a 0.45 μm Stericup PVDF filter (Millipore), concentrated by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 x g for 2 h at 4°C and stored at −80°C. To deliver the GeCKO (A and B) sgRNA library to cells, 2.03 × 10 8 HAP1 B3GALT6 KO-Cas9 cells were transduced at a MOI = 0.4 IU/cell to achieve ∼1,600-fold overrepresentation of each sgRNA. Two days later, media was replaced with fresh media containing 1.5 μg/mL puromycin and cells were expanded for six additional days prior to seeding for ZIKV or YFV infection.
We seeded cells at 3.5 × 10 6 cells per T175 flask and we seeded 15 flasks per replicate (in triplicate) for each virus infection as well as Mock. The following day, the media was removed, and viruses diluted in 10 mL/flask OptiMEM were added to cells. ZIKV was added at MOI = 0.025 PFU/cell and YFV Asibi was added at MOI = 0.5 PFU/cell. After three h on a plate rocker at 37°C, plates were moved to 5% CO2 incubators set to 37°C. Media was changed three days later. Media was changed every 3-4 days to remove dead cells. Mock cells were passaged every 3-4 days and re-seeded at 3.5 × 10 6 cells/flask to maintain library complexity. Cells were harvested approximately twenty days post infection.
Genomic DNA (gDNA) was isolated via DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (QIAGEN: 69504) per the manufacturer’s instructions. The library was amplified from gDNA using a two-step nested PCR approach using the primer sequences listed in Table S1 and described previously ( Yau and Rana, 2018 81. Yau, E.H. ∙ Rana, T.M. Next-Generation Sequencing of Genome-Wide CRISPR Screens Methods Mol. Biol. 2018; 1712 :203-216 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ). All PCRs were performed using Herculase II Fusion DNA polymerase with manufacturer recommended cycling parameters using 5 μg gDNA per 50 μL reaction volume (Agilent: 600679). After PCR1, PCR products were purified using QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN: 8104) and used as a template for PCR2 to add Illumina sequencing adapters and indexes. PCR products were agarose gel purified, pooled and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 at the MSKCC Integrated Genomics Operation using standard Illumina sequencing primers and 50 cycles.

All ORFs were cloned into a modified pTRIPZ vector for lentivirus delivery to cells. All plasmid sequences are available upon request. Lentivirus stocks were generated in Lenti-X 293T cells by co-transfection of plasmids expressing (1) the ORF of interest (2), HIV gag-pol, and (3) the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) in a ratio of 0.55:0.35:0.1 using Lipofectamine 2000 Transfection Reagent (ThermoFisher Scientific: 11668030) at a ratio of 2.5 μl reagent to 1 μg DNA. One day prior to transfection, cells were seeded at 4 × 10 5 cells per well of poly-L-lysine coated 6-well plates. Cells were transfected the following day and six h post transfection media was removed and lentivirus was collected overnight in 2 mL per well. Supernatants were collected at 24 and 48 h, filtered using 0.45-micron syringe filters, and stored at −80°C.
For lentiviral transduction, 3 × 10 5 cells were transferred to 12-well plates in suspension and transduced with several lentivirus dilutions by spinoculation at 1,000 x g for 60 min at 37°C in medium containing 3% FBS, 20 mM HEPES, and 4 μg/mL polybrene. The following day cells were trypsinized and moved to duplicate wells of 6-well plates. At approximately 48 h post transduction one well of each duplicate was selected with 2 μg/mL puromycin. When selection was complete, the selected and unselected replicates were counted to determine approximate MOI and we proceeded to expand cells that were transduced at MOI < 0.3 to ensure that most cells in the population contained a single integrant. The pTRIPZ constructs are doxycycline inducible and all experiments with these constructs were performed after 24 h of pretreatment and in the continued presence of 2 μg/mL doxycycline.
Small guide RNAs (sgRNA) for CRISPR editing were designed using crispor.tefor.net ( Haeussler et al., 2016 22. Haeussler, M. ∙ Schönig, K. ∙ Eckert, H. ... Evaluation of off-target and on-target scoring algorithms and integration into the guide RNA selection tool CRISPOR Genome Biol. 2016; 17 :148 Crossref Scopus (1059) PubMed Google Scholar ) and cloned into lentiCRISPRv2 plasmid CRISPR KO clones were generated by transfection with the relevant guides, selected with 2 μg/mL puromycin for four days prior to single-cell seeding into 96-well plates in the absence of puromycin at a dilution of 0.7 cells/well to obtain single-cell clonal populations. Clones were expanded and screened for protein knockout by western blot analysis or sequencing analysis. Genomic DNA was extracted using the QIAGEN DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (QIAGEN: 69504) and used as a template for amplification of an approximately 500-1,000 bp region flanking the PAM site. Discrete bands were gel-extracted and gene disruption was confirmed by submitting samples to the CCIB DNA Core Facility, Massachusetts General Hospital (Cambridge, MA, USA) for high throughput amplicon sequencing.

For expression in mosquito cells, we replaced the dme phsp70 promoter ( hsp70Bb ) in pDCC6 with the Ae. aegypti polyubiquitin promoter ( aae PUb ) and we replaced the dme U6-2 promoter with the Ae. aegypti U6 promoter ( aae U6; AAEL017774). We also added a selectable puromycin resistance cassette to the hSpCas9. Plasmid sequence is available from Addgene (plasmid #162163). The following sgRNAs were cloned into the abovementioned plasmid. sgRNAs targeting TMEM41B ortholog (AAEL022930-RB) in Aag2 cells: 5′- CAAAGATCTCTACTACCTGG −3′ and 5′- TATGTAGACGAGGACCACGC −3′. sgRNAs targeting TMEM41B ortholog (AALF002881-RA) in C6/36 cells: 5'- CAAACAGTTGGGACGAGTGC −3′ and 5′- TGTAGCTGAGGAGGTCTTCC −3′. All oligos were purchased from IDT. Cells were transfected with the appropriate plasmids using Fugene HD Transfection Reagent (Promega: E2311) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Cells were seeded at ∼50% confluency and complexes were formed using a ratio of 3:1 transfection reagent to plasmid DNA. To generate single cell clones, cells were seeded in 96-well plates (∼0.7 cells/well) in 50% fresh media, and 50% conditioned media and expanded.

Recombinant viruses for the Cambodian ZIKV (strain: FSS13025), the YFV vaccine strain 17D and wildtype Asibi strain, as well as the YF chimeric 17D and Asibi viruses were generated using plasmids encoding the infectious clones. To generate mutant and chimeric viruses, overlapping oligos were created to either introduce point mutations or to allow the amplification of specific coding sequences. PCR reactions were run under standard conditions using KOD Hot Start Master Mix (Sigma-Aldrich: 71842). After subsequent ligation with T4 ligase (NEB: M0202), the plasmid DNA was amplified in competent DH5-ɑ E. coli cells (ThermoFisher Scientific: 18265017). All plasmids encoding WT and mutant/chimeric viruses were sequenced for the absence of unwanted mutations within the viral coding region. For in vitro transcription, 2 μg linearized plasmid DNA was used in a 30 μl reaction with the mMessage mMachine SP6 Transcription Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific: AM1340). RNA integrity was examined by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel. Huh-7.5 cells were subsequently electroporated with 4 μg of YFV RNA mixed into 6 × 10 6 cells, while C6/36 cells were used for electroporating ZIKV RNA under similar conditions. Electroporated cells were incubated for 48-72 h before collecting and titrating supernatants by standard plaque assay in Huh-7.5 cells.
All virus infections and quantification were performed using the doses and time points reported in the figure legends and below for quantification by flow cytometry or microscopy. For infections, cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 10 4 cells/well into black, glass-bottom 96-well plates (PerkinElmer: 6055302) and at 2.5 × 10 4 - 5 × 10 4 cells/well into regular tissue culture 24-well plates. The next day, cells were washed 1x with Opti-MEM (GIBCO) and adsorbed with virus inoculum (50 μl for 96-well and 200 μl for 24-well plates) prepared in Opti-MEM at 37°C. After 1-2 h inoculum was removed, cells were washed with Opti-MEM, fresh media was added, and cells were incubated at 37°C. At the final time point dependent on viral replication kinetics, cells in 24-well plates were lifted with Accumax cell dissociation medium (Sigma: A7089) and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Cells infected with GFP/RFP reporter viruses were pelleted at 930 x g for 5 min at 4°C, resuspended in cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 3% FBS and stored at 4°C until analysis using a LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). FlowJo software v10 (Treestar) was used to obtain the percentage of GFP/RFP-expressing cells, which were graphed using Prism8 (Graphpad).
For non-fluorescent reporter viruses, cells were washed 1x in PBS (+ 2% FBS), permeabilized in 1x BD perm (BD Biosciences: 554723) for 1 h at RT followed by overnight incubation with primary antibody. Cells were then washed three times with BD perm, incubated with secondary antibody for 1 h at RT, washed an additional three times with BD perm, and once with PBS (+ 2% FBS) before being transferred to FACS tubes for flow-cytometry analysis similar as for aforementioned reporter viruses.
Cells infected in 96-well plates were fixed with 10% neutral-buffered formalin, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at RT, washed in PBS with 0.01% Tween20 (PBS-T) and incubated with primary antibody (pan-flavivirus HMAF) overnight. The secondary antibody was used at RT for 1 h together with NucBlue (ThermoFisher Scientific: R37605) to stain for nuclei. Plates were subsequently read using the Perkin Elmer Operetta confocal high content imager with a 10x objective. Images were analyzed with a cell segmentation workflow using Harmony software v4.1 Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA.

Related to Figure 6 : WT Aag2 (n = 1) and TMEM41B KO clones (n = 2) were infected with ZIKV (strain: PRVABC59) at MOI = 0.5 PFU/cell in triplicate. Cells were passaged every 2-3 days for 15 passages after which supernatants were collected and viral RNA was reverse transcribed and sequenced with next generation sequencing (NGS). WT (n = 1) and TMEM41B KO A549 clones (n = 2) and WT (n = 1) and TMEM41B KO HAP1 clones (n = 2), were infected with ZIKV (strain: FSS13025) at MOI = 5 PFU/cell in triplicate. Supernatants were diluted 1:2 and used to inoculate naive cells every 3-4 days for 20 passages after which supernatants were collected and viral RNA was reverse transcribed and sequenced with next generation sequencing (NGS). Missense mutations I42T and F91Y were independently engineered in a ZIKV infectious clone and used to generate virus stocks to infect WT or TMEM41B KO Aag2 cells at MOI = 0.001 PFU/cell for 72 h. WT and TMEM41B KO A549 cells were infected with WT and mutant viruses at MOI = 0.05 PFU/cell for 48 h.

Cells were infected with IAV (ΔNS1) at MOI = 0.1 PFU/cell for 24 h. For apoptosis assay, WT and TMEM41B KO HAP1 cells were infected YFV 17D at MOI = 4 PFU/cell for 24 h or treated with 250 nM staurosporine (STS) and assayed to detect apoptotic cells via Annexin-V staining.
To determine sequences of ZIKVs passaged in mosquito (ZIKV strain: PRVABC59) and in mammalian WT and TMEM41B KO cells (ZIKV strain: FSS13025), RNA from 200 μl supernatants of each individual passage was purified by adding 800 μl TRIzol Reagent (ThermoFisher Scientific: 15596026) plus 200 μl chloroform then centrifuged at 12,000 g x 5 min. The upper aqueous phase was moved to a new tube and an equal volume of isopropanol was added. This was then added to an RNeasy mini kit column (QIAGEN: 74014) and further purified following the manufacturer’s instructions. Viral RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using the Maxima H Minus First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific: K1681) according to the manufacturer’s protocol, amplified using ZIKV-specific primers (available upon request) and submitted to the CCIB DNA Core Facility, Massachusetts General Hospital (Cambridge, MA, USA) for high throughput amplicon sequencing. Briefly, samples were sheared, ligated to Illumina compatible adapters with unique barcodes, and sequenced from both ends on the MiSeq platform with 2x150 run parameters.
Unless otherwise described, cells were fixed in 2% PFA prepared in PBS at RT for 10 min. Cells were then directly stained for intracellular lipid droplets using the Nile Red Staining Kit (Abcam: ab228553) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, or were processed for antigen staining by blocking with PBTG (PBS containing 10% normal goat serum, 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.1% Triton X-100) at RT for 1-2 h. Cells were then incubated with primary antibodies diluted in PBTG (concentrations above) at 4°C overnight. Following four washes with PBS-T, cells were stained with AlexaFluor-conjugated secondary antibodies in PBTG at RT for 1 h. Following one wash with PBS-T, cells were incubated with Hoechst nuclear stain diluted in PBS at RT for 15 min, followed by three additional washes with PBS-T and a final wash with PBS. Images were acquired using a 40x oil immersion objective on an inverted Zeiss Axiovert 200 spinning disk confocal microscope using solid-state 491, 561 and 644 nm lasers (Spectral Applied) for excitation for collection with an Andor iXon 512x512 EMCCD camera using MetaMorph software. Images acquired staining for antigen and intracellular lipid droplets were analyzed using Fiji software ( Schindelin et al., 2012 63. Schindelin, J. ∙ Arganda-Carreras, I. ∙ Frise, E. ...

Cell lysates were prepared in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate [SDS], 0.5% SDC, 1% NP-40 with addition of cOmplete Mini EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablet [Millipore/Sigma: 11836170001]) and incubated on ice for 30 min with frequent vortexing and then clarified at 14,000 x g for 20 min at 4°C. Protein concentration was determined by bicinchoninic (BCA) protein assay (Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit, ThermoFisher Scientific: 23227) and samples were resolved on NuPAGE 4%–12% Bis-Tris gels and Novex 4%–20% Tris-Glycine gels (Invitrogen) followed by transfer onto polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane (Millipore/Sigma: IPVH00010). Membranes were blocked with 5% milk in PBS-T and incubated with primary antibody at 4°C overnight in 5% milk PBST. Membranes were washed 3x with PBST and incubated with secondary antibodies. For chemiluminescent readout, the membranes were incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody and exposed using SuperSignal West Pico PLUS Chemiluminescent Substrate or SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate (ThermoFisher Scientific: 34577 and 34095) by film in a dark room.
TMEM41B KO HAP1 cells reconstituted with full length TMEM41B fused to tagRFP (infected and uninfected) were collected and lysed in nonyl phenoxypolyethoxylethanol (NP-40) buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl 2 , 0.5% NP-40) supplemented with cOmplete Mini EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablet (Millipore/Sigma: 11836170001) and 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) (Millipore/Sigma: 10837091001).

Per sample, 50 μL (1.5 mg) Dynabeads Protein A for Immunoprecipitation (ThermoFisher Scientific: 10001D) were prepared and linked to 5 μg antibodies (rabbit anti-tagRFP and normal rabbit IgG control) according to the manufacture’s protocol. 100 μg of whole cell lysate (WCL) were incubated with beads-antibody complexes for 70 min at RT followed by wash steps according to the manufacture’s protocol. The resulting beads-antibody-antigen complexes were subsequently treated with elution buffer, mixed with NuPAGE® LDS Sample Buffer (ThermoFisher Scientific: NP0008) and NuPAGE® Sample Reducing Agent (ThermoFisher Scientific: NP0009) as per manufacturer’s instructions and denatured for 15 min at 70°C. The precipitated proteins within the eluted fractions were resolved by western blot as described above.
For in vitro transcription of a Renilla reniformis luciferase encoding YFV subgenomic reporter replicon, 1 μg of linearized DNA template was used in a 20 μl reaction of the mMessage mMachine SP6 Transcription Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific: AM1340) following the manufacturer’s protocol and adding 1 μl of additional GTP. In vitro transcribed RNA was purified using the RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN: 74104), examined for integrity by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel and quantified using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer. Next, HAP1 cells (WT, TMEM41B KO and tagRFP-TMEM41B reconstituted KO) were seeded into 24-well plates at 5 × 10 4 cells/well and incubated overnight at 37°C. The next day, 250 ng RNA/well of either WT or the polymerase dead (dDD) YFV replicon were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 Transfection Reagent (ThermoFisher Scientific: 11668030) at a ratio of 2.5:1 μl transfection reagent to μg RNA. Cells were harvested at indicated time points by washing 1x with 250 μl PBS, adding 150 μl of diluted 5x Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega: E1941), incubating for 20 min at RT and storing lysates at −20°C. Samples harvested at different time points were processed together using the Dual-Luciferase® Reporter Assay System (Promega: E1910) and a FLUOstar Omega multimode microplate reader (BMG LABTECH). Raw data was analyzed, normalized and graphed using Excel (Microsoft) and Prism8 (Graphpad).
Hap1 WT and TMEM41B KO cells were seeded into 24-well plates at 5 × 10 4 cells/well. The next day, cells were infected with the YFV vaccine strain 17D, UV-inactivated YFV 17D and IAV (ΔNS1) diluted in Opti-MEM for 2 h at 37°C. Staurosporine (STS) diluted in the culture medium was added to the cells simultaneously. After 2 h cells were washed with Opti-MEM and cultured in fresh medium. After 24 h, detached cells (from supernatant and PBS wash) together with the trypsinized cells were harvested into tubes and samples were prepared on ice for flow cytometry using the Pacific Blue Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit with 7-AAD (Biolegend: 640926) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Cells were subsequently washed twice in binding buffer, followed by fixation in 2% PFA in PBS before subjecting them to flow cytometry using the LSR-II (BD Biosciences). Data was analyzed by FlowJo v10 and graphed by Prism 8 (GraphPad).
HAP1 WT and TMEM41B KO cells were seeded into 24-well plates at 7.5 × 10 4 cells/well. The next day, cells were infected with the YFV vaccine strain 17D, UV-inactivated YFV 17D and IAV (ΔNS1) diluted in Opti-MEM for 2 h at 37°C. After 2 h cells were washed with Opti-MEM before adding fresh culture medium. After 24 h at 37°C, the cells were washed once with PBS, trypsinized, and pelleted before extracting total RNA by using RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN: 74104) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Next, 0.2 μg RNA were reverse transcribed into cDNA using random hexamer primers with the Superscript III First-Strand Synthesis System Kit (Invitrogen: 18080051) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Gene expression was quantified by qRT-PCR using PowerUp SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems: A25742) and gene-specific primers: RPS11: forward: 5′- GCCGAGACTATCTGCACTAC −3′ and reverse: 5′- ATGTCCAGCCTCAGAACTTC- 3′; OAS1: forward: 5′- AGAAATACCCCAGCCAAATCTCT −3′ and reverse: 5′- TGAGGAGCCACCCTTTACCA −3′. The following PCR conditions were used: 56°C for 2 min and 95°C for 10 min (initial denaturation); 45 cycles 95°C for 15 s, 56°C for 15 s and 72°C for 20 s (PCR); followed by 95°C for 10 s, 65°C for 10 s, a slow increase to 95°C (0.07°C/sec) and a final cooling to 50°C (melt curve). The data were analyzed by melt curve analysis for product specificity as well as ΔΔCT analysis for fold changes (after normalization to housekeeping genes) and graphed using Prism 8 (GraphPad).
Statistical details of experiments can be found in the figure legends, including the statistical tests used, exact value of n, what n represents (e.g., number of replicates or number of cell clones) and the definition of error bars (e.g., standard deviation).
FASTQ files were processed and trimmed to retrieve sgRNA target sequences followed by enumeration of sgRNAs in the reference sgRNA library file using MAGeCK ( Li et al., 2014 35. Li, W. ∙ Xu, H. ∙ Xiao, T. ... MAGeCK enables robust identification of essential genes from genome-scale CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screens Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :554 Crossref Scopus (1186) PubMed Google Scholar ). Z-scores were computed using the following approach: for each condition, the log2 fold change with respect to the initial condition was computed. A natural cubic spline with 4 degrees of freedom was fit to each pair of infected and control cells and residuals were extracted. To obtain gene-wise data, the mean residuals for each group of sgRNAs was calculated, a z-score was computed, and a p value was determined using a 2-sided normal distribution test. P values were combined across biological replicates using Fisher’s sumlog approach and corrected for multiple testing using the method of Benjamini & Hochberg.
Upon staining intracellular lipid droplets using Nile red, images were analyzed using Fiji software ( Schindelin et al., 2012 63. Schindelin, J. ∙ Arganda-Carreras, I. ∙ Frise, E. ... Fiji: an open-source platform for biological-image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :676-682 Crossref Scopus (38228) PubMed Google Scholar ) as follows: A maximum z-projection was made from the acquired image stacks, and the particles were identified through a fixed threshold based on control images. After an applied watershed, particles under 5 pixels were excluded as they could not be distinguished from background/noise in control images, and those greater than 5 pixels were counted.
Statistical analysis was performed in Prism (GraphPad Software, v8.0, 2018). The two-tailed Student’s t test was used comparing two conditions. All conditions met the normality assumption by the Shapiro-Wilk test. Statistical significance was defined as a p value < 0.05.
