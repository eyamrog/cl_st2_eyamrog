Title: Structure and engineering of the type III-E CRISPR-Cas7-11 effector complex


Abstract: Summary

The type III-E CRISPR-Cas effector Cas7-11, with dual RNase activities for precursor CRISPR RNA (pre-crRNA) processing and crRNA-guided target RNA cleavage, is a new platform for bacterial and mammalian RNA targeting. We report the 2.5-Å resolution cryoelectron microscopy structure of Cas7-11 in complex with a crRNA and its target RNA. Cas7-11 adopts a modular architecture comprising seven domains (Cas7.1–Cas7.4, Cas11, INS, and CTE) and four interdomain linkers. The crRNA 5′ tag is recognized and processed by Cas7.1, whereas the crRNA spacer hybridizes with the target RNA. Consistent with our biochemical data, the catalytic residues for programmable cleavage in Cas7.2 and Cas7.3 neighbor the scissile phosphates before the flipped-out fourth and tenth nucleotides in the target RNA, respectively. Using structural insights, we rationally engineered a compact Cas7-11 variant (Cas7-11S) for single-vector AAV packaging for transcript knockdown in human cells, enabling in vivo Cas7-11 applications.

Section: Introduction

CRISPR-Cas systems in prokaryotes provide adaptive immunity against foreign nucleic acids via programmed nucleic-acid cleavage by ribonucleoprotein effectors and are divided into two classes (Class 1 and Class 2) based on the number of components in the effector complexes ( Hille et al., 2018 16.

Microbiol. 2020; 18 :67-83 Crossref Scopus (1370) PubMed Google Scholar ). In Class 1 systems, encompassing types I, III, and IV, invading nucleic acids are degraded by multiprotein effector complexes programmed by a CRISPR RNA (crRNA). In Class 2 systems, comprising types II, V, and VI, the effector complexes are formed by a single multidomain Cas protein and a guide RNA. The type II effector Cas9 ( Gasiunas et al., 2012 13.

In contrast, the type VI effector Cas13 is an RNA-guided RNA endonuclease with nonspecific cleavage, known as the collateral activity ( Abudayyeh et al., 2016 2.

The type III CRISPR-Cas systems are divided into six subtypes (III-A–F) and involve a multitude of diverse effector complexes ( Tamulaitis et al., 2017 37.

The type III-A Csm effector comprises five Cas subunits (Csm1–Csm5) and a crRNA ( Jia et al., 2019 18. Jia, N. ∙ Mo, C.Y. ∙ Wang, C. ...

Structures of the CRISPR-Cmr complex reveal mode of RNA target positioning Science. 2015; 348 :581-585 Crossref Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar ). Csm1/Cmr2 and Csm3/Cmr4 belong to the Cas10 and Cas7 family proteins, respectively. The Csm/Cmr effector complex can target both single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) and DNA (ssDNA) ( Samai et al., 2015 32. Samai, P. ∙ Pyenson, N. ∙ Jiang, W. ... Co-transcriptional DNA and RNA cleavage during Type III CRISPR-Cas immunity Cell. 2015; 161 :1164-1174 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (321) PubMed Google Scholar ) and catalyze three distinct enzymatic reactions: crRNA-guided target RNA cleavage, target RNA-binding-induced DNA cleavage, and cyclic oligoadenylate (cOA) production ( Kazlauskiene et al., 2017 21. Kazlauskiene, M. ∙ Kostiuk, G. ∙ Venclovas, Č. ...

Type III CRISPR-Cas systems produce cyclic oligoadenylate second messengers Nature. 2017; 548 :543-548 Crossref Scopus (309) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the Csm/Cmr effectors, multiple Csm3/Cmr4 nuclease subunits cleave target ssRNAs complementary to the spacer-derived guide segment in the crRNA at discrete 6-nucleotide (nt) intervals. Additionally, in type III-A and III-B systems, precursor crRNAs (pre-crRNAs) are processed into mature crRNAs by the stand-alone Cas6 nuclease ( Charpentier et al., 2015 7. Charpentier, E. ∙ Richter, H. ∙ van der Oost, J. ... Biogenesis pathways of RNA guides in archaeal and bacterial CRISPR-Cas adaptive immunity FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2015; 39 :428-441 Crossref Scopus (211) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Recent studies have shown that unlike the canonical multi-subunit type III effectors, the type III-E effector Cas7-11 (also known as gRAMP) is a single-protein effector comprising four Cas7 domains and a Cas11 domain, with a large insertion in the fourth Cas7 domain ( van Beljouw et al., 2021 40. van Beljouw, S.P.B. ∙ Haagsma, A.C. ∙ Rodríguez-Molina, A. ... The gRAMP CRISPR-Cas effector is an RNA endonuclease complexed with a caspase-like peptidase Science. 2021; 373 :1349-1353 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ; Özcan et al., 2021 27. Özcan, A. ∙ Krajeski, R. ∙ Ioannidi, E. ... Programmable RNA targeting with the single-protein CRISPR effector Cas7-11 Nature. 2021; 597 :720-725 Crossref Scopus (133) PubMed Google Scholar ). Biochemical experiments revealed that Cas7-11 associates with a crRNA and cleaves a complementary ssRNA target at two defined positions 6-nt apart, using the conserved catalytic residues in the second and third Cas7 domains. In contrast to the Csm/Cmr effector complexes, Cas7-11 processes its own pre-crRNAs to produce mature crRNAs. In addition, Cas7-11 binds the associated caspase-like Csx29 TPR-CHAT protease, suggesting a potential mechanism of target RNA-induced protease activity for antiviral immunity. Although Cas13 exhibits nonspecific, collateral RNA cleavage activity, Cas7-11 specifically cleaves a target RNA complementary to the crRNA guide and thus exhibits less cell toxicity compared with Cas13. Thus, Cas7-11 can be used as a programmable RNA-targeting tool without collateral activity and cell toxicity and has been applied to RNA knockdown and editing in mammalian cells ( Özcan et al., 2021 27. Özcan, A. ∙ Krajeski, R. ∙ Ioannidi, E. ... Programmable RNA targeting with the single-protein CRISPR effector Cas7-11 Nature. 2021; 597 :720-725 Crossref Scopus (133) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the functional roles of the individual Cas7 domains and the single Cas11 domain of Cas7-11 are unclear, and how Cas7-11 processes its pre-crRNA, recognizes a mature crRNA, and cleaves a target RNA remains enigmatic.
Here, we determined the cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of Desulfonema ishimotonii Cas7-11 in complex with a crRNA and its target RNA. The structure revealed that Cas7-11 adopts a modular architecture consisting of four Cas7 domains (Cas7.1–Cas7.4), a Cas11 domain, an insertion domain, and a carboxy-terminal extension (CTE) domain, with the Cas7 and Cas11 domains connected by four interdomain linkers. The crRNA repeat-derived region is anchored by the Cas7.1 and Cas7.2 domains, and our biochemical analysis indicated that pre-crRNAs are processed at the Cas7.1 active site via an acid-base catalytic mechanism. In contrast, the crRNA spacer region is recognized by the Cas7.2–Cas7.4 and insertion domains, and base pairs with the target RNA to form a guide-target duplex. The thumb-like β-hairpins in the Cas7.2 and Cas7.3 domains intercalate within the guide-target duplex, resulting in base flipping at the fourth and tenth positions, respectively. Accordingly, the catalytic aspartate residues in the Cas7.2 and Cas7.3 domains are located in the vicinity of the scissile phosphodiester bonds between the third and fourth nucleotides and the ninth and tenth nucleotides of the target RNA, respectively. Our structural and biochemical data revealed that Cas7-11 cleaves ssRNA targets before the fourth and tenth nucleotides at the Cas7.2 and Cas7.3 active sites, respectively. Using the structural information, we further engineered compact Cas7-11 variants that can knockdown target transcripts in human cells and fit within single-vector adeno-associated viruses (AAVs). Collectively, this study expands our mechanistic understanding of diverse CRISPR-Cas effector complexes and establishes a framework for the development of new RNA-targeting technologies.

Section: Results

We determined the cryo-EM structure of D. ishimotonii Cas7-11, catalytically inactivated by the D429A/D654A mutations, in complex with a 41-nt crRNA (G(−16)–U25) and its complementary 27-nt target RNA (G1 ∗ –G27 ∗ ) at 2.5-Å resolution ( Figures 1 A, 1B, S1 A–S1E; Table S1 ). The structure revealed that Cas7-11 consists of four Cas7 domains (Cas7.1–Cas7.4) and a Cas11 domain, interspaced with four interdomain linkers (L1–L4), with the Cas7.4 domain harboring an additional large insertion (INS) domain (residues 979–1,293) and a CTE domain (residues 1,507–1,601) ( Figures 1 C and 1D). The Cas7.1–Cas7.4 domains are stacked, forming a right-handed helical filament. Cas11 interacts with Cas7.2 and Cas7.3 at the midpoint and is directly connected to Cas7.1 and Cas7.2 by the L1 (residues 238–259) and L2 (residues 365–401) linkers. Unlike the L3 and L4 linkers, the L1 and L2 linkers are disordered in the present structure, indicating the flexibility of the L1 and L2 linkers and the mobility of the Cas11 domain. The repeat-derived region (referred to as the 5′ tag) of the crRNA is anchored by Cas7.1 and Cas7.2, whereas the spacer-derived region of the crRNA base pairs with the target RNA to form the guide-target duplex, which is recognized by Cas7.2–Cas7.4 and INS. The CTE extensively interacts with Cas7.3, Cas7.4, and L4, structurally reinforcing the Cas7-11 architecture.
The Cas7.1–Cas7.4 domains contain a modified RRM (RNA recognition motif) fold (also known as a ferredoxin-like fold), consisting of a four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet flanked by two α helices in a βαββαβ topology, as commonly observed in the type III-A/B Cas7 proteins (Csm3/Cmr4) ( Jia et al., 2019 18.

Unlike Csm3 and Cmr4, Cas7.1–Cas7.4 contain a zinc-finger motif between the α1 helix and the β2 strand in the RRM fold, with zinc ions in each of the Cas7.1–Cas7.4 domains coordinated by C86/C115/C123/C126, C463/C472/C474/C477, H703/C706/C708/C711, and C965/C1312/C1342/C1345, respectively ( Figures 2 A–2D, and S2 B). These zinc-coordinating residues are highly conserved among the Cas7-11 orthologs ( Figure S3 ), indicating that zinc fingers are shared structural features of the Cas7-11 proteins. Cas7.1–Cas7.3 have thumb-like β-hairpins between the β2 and β3 strands, as in Csm3 and Cmr4 ( Figures 2 A–2C and S2 A). Cas7.1–Cas7.3 also contain unique structural elements, consistent with their distinct functional roles, such as pre-crRNA processing and target RNA cleavage. Cas7.2 and Cas7.3 possess the catalytic residues D429 and D654 for target RNA cleavage between the β1 strand and the α1 helix, respectively ( Figures 2 B and 2C). Cas7.1 contains a conserved putative catalytic residue H43 for pre-crRNA processing in this region ( Figure 2 A). Unlike Cas7.1 and Cas7.2, Cas7.3 has an additional β-hairpin between the β1 strand and the α1 helix ( Figure 2 C). Cas7.4 adopts a highly divergent RRM fold from those of Cas7.1–Cas7.3 and contains a larger insertion (residues 1,365–1,452), rather than a thumb-like β-hairpin, between the β2 and β3 strands ( Figures 2 D and S2 C). The β2-β3 region of Cas7.4 interacts with L4, CTE, and the guide-target duplex. In addition, the INS domain is inserted within the zinc-finger motif of Cas7.4. The Cas11 domain adopts a five-helix bundle resembling those in the other type III Cas11 proteins (Csm2 and Cmr5) ( Figures 2 E and S2 D). The INS domain comprises two five-stranded β-barrels and additional structural elements, including an α helix and a four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet ( Figures 2 F and S2 E). A Dali structural comparison ( Holm, 2020 17. Holm, L. Using Dali for protein structure comparison Methods Mol. Biol. 2020; 2112 :29-42 Crossref Scopus (353) PubMed Google Scholar ) revealed that the two β-barrels of INS are structurally similar to those in cold shock proteins, such as CspB ( Schindelin et al., 1993 34. Schindelin, H. ∙ Marahiel, M.A. ∙ Heinemann, U. Universal nucleic acid-binding domain revealed by crystal structure of the B. subtilis major cold-shock protein Nature. 1993; 364 :164-168 Crossref Scopus (325) PubMed Google Scholar ), and the rest of INS lacks structural similarity with any other known proteins. The INS domain was less resolved in the density map relative to the other domains ( Figure S1 E), suggesting that it is flexible due to limited contacts with the other Cas7-11 domains.
Cas7.1–Cas7.4 form a central filament in the Cas7-11 structure ( Figures S4 A and S4B). Cas7.1–Cas7.3 commonly employ two interfaces for the interactions with their adjacent Cas7 domains (Cas7.2–Cas7.4), as in the Cas7 (Csm3/Cmr4) filaments in the type III-A/B effectors ( Jia et al., 2019 18. Jia, N. ∙ Mo, C.Y. ∙ Wang, C. ... Type III-A CRISPR-Cas Csm complexes: assembly, periodic RNA cleavage, DNase activity regulation, and autoimmunity Mol.

Structure studies of the CRISPR-Csm complex reveal mechanism of co-transcriptional interference Cell. 2019; 176 :239-253 e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (97) PubMed Google Scholar ). At the primary interface, the β1-α1 and α2-β4 regions of a Cas7 domain interact with the β3 strand of the adjacent Cas7 domain ( Figures S4 A and S4B). At the second interface, the thumb-like β-hairpin (in the β2-β3 region) of a Cas7 domain contacts the α1 helix of the adjacent Cas7 domain ( Figures S4 A and S4B). In addition to the two interfaces, each Cas7 domain forms distinct interactions with its adjacent Cas7 domains, consistent with the structural variations among the Cas7.1–Cas7.4 domains. The thumb-like β-hairpins of Cas7.1 and Cas7.2 form additional contacts with the zinc-finger loops (in the α1-β2 region) of Cas7.2/Cas7.3 and Cas7.3/Cas7.4, respectively ( Figures S4 A and S4B). In addition, the thumb-like β-hairpins of Cas7.2 and Cas7.3 interact with Cas7.3 (the additional β-hairpin) and Cas7.4 (the zinc-finger loop and the β1-α1 and β2-β3 regions), respectively ( Figures S4 A and S4B). The L3 and L4 linkers also contribute to stabilizing the Cas7.1–Cas7.4 filament structure. The L3 linker reinforces the interface between Cas7.1 and Cas7.2, whereas the L4 linker adopts a V-shaped conformation and extensively interacts with Cas7.2, Cas7.3, Cas7.4, and CTE ( Figures S4 C and S4D). Cas11 mainly interacts with the β1-α1 regions of Cas7.2 and Cas7.3 ( Figures S4 A and S4B).
The 5′ tag region (G(−15)–C(−1)) of the crRNA adopts a single-stranded conformation and is extensively recognized by Cas7.1 and Cas7.2 ( Figures 3 A, 3B, 4 A, and S5 ). The thumb-like β-hairpin of Cas7.1 intercalates between A(−2) and G(−4), resulting in the base flipping of A(−3) ( Figure 4 B). The nucleobases of A(−2) and G(−4) stack with F186/V172 and F187 in the β-hairpin, respectively, whereas the nucleobases of C(−1) and G (−4) hydrogen bond with A183 and R35, respectively. A(−3) stacks with V176, I450, and R453 in Cas7.2. C(−6) is flipped out, and A(−7), G(−5), and C(−8) form a triple stack, which is sandwiched between R35 and P471 ( Figures 4 C and 4D). The flipped-out C(−6) forms a stacking interaction with R444 and T484 and multiple hydrogen bonds with E13, R448, and V485 ( Figure 4 C), consistent with the previous finding that the mutation of C(−6) abolished target RNA cleavage ( Özcan et al., 2021 27. Özcan, A. ∙ Krajeski, R. ∙ Ioannidi, E. ... Programmable RNA targeting with the single-protein CRISPR effector Cas7-11 Nature. 2021; 597 :720-725 Crossref Scopus (133) PubMed Google Scholar ). G(−5) adopts the syn conformation, and hydrogen bonds with Q103 and the A(−7) backbone phosphate ( Figure 4 D). The nucleobases of U(−9), G(−10), U(−11), A(−12), G(−13), and U(−14) hydrogen bond with Q37, T92/R102, D91, T59/F150, H149, and T59/F150, respectively ( Figure 4 E). G(−15) forms hydrogen-bonding and stacking interactions with R53/N152 and H43/Y55, respectively ( Figure 4 F). In addition to these base-specific contacts, the 5′ tag region forms sequence-independent backbone interactions with Cas7.1 and Cas7.2 ( Figure 3 B). The 15-nt 5′ tag sequence is highly conserved among Cas7-11 orthologs ( van Beljouw et al., 2021 40. van Beljouw, S.P.B. ∙ Haagsma, A.C. ∙ Rodríguez-Molina, A. ... The gRAMP CRISPR-Cas effector is an RNA endonuclease complexed with a caspase-like peptidase Science. 2021; 373 :1349-1353 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ; Özcan et al., 2021 27. Özcan, A. ∙ Krajeski, R. ∙ Ioannidi, E. ... Programmable RNA targeting with the single-protein CRISPR effector Cas7-11 Nature. 2021; 597 :720-725 Crossref Scopus (133) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting that the 5′ tag regions are recognized by Cas7-11 orthologs in a similar manner.
Previous biochemical experiments demonstrated that D. ishimotonii Cas7-11 cleaves pre-crRNAs between positions −16 and −15 in a metal-independent manner to produce mature crRNAs with a 15-nt 5′ tag sequence ( Özcan et al., 2021 27. Özcan, A. ∙ Krajeski, R. ∙ Ioannidi, E. ... Programmable RNA targeting with the single-protein CRISPR effector Cas7-11 Nature. 2021; 597 :720-725 Crossref Scopus (133) PubMed Google Scholar ). We observed a density corresponding to G(−15), but not to G(−16) ( Figure S5 ), suggesting that Cas7-11 cleaved the phosphodiester bond between G(−16) and G(−15) of the crRNA during the complex reconstitution. In the present structure, G(−15) is surrounded by H43, R53, Y55, and N152 in the Cas7.1 domain ( Figure 4 F), and H43, Y55, and N152 are highly conserved in the Cas7-11 orthologs ( Figure S3 ). Thus, we prepared the H43A, Y55A, and N152A Cas7-11 mutants and tested their pre-crRNA processing and target RNA cleavage activities in vitro . The Y55A and N152A mutants exhibited reduced pre-crRNA processing activities ( Figure 4 G), confirming the functional importance of Y55 and N152 in the pre-crRNA processing. An additional cleavage product was observed for the Y55A and N152A mutants, highlighting the functional importance of the observed interactions between Y55/N152 and the 5′ crRNA nucleotide for the correct pre-crRNA processing. Notably, the H43A mutant lacked the processing activity ( Figure 4 G), indicating that H43 is critical for the pre-crRNA processing. Our structural and functional data suggest that H43 serves as a general base and deprotonates the 2′-hydroxy group of U(−16), which then nucleophilically attacks the scissile phosphate between U(−16) and U(−15) in pre-crRNAs. Although the crRNA used for our cryo-EM analysis contains G(−15), rather than U(−15), for an in vitro transcription reaction, U(−15) may also be recognized by H43, R53, Y55, and N152. All of these mutants were capable of target RNA cleavage ( Figure 4 H), consistent with the fact that the pre-crRNA processing site in Cas7.1 is located farther away from the target RNA cleavage sites in Cas7.2 and Cas7.3. The pre-crRNA also supported the target RNA cleavage by Cas7-11 ( Figure 4 H), demonstrating that the pre-crRNA processing is not required for the Cas7-11-mediated target cleavage, as in other CRISPR-Cas effector enzymes, such as Cas13 ( East-Seletsky et al., 2017 10. East-Seletsky, A. ∙ O’Connell, M.R. ∙ Burstein, D. ... RNA targeting by functionally orthogonal Type VI-A CRISPR-Cas enzymes Mol. Cell. 2017; 66 :373-383 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (200) PubMed Google Scholar ). Together, these results indicated that Cas7-11 processes its pre-crRNAs in the Cas7.1 domain via an acid-base catalytic mechanism.
The spacer region (C1–A23, except for U4 and C10) of the crRNA base pairs with the target RNA (G1 ∗ –U23 ∗ ) to form the guide-target duplex ( Figures 3 A, 3B, and S5 ). The last base pair (A23-U23 ∗ ) is capped by R1125 in the INS domain, whereas A24 is splayed out from the duplex and accommodated within a pocket formed by R1045, H1098, and K1099 in the INS domain ( Figures 5 A and 5B). U25 in the crRNA and U24 ∗ /A25 ∗ in the target RNA are disordered in the structure. These structural observations indicate that the 23-nt spacer sequence in the Cas7-11 crRNA serves as a guide segment, consistent with a previous study showing that 22–25-nt, but not 19-nt, spacers support target RNA cleavage by Cas7-11 ( Özcan et al., 2021 27. Özcan, A. ∙ Krajeski, R. ∙ Ioannidi, E. ... Programmable RNA targeting with the single-protein CRISPR effector Cas7-11 Nature. 2021; 597 :720-725 Crossref Scopus (133) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The guide-target duplex comprises three segments (segments 1–3), with base flipping at the fourth and tenth positions between segments 1 and 2 and segments 2 and 3, respectively ( Figures 3 A and S5 ). Intriguingly, segment 3 (11th–23rd base pairs) is further divided into four segments (segments 3.1–3.4), with kinks at the 13th–14th, 15th–16th, and 19th–20th base pairs ( Figures 3 A and S5 ). Segments 3.2–3.4 of the guide-target duplex adopt a characteristic distorted conformation and are recognized by the Cas7.4, INS, and CTE domains ( Figure 5 A). L1564 in CTE and A981/I1292 in INS are wedged into the 15th–16th and 19th–20th base pairs, thereby forming kinks between segments 3.2 and 3.3 and segments 3.3 and 3.4, respectively ( Figures 5 C and 5D). The β2-β3 loop of Cas7.4 (equivalent to the thumb-like β-hairpins of Cas7.2 and Cas7.3) penetrates between the C13-G13 ∗ and G14-C14 ∗ base pairs in the guide-target duplex, resulting in a kink between segments 3.1 and 3.2 ( Figure 5 E). The C13-G13 ∗ and G14-C14 ∗ base pairs interact with L1391 and E1392 in the β2-β3 loop of Cas7.4, respectively.
The thumb-like β-hairpins in Cas7.2 and Cas7.3 intercalate within the guide-target duplex, flipping the fourth and tenth nucleotides, respectively ( Figures 5 F and 5G). Accordingly, segments 1–3.1 (C1-G1 ∗ –C13-G13 ∗ ) adopt an underwound ribbon-like conformation resembling a ladder, rather than a double helix, similar to the guide-target duplexes in the type III-A/B effector complexes ( Jia et al., 2019 18. Jia, N. ∙ Mo, C.Y. ∙ Wang, C. ... Type III-A CRISPR-Cas Csm complexes: assembly, periodic RNA cleavage, DNase activity regulation, and autoimmunity Mol.

Structure studies of the CRISPR-Csm complex reveal mechanism of co-transcriptional interference Cell. 2019; 176 :239-253 e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (97) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures 5 F, 5G, S6 A and S6B). The U3-A3 ∗ and G5-C5 ∗ base pairs stack with F517 and L516 in the β-hairpin in Cas7.2, respectively, whereas the U9-A9 ∗ and U11-A11 ∗ base pairs stack with F757 and K756 in the β-hairpin in Cas7.3, respectively ( Figure 5 G). These four residues are conserved in the Cas7-11 proteins ( Figure S3 ), highlighting their functional importance for the guide-target recognition. The flipped-out U4 and C10 nucleobases are sandwiched between I504/V682 of Cas7.3 and M953/K1489 of Cas7.4, respectively ( Figure 5 G). Moreover, the sugar-phosphate backbone of the crRNA spacer region is extensively recognized by the Cas7.2–Cas7.4, INS, and CTE domains ( Figure 3 B). Together, these structural findings explain the crRNA-guided target RNA recognition mechanism of Cas7-11.
Previous biochemical experiments demonstrated that D. ishimotonii Cas7-11 uses the conserved aspartate residues (D429 and D654) and cleaves the target RNA at two cleavage sites separated by 5–6 nt near the 3′ end of the spacer-complementary region, although the precise cleavage sites were not determined ( Özcan et al., 2021 27. Özcan, A. ∙ Krajeski, R. ∙ Ioannidi, E. ... Programmable RNA targeting with the single-protein CRISPR effector Cas7-11 Nature. 2021; 597 :720-725 Crossref Scopus (133) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the present Cas7-11 (D429A/D654A) structure, A429 in Cas7.2 and A654 in Cas7.3 are located close to the phosphodiester bonds between A3 ∗ and A4 ∗ and between U9 ∗ and C10 ∗ in the target RNA, respectively ( Figures 5 F and 5G). In addition, the backbone phosphate groups between A3 ∗ and A4 ∗ and between U9 ∗ and C10 ∗ are recognized by Y360 and H306 in Cas11, respectively ( Figure 5 G). The configurations of D429 and D654 of Cas7-11 relative to the target RNA are similar to those of the catalytic aspartate residues (D33 in Csm3) in the type III-A effector complex ( Figures S6 A and S6B). These structural observations indicated that D. ishimotonii Cas7-11 cleaves a target RNA between the third and fourth nucleotides (site 1) and between the ninth and tenth nucleotides (site 2), using D429 in Cas7.2 and D654 in Cas7.3, respectively, consistent with a previous study showing that Scalindua brodae Cas7-11 ( Sb -gRAMP) also cleaves a target RNA at these two positions ( van Beljouw et al., 2021 40. van Beljouw, S.P.B. ∙ Haagsma, A.C. ∙ Rodríguez-Molina, A. ... The gRAMP CRISPR-Cas effector is an RNA endonuclease complexed with a caspase-like peptidase Science. 2021; 373 :1349-1353 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To validate our structural findings, we measured the in vitro cleavage activities of Cas7-11 against a 5′-fluorescently labeled, 60-nt ssRNA target, using crRNAs with a mismatch at spacer nucleotides 1–23 (mm1–23). As expected, mm4 and mm10 did not affect the target RNA cleavage ( Figure 5 H), consistent with the base flipping at positions 4 and 10 in the Cas7-11 structure. In contrast, mm3 and mm9 abolished the target RNA cleavage at sites 1 and 2, respectively ( Figure 5 H), indicating that the base pairings at positions 3 and 9 are critical for the target cleavage at sites 1 and 2, respectively. Accordingly, the double mismatch (mm3/9) abolished the target RNA cleavage ( Figure 5 H). These results highlighted the importance of the correct positioning of the scissile phosphate groups for the target RNA cleavage, consistent with the observed interactions between Cas7-11 and the phosphate groups in the target RNA at positions 3 and 9. In addition, mm1 and mm2 attenuated the target cleavage at site 1 ( Figure 5 H), suggesting that the guide-target base pairings at positions 1 and 2 facilitate the base pairing at position 3. Mismatches at the other positions (mm5–8 and mm11–23) did not substantially affect the RNA cleavage ( Figure 5 H). A mismatch at position 5 yielded an additional band above product 1 ( Figure 5 H), suggesting that in addition to the cleavage at sites 1 and 2, the target cleavage occurs between positions 2 and 3, due to the incorrect positioning of the target RNA by the mismatch. Overall, our structural and functional data revealed that Cas7-11 cleaves ssRNA targets before the fourth and tenth nucleotides, counting from the 3′ end of the spacer-complementary region, by the Cas7.2 and Cas7.3 domains, respectively.
Engineering of compact nucleases is valuable for delivery applications where payload packaging capacity is limited, such as AAVs. Given that the INS domain (residues 979–1,293) is distant from the target RNA cleavage sites, we hypothesized that it would be dispensable for target RNA cleavage by Cas7-11. We engineered three Cas7-11 deletion variants, ΔINS-1 (1,290 aa), ΔINS-2 (1,391 aa), and ΔINS-3 (1,529 aa), in which residues 979–1,293, 1,007–1,220, and 1,046–1,121 are deleted from the wild-type (WT) Cas7-11 (1,601 aa) and replaced with a GGGS linker, respectively ( Figure 6 A). We measured their target RNA cleavage activities in vitro and found that the truncated Cas7-11 variants exhibit target RNA cleavage activities comparable with that of the WT Cas7-11 ( Figure 6 B). Using a previously established dual-luciferase assay ( Özcan et al., 2021 27. Özcan, A. ∙ Krajeski, R. ∙ Ioannidi, E. ... Programmable RNA targeting with the single-protein CRISPR effector Cas7-11 Nature. 2021; 597 :720-725 Crossref Scopus (133) PubMed Google Scholar ), we demonstrated that these truncated ΔINS Cas7-11 variants preserved cleavage activity compared with the WT Cas7-11 in mammalian cells ( Figure 6 C). In contrast, the ΔCas11 variant (A259-GGGS-G398) greatly decreased the Gluc transcript knockdown ( Figure 6 C), indicating the importance of the Cas11 domain for target RNA cleavage. Both the WT Cas7-11 and ΔINS Cas7-11 variants also effectively knocked down endogenous mRNA targets (PPIB and MALAT) with comparable efficiency ( Figure 6 D). Given its activity in mammalian cells and value as a tool for in vivo RNA targeting, we named the smallest functional Cas7-11 truncation, ΔINS-1, as Cas7-11S. The reduced sizes of the Cas7-11S and ΔINS-2 variants relative to the WT Cas7-11 enable packaging along with a crRNA expression cassette (either U6 or tRNA promoter) into single AAV vectors ( Figure 6 E). We tested Cas7-11S and ΔINS2 in HEK293FT cells via AAV8 delivery ( Figure 6 F) and found both variants effectively knocked down Gluc mRNA, with higher knockdown efficiencies at higher titers and with tRNA promoter-driven crRNA expression ( Figure 6 G).

Section: Discussion

Cas7-11 is a recently characterized type III-E CRISPR-Cas effector that catalyzes pre-crRNA processing and crRNA-guided target RNA cleavage ( van Beljouw et al., 2021 40. van Beljouw, S.P.B. ∙ Haagsma, A.C. ∙ Rodríguez-Molina, A. ... The gRAMP CRISPR-Cas effector is an RNA endonuclease complexed with a caspase-like peptidase Science. 2021; 373 :1349-1353 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ; Özcan et al., 2021 27. Özcan, A. ∙ Krajeski, R. ∙ Ioannidi, E. ... Programmable RNA targeting with the single-protein CRISPR effector Cas7-11 Nature. 2021; 597 :720-725 Crossref Scopus (133) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, it was unclear how Cas7-11 processes its own pre-crRNA and precisely cleaves target RNAs at two sites. Moreover, a domain responsible for the pre-crRNA processing has not been reported, whereas biochemical studies indicated that the Cas7.2 and Cas7.3 domains participate in target RNA cleavage. In this study, we present the 2.5-Å resolution cryo-EM structure of the Cas7-11–crRNA–target RNA complex and provide mechanistic insights into the pre-crRNA processing and target RNA cleavage by Cas7-11. The Cas7-11 structure revealed that the four Cas7 domains (Cas7.1–Cas7.4) and the Cas11 domain are elegantly interwoven via four interdomain linkers to form a single-protein effector capable of catalyzing the dual RNase activities ( Figure 7 A). In particular, the L4 linker adopts a unique V-shaped conformation and extensively interacts with the four domains (Cas7.2–Cas7.4 and CTE) in Cas7-11, thereby reinforcing the multidomain effector structure.
Our structural and biochemical data revealed that the Cas7.1 domain in Cas7-11 recognizes the 15-nt 5′ tag of the mature crRNA and catalyzes pre-crRNA processing via an acid-base catalytic mechanism ( Figure 7 A). In the type III-A/B systems, the 8-nt crRNA 5′ tag is recognized by the Csm3/Csm4 and Cmr3/Cmr4 subunits in the Csm/Cmr effectors, respectively ( Jia et al., 2019 18. Jia, N. ∙ Mo, C.Y. ∙ Wang, C. ... Type III-A CRISPR-Cas Csm complexes: assembly, periodic RNA cleavage, DNase activity regulation, and autoimmunity Mol.

Structure studies of the CRISPR-Csm complex reveal mechanism of co-transcriptional interference Cell. 2019; 176 :239-253 e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (97) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 7 B). Although the crRNA 5′ tags in the type III-E and III-A/B systems adopt single-stranded conformations, they substantially differ in length and sequence. The Csm/Cmr effectors contain the large Cas10 subunit (Csm1/Cmr2), and the HD and Palm domains of Csm1/Cmr2 catalyze the ssDNA cleavage and cOA synthesis, respectively ( Jia et al., 2019 18. Jia, N. ∙ Mo, C.Y. ∙ Wang, C. ... Type III-A CRISPR-Cas Csm complexes: assembly, periodic RNA cleavage, DNase activity regulation, and autoimmunity Mol. Cell. 2019; 73 :264-277 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar ; You et al., 2019 44. You, L. ∙ Ma, J. ∙ Wang, J. ... Structure studies of the CRISPR-Csm complex reveal mechanism of co-transcriptional interference Cell. 2019; 176 :239-253 e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (97) PubMed Google Scholar ). The D4 domain of Csm1/Cmr2 adopts a helix-bundle structure similar to the Cas11 subunit (Csm2/Cmr5) and participates in the target RNA recognition ( Figure 7 B). Unlike Cas7-11, the Csm/Cmr effectors lack pre-crRNA processing activity, and their pre-crRNAs are typically processed by the stand-alone Cas6 nuclease. Thus, Cas7-11 is unique among the Class 1 type III effectors and resembles the Class 2 effectors, such as Cas12 ( Swarts et al., 2017 36. Swarts, D.C. ∙ van der Oost, J. ∙ Jinek, M. Structural Basis for guide RNA processing and seed-dependent DNA targeting by CRISPR-Cas12a Mol. Cell. 2017; 66 :221-233 e4 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (367) PubMed Google Scholar ) and Cas13 ( East-Seletsky et al., 2016 11. East-Seletsky, A. ∙ O’Connell, M.R. ∙ Knight, S.C. ... Two distinct RNase activities of CRISPR-C2c2 enable guide-RNA processing and RNA detection Nature. 2016; 538 :270-273 Crossref Scopus (809) PubMed Google Scholar ), which process their own pre-crRNAs. Nonetheless, the pre-crRNA processing domain of Cas7-11 (Cas7.1) is structurally unrelated to those of Cas12 (WED) and Cas13 (Helical-1), highlighting the mechanistic diversity of pre-crRNA processing in the CRISPR-Cas systems.
The present structure revealed that similar to the Csm3/Cmr4 subunits in the Csm/Cmr effectors ( Jia et al., 2019 18. Jia, N. ∙ Mo, C.Y. ∙ Wang, C. ...

Structure studies of the CRISPR-Csm complex reveal mechanism of co-transcriptional interference Cell. 2019; 176 :239-253 e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (97) PubMed Google Scholar ), the Cas7.2 and Cas7.3 domains in Cas7-11 recognize the guide-target duplex and induce base flipping at the fourth and tenth nucleotides in the target RNA, thereby achieving the precise cleavage of the target RNA at positions before these nucleotides ( Figure 7 A). The Csm/Cmr effectors contain more Cas7-like (Csm3/Cmr4) and Cas11-like (Csm2/Cmr5) subunits than the equivalent domains of Cas7-11 and thus cleave target RNAs at more sites according to the number of the Csm3/Cmr4 nuclease subunits ( Figure 7 B). Although Cas7-11 and Csm/Cmr commonly use the thumb-like β-hairpins in their Cas7 domains/subunits to induce base flipping in the guide-target duplex at 6-nt intervals, they recognize the peripheral region of the guide-target duplex in distinct manners. In the Csm/Cmr structures, the peripheral duplex consists of contiguous base pairs and is recognized by the Cas7-like Csm5/Cmr6 subunits ( Figure 7 B). In contrast, in the Cas7-11 structure, the peripheral duplex (segments 3.2–3.4) adopts a distorted helical conformation and is recognized by the INS domain containing the two cold shock domains, which are generally involved in nucleic-acid binding ( Figure 7 A). Although the guide-target base pairing at positions 20–23 (segment 3.4) is required for target RNA cleavage by Cas7-11 ( Özcan et al., 2021 27. Özcan, A. ∙ Krajeski, R. ∙ Ioannidi, E. ... Programmable RNA targeting with the single-protein CRISPR effector Cas7-11 Nature. 2021; 597 :720-725 Crossref Scopus (133) PubMed Google Scholar ), a deletion of the INS domain, which interacts with segments 3.2–3.4, did not affect target RNA cleavage ( Figure 6 B). These observations indicate that the guide-target base pairing, but not the interaction with Cas7-11, in segments 3.2–3.4 is important for the target RNA cleavage and suggest that the crRNA spacer base pairs with the target RNA to form a similar guide-target duplex, even when bound to the Cas7-11 ΔINS variants. Therefore, the functional significance of the interaction between the INS domain and the guide-target duplex is currently unclear. Taken together, a structural comparison of the Cas7-11 and Csm/Cmr effectors illuminated significant similarities and substantial differences in their domain/subunit compositions, Cas7/Cas11 stoichiometries, and enzymatic activities, thereby highlighting the molecular diversity of CRISPR-Cas effector enzymes.
A previous study suggested that the type III-D Cas7x3 proteins acquired the fourth Cas7 domain to evolve into the type III-E Cas7-11 proteins ( Özcan et al., 2021 27. Özcan, A. ∙ Krajeski, R. ∙ Ioannidi, E. ... Programmable RNA targeting with the single-protein CRISPR effector Cas7-11 Nature. 2021; 597 :720-725 Crossref Scopus (133) PubMed Google Scholar ). The Cas7-11 structure provides mechanistic and evolutionary insights into the Cas7x3 effectors. Consistent with the notion that the fusion of the fourth Cas7 domain occurred at a later stage in the evolution of the Cas7-11 family effectors, Cas7.4 is structurally divergent from Cas7.1–Cas7.3. Furthermore, the Cas7x3 members lack many of the conserved structural characteristics of Cas7-11. Despite their documented pre-crRNA processing activity ( Özcan et al., 2021 27. Özcan, A. ∙ Krajeski, R. ∙ Ioannidi, E. ... Programmable RNA targeting with the single-protein CRISPR effector Cas7-11 Nature. 2021; 597 :720-725 Crossref Scopus (133) PubMed Google Scholar ), the Cas7x3 proteins lack the Cas7.1 domain, which is essential for both 5′ tag recognition and pre-crRNA processing in Cas7-11 ( Figure S7 ). Furthermore, the zinc-finger motifs are highly conserved among the four Cas7 domains of Cas7-11 but are absent from two of the three Cas7 domains of Cas7x3 ( Figure S7 ), indicating a more complex evolution from Cas7x3 to Cas7-11 than the simple fusion of the additional fourth Cas7 domain. Nonetheless, some of the critical residues, such as those involved in the guide-target duplex recognition, are conserved between the Cas7x3 and Cas7-11 families ( Figure S7 ). Future structural studies of the Cas7x3 family proteins will provide insights into the evolution of the type III-D and III-E effectors.
Structural information of CRISPR-Cas effectors has not only improved our understanding of their elegant RNA-guided target cleavage mechanisms but also facilitated the molecular engineering of a number of new variants with improved functionalities ( Anzalone et al., 2020 5. Anzalone, A.V. ∙ Koblan, L.W. ∙ Liu, D.R. Genome editing with CRISPR-Cas nucleases, base editors, transposases and prime editors Nat. Biotechnol. 2020; 38 :824-844 Crossref Scopus (1253) PubMed Google Scholar ). Based on our structural finding that the INS domain is distant from the target RNA cleavage sites, we developed a series of compact Cas7-11 variants lacking the INS domain. Notably, the smallest Cas7-11S variant was functional in mammalian cells and could be packaged into commonly used AAV vectors, which cannot accommodate WT Cas7-11 with a guide RNA, thus paving the way for the in vivo use of the Cas7-11-mediated knockdown technology. Furthermore, characterizations of the guide-target mismatch positions that modulate the Cas7-11-mediated target RNA cleavage with single-nucleotide specificity could inform potential RNA-sensing applications for diagnostics. Further structure-based engineering of Cas7-11 variants, such as those with enhanced cleavage activity and specificity, will improve the utility of RNA-targeting CRISPR technologies.
Our Cas7-11–crRNA–target RNA structure answered many mechanistic questions about pre-crRNA processing and target RNA cleavage by Cas7-11. However, future structural and functional studies of the relatives of the Cas7-11 family, such as Cas7x3, and the putative binding partners, such as the Csx29 TPR-CHAT protease, will be required for our mechanistic understanding of the type III-D and III-E CRISPR-Cas systems and their effector nucleases. Additionally, future structural studies of other active Cas7-11 orthologs will illuminate the mechanistic similarities and differences between the Cas7-11 family proteins. More insights remain to be explored, including additional truncations that could facilitate viral packaging, and mutagenesis studies informed by catalytic sites to improve the enzyme activity. Many important directions remain that can be explored in future studies.

Escherichia coli cells were cultured at 37°C in LB medium (containing 20 mg/l kanamycin or 100 mg/l ampicillin). HEK293FT cells were acquired from and authenticated by Thermo Fisher Scientific (R70007). HEK293FT cells were grown at 37°C and 5% CO 2 in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium with high glucose, sodium pyruvate and GlutaMAX (Thermo Fisher Scientific), supplemented with 1× penicillin–streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 10% fetal bovine serum (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and passaged using TrypLE Express (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
The gene encoding D. ishimotonii Cas7-11 (residues 1–1,601) was amplified by PCR and cloned into the modified pET vector (Novagen), in which Cas7-11 has an N-terminal maltose-binding protein (MBP) and a C-terminal His 6 -tag. The two inactivating mutations (D429A/D654A) were introduced into Cas7-11 by a PCR-based method, and the sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The MBP–Cas7-11–His 6 protein was expressed in E. coli Rosetta2 (DE3) (Novagen) by induction with 0.1 mM isopropyl β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (Nacalai Tesque) at 20°C overnight. The E. coli cells were lysed by sonication in buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mM imidazole, 1 M NaCl, 3 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and the lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 40,000 g. The supernatant was applied to Ni-NTA Superflow resin (QIAGEN), and MBP–Cas7-11–His 6 was eluted with buffer A containing 300 mM imidazole. The eluted protein was applied to Amylose resin (NEB) and then eluted with buffer B (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 10 mM D-maltose, and 1 mM DTT). The eluted protein was purified by chromatography on a HiTrap Heparin column (GE Healthcare), equilibrated with buffer C (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, and 1 mM DTT). The protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 0.15–2 M NaCl. The peak fraction was collected, and the MBP–Cas7-11–His 6 protein was further purified on a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare), equilibrated with buffer D (20 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 0.5 M NaCl, and 2 mM DTT). The crRNA (39 nucleotides plus 5′ GG for in vitro transcription) and target RNA (25 nucleotides plus 5′ GG) were transcribed in vitro with T7 RNA polymerase ( Table S2 ), and purified by 10% denaturing (7 M urea) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The purified materials were stored at −80°C until use.
For biochemical experiments, the wild-type and mutant Cas7-11 proteins were expressed and purified according to the following procedures. The Cas7-11 proteins were expressed in E. coli (T7 Express lysY Competent E. coli (High Efficiency)) (NEB) by induction with 0.1 mM isopropyl β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (Sigma-Aldrich) at 18°C overnight. The E. coli cells were lysed by sonication in buffer E (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 M NaCl, 1 mM DTT, cOmplete ULTRA protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich), 1.25 U/ml benzonase nuclease (Sigma-Aldrich), and 1 mg/ml lysozyme (Sigma-Aldrich)), and the lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 g. The supernatant was applied to Strep-Tactin Superflow high capacity resin (IBA Lifesciences) and incubated for 1 h. The resin was washed with buffer E, resuspended in buffer F (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 M NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.15% Igepal, and 0.6 μg/ml SUMO protease (prepared in-house)), and then incubated overnight at 4°C. The suspension was poured into a column, and the eluted protein was further purified on a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 column (GE Healthcare), equilibrated with buffer G (10 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.0, 1 M NaCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 , and 2 mM DTT). Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 4–20% Mini-PROTEAN TGX Stain-Free Precast Gels (Bio-Rad). Fractions containing the purified protein were concentrated and buffer-exchanged with buffer H (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.6 M NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, and 2 mM DTT), using Amicon Ultra-4 Centrifugal Filter Units (MWCO 100 kDa) (Millipore). The purified materials were stored at −80°C until use.
The Cas7-11–crRNA–target RNA complex was reconstituted by mixing the purified MBP–Cas7-11–His 6 protein, the crRNA, and the target RNA, at a molar ratio of 1:1.2:1.5 ( Table S2 ). The complex was purified by size-exclusion chromatography on a Superose 6 Increase 10/300 column (GE Healthcare), equilibrated with buffer E (20 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl 2 , and 1 mM DTT). The peak fraction containing the Cas7-11–crRNA–target RNA complex was concentrated to an A 260 of 1.5, using an Amicon Ultra-4 Centrifugal Filter Unit (MWCO 100 kDa). The sample (3 μl) was applied to freshly glow-discharged Au 300 mesh R1.2/1.3 grids (Quantifoil) in a Vitrobot Mark IV (FEI) at 4°C, with a waiting time of 10 s and a blotting time of 4 s under 100% humidity conditions. The grids were plunge-frozen into liquid ethane cooled at liquid nitrogen temperature. The cryo-EM data were collected using a Titan Krios G3i microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific), running at 300 kV and equipped with a Gatan Quantum-LS Energy Filter (GIF) and a Gatan K3 Summit direct electron detector. Micrographs were recorded at a nominal magnification of ×105,000 with a pixel size of 0.83 Å in a total exposure of 52 e − /Å 2 per 64 frames, by the correlated double sampling mode. The data were automatically acquired by the image shift method using the SerialEM software ( Mastronarde, 2005 24. Mastronarde, D.N. Automated electron microscope tomography using robust prediction of specimen movements J. Struct. Biol. 2005; 152 :36-51 Crossref Scopus (3217) PubMed Google Scholar ), with a defocus range of −0.8 to −1.6 μm, and 2,781 movies were acquired.
The data processing was performed using a combination of the cryoSPARC v3.2.0 ( Punjani et al., 2017 29. Punjani, A. ∙ Rubinstein, J.L. ∙ Fleet, D.J. ... cryoSPARC: algorithms for rapid unsupervised cryo-EM structure determination Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :290-296 Crossref Scopus (4028) PubMed Google Scholar ) and Relion3.1 ( Zivanov et al., 2018 46. Zivanov, J. ∙ Nakane, T. ∙ Forsberg, B.O. ... New tools for automated high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination in RELION-3 Elife. 2018; 7 , e42166 Crossref Scopus (2936) PubMed Google Scholar ) software packages. The dose-fractionated movies were aligned using the Patch motion correction, and the contrast transfer function (CTF) parameters were estimated using Patch-Based CTF estimation in cryoSPARC. Particles were automatically picked using Blob picker in cryoSPARC, followed by multiple rounds of reference free 2D classification to curate particle sets. The particles were further curated by cryoSPARC Heterogeneous Refinement (N = 6) using the map derived from cryoSPARC Ab initio Reconstruction as the template. The best class containing 581,179 particles was refined using Homogeneous refinement followed by Non-uniform refinement ( Punjani et al., 2020 30. Punjani, A. ∙ Zhang, H. ∙ Fleet, D.J. Non-uniform refinement: adaptive regularization improves single-particle cryo-EM reconstruction Nat. Methods. 2020; 17 :1214-1221 Crossref Scopus (579) PubMed Google Scholar ), yielding a map at 2.46 Å resolution. To improve the quality of the 3D reconstruction in the INS domain, the particles were imported into Relion and subjected to 3D classification without alignment, using a mask for the INS domain. The selected 135,109 particles were imported back to cryoSPARC, and Non-uniform refinement after local motion correction yielded a map at 2.45 Å resolution, according to the Fourier shell correlation (FSC) = 0.143 criterion ( Rosenthal and Henderson, 2003 31. Rosenthal, P.B. ∙ Henderson, R. Optimal determination of particle orientation, absolute hand, and contrast loss in single-particle electron cryomicroscopy J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 333 :721-745 Crossref Scopus (1610) PubMed Google Scholar ). The local resolution was estimated by BlocRes in cryoSPARC.
The model was built using Nautilus and Buccaneer ( Cowtan, 2006 8. Cowtan, K. The Buccaneer software for automated model building. 1. Tracing protein chains Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62 :1002-1011 Crossref Scopus (1570) PubMed Google Scholar ) in the CCP-EM package ( Burnley et al., 2017 6. Burnley, T. ∙ Palmer, C.M. ∙ Winn, M. Recent developments in the CCP-EM software suite Acta Crystallogr. D Struct. Biol. 2017; 73 :469-477 Crossref Scopus (215) PubMed Google Scholar ) and manually modified using COOT ( Emsley et al., 2010 12. Emsley, P. ∙ Lohkamp, B. ∙ Scott, W.G. ... Features and development of coot Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :486-501 Crossref Scopus (20200) PubMed Google Scholar ) against the density map sharpened using DeepEMhancer ( Sanchez-Garcia et al., 2021 33. Sanchez-Garcia, R. ∙ Gomez-Blanco, J. ∙ Cuervo, A. ... DeepEMhancer: a deep learning solution for cryo-EM volume post-processing Commun. Biol. 2021; 4 :874 Crossref Scopus (471) PubMed Google Scholar ). The model was refined using Real-space refinement in PHENIX ( Afonine et al., 2018a 3. Afonine, P.V. ∙ Poon, B.K. ∙ Read, R.J. ... Real-space refinement in PHENIX for cryo-EM and crystallography Acta Crystallogr. D Struct. Biol. 2018; 74 :531-544 Crossref Scopus (1516) PubMed Google Scholar ) with the secondary structure restraints. Since the MBP and His 6 tags were not resolved in the density map, they were not included in the final model. The structure was validated using MolProbity ( Williams et al., 2018 41. Williams, C.J. ∙ Headd, J.J. ∙ Moriarty, N.W. ... MolProbity: more and better reference data for improved all-atom structure validation Protein Sci. 2018; 27 :293-315 Crossref Scopus (2301) PubMed Google Scholar ) from the PHENIX package. The curve representing model vs. full map was calculated using phenix.mtriage ( Afonine et al., 2018b 4. Afonine, P.V. ∙ Klaholz, B.P. ∙ Moriarty, N.W. ... New tools for the analysis and validation of cryo-EM maps and atomic models Acta Crystallogr. D Struct. Biol. 2018; 74 :814-840 Crossref Scopus (445) PubMed Google Scholar ), based on the final model and the full, filtered and sharpened map. The statistics of the 3D reconstruction and model refinement are summarized in Table S1 . The cryo-EM density maps were calculated with UCSF ChimeraX ( Pettersen et al., 2021 28. Pettersen, E.F. ∙ Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ... UCSF ChimeraX: structure visualization for researchers, educators, and developers Protein Sci. 2021; 30 :70-82 Crossref Scopus (3735) PubMed Google Scholar ), and molecular graphics figures were prepared with CueMol ( http://www.cuemol.org ).
All 5′-labeled ssRNA processing and cleavage targets were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies ( Table S3 ). All crRNA and unlabeled ssRNA targets were prepared with the HiScribe T7 High Yield RNA Synthesis Kit (NEB) ( Table S4 ). In vitro transcription products were then purified with either RNAClean XP magnetic beads (Beckman Coulter) or RNA Clean and Concentrator columns (R1017, Zymo Research). In vitro cleavage assays were performed with 233 nM purified Cas7-11, 30 nM of 5′-Cy5-labeled ssRNA targets, and 200 nM crRNA in nuclease assay buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 60 mM NaCl, and 6 mM MgCl 2 ) supplemented with 4 U of RNase inhibitor, murine (M0314S, NEB). For pre-crRNA processing reactions, the crRNA was omitted, and the pre-crRNA was used in place of the labeled ssRNA target. Reactions were incubated at 37°C for 1 h (unless otherwise indicated) and then quenched by the addition of proteinase K, EDTA, and urea (final concentrations 1 mg/ml proteinase K, 6 mM EDTA, and 400 μM urea) at 50°C for 30 min. Reactions were denatured with 4.5 M urea denaturing buffer at 95°C for 5 min, and loaded onto a 10% (for pre-crRNA processing) or 15% (for target ssRNA cleavage) Novex PAGE Tris–borate–EDTA (TBE)–urea gel (EC6885BOX, Invitrogen), which was run at 200 V at 60°C for 35 min. The gels were imaged with an Odyssey scanner (LI-COR Biosciences).
Mammalian experiments were performed using the HEK293FT cell line, acquired from and authenticated by Thermo Fisher Scientific (R70007). HEK293FT cells were grown at 37°C and 5% CO 2 in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium with high glucose, sodium pyruvate and GlutaMAX (Thermo Fisher Scientific), supplemented with 1× penicillin–streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 10% fetal bovine serum (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and passaged using TrypLE Express (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For transfection, the HEK293FT cells were plated 16 h before transfection at seeding densities of 1.5×10 4 cells per well in a 96-well plate or 1.5×10 6 cells per T25 flask, allowing cells to reach 90% confluency before the transfection. Cells were then transfected with Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific), following the manufacturer’s protocol with 200 ng total plasmid per well in a 96-well plate and 7.7 μg total plasmid in a T25 flask.
To assess RNA knockdown in mammalian cells with reporter constructs, 80 ng of the Cas7-11 expression vector was co-transfected with 80 ng of guide expression plasmid and 40 ng of the dual luciferase reporter ( Tables S5–S7 ). After 48 h, we collected the medium containing the secreted luciferase and measured its activity using the Gaussia Luciferase Assay reagent (GAR-2B; Targeting Systems) and Cypridina (Vargula) luciferase assay reagent (VLAR-2; Targeting Systems) kits. Assays were performed in white 96-well plates on a plate reader (Biotek Synergy Neo 2) with an injection protocol. Luciferase measurements were normalized by dividing the Gluc values by the Cluc values, thus normalizing for any variation between wells. For targeting of endogenous genes, 100 ng of the Cas7-11 expression vector was co-transfected with 100 ng of the guide expression plasmid. After 48 h, the cells were lysed and the RNA was collected according to the previously described method ( Joung et al., 2017 20. Joung, J. ∙ Konermann, S. ∙ Gootenberg, J.S. ... Genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 knockout and transcriptional activation screening Nat. Protoc. 2017; 12 :828-863 Crossref Scopus (716) PubMed Google Scholar ), with the RevertAid RT Reverse Transcription Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific), following the manufacturer’s protocol. Using Fast Advanced Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific), we measured gene expression using the cDNA by TaqMan qPCR probes for the PPIB and MALAT1 transcripts (Integrated DNA Technologies) ( Table S7 ), as well as the GAPDH control probe (Thermo Fisher Scientific). qPCR reactions were assessed on a CFX384 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad), with three 10-μl technical replicates in a 384-well format. All data were analyzed with three biological replicates. No statistical methods were used for determining sample size. No blinding or randomization methods were used during these experiments.
AAV was prepared by designing vectors with truncated Cas7-11 expression, using an EFS promoter or guide expression with a U6 or tRNA promoter. HEK293FT cells were transfected in T25 flasks using Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with 2.0 μg of cargo plasmid, 1.8 μg AAV8 capsid vector, and 3.9 μg AAV helper pAdDeltaF6 plasmid (Addgene 112867) per T25 flask, according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Two days after the transfection, the medium containing the loaded viral vector was filtered using a 0.45-μm filter (Sigma Aldrich), concentrated by an Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter Unit (MWCO 100 kDa), and washed once with 1× DPBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and then the final product was stored at −80°C. To evaluate the knockdown of the luciferase reporter expressed in HEK293FT cells, various titers of AAV were added to the 4×10 4 cells per well in a 96-well plate by spinfection at 2,000 g and 37°C for 2 h. The dual luciferase reporter plasmid was subsequently transfected into the HEK293FT cells at 100 ng per well with Lipofectamine 3000. The cell media were harvested for luciferase chemiluminescence measurements 48 h later. The AAV genome titer was determined by RT-qPCR, using a pair of primers targeting the EFS promoter ( Table S7 ) in the Fast SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), and read out on a CFX384 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System, with three 10-μl technical replicates in a 384-well format.
In vitro experiments were performed at least three times. Data are shown as mean ± SEM ( n = 3 biological replicates). One-tailed Student’s t-test was performed for analysis of significance using GraphPad Prism 9. No statistical methods were used for determining sample size. No blinding or randomization methods were used during these experiments.
