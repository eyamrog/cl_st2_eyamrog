Title: Restoring the Sense of Touch Using a Sensorimotor Demultiplexing Neural Interface


Abstract: Summary

Paralyzed muscles can be reanimated following spinal cord injury (SCI) using a brain-computer interface (BCI) to enhance motor function alone. Importantly, the sense of touch is a key component of motor function. Here, we demonstrate that a human participant with a clinically complete SCI can use a BCI to simultaneously reanimate both motor function and the sense of touch, leveraging residual touch signaling from his own hand. In the primary motor cortex (M1), residual subperceptual hand touch signals are simultaneously demultiplexed from ongoing efferent motor intention, enabling intracortically controlled closed-loop sensory feedback. Using the closed-loop demultiplexing BCI almost fully restored the ability to detect object touch and significantly improved several sensorimotor functions. Afferent grip-intensity levels are also decoded from M1, enabling grip reanimation regulated by touch signaling. These results demonstrate that subperceptual neural signals can be decoded from the cortex and transformed into conscious perception, significantly augmenting function.

Section: Introduction

Spinal cord injury (SCI) damages sensorimotor circuits leading to paralysis, an impaired sense of agency, and sensory dysfunction. Interestingly, recent evidence suggests that a severe clinically complete SCI does not entirely block ascending sensory information transmission from skin innervated below the lesion ( Wrigley et al., 2018; Awad et al., 2015; Ioannides et al., 2002; Sabbah et al., 2002 7.

These important studies demonstrate that, even years after SCI, tactile stimuli that the patients cannot feel evoke changes in cortical activity. “Discomplete” SCIs are now being investigated—where no clinical evidence of fiber tract function is detectable, but spared fibers may affect some physiological activity ( Dimitrijevic, 1987; Sherwood et al., 1992; Finnerup et al., 2004; Wrigley et al., 2018; Awad et al., 2015; Ioannides et al., 2002; Sabbah et al., 2002 7.

Brain Mapp. 2018; 39 :588-598 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is estimated that “sensory discomplete” SCI occurs in a considerable proportion of patients with a clinically complete SCI (∼50 %; Wrigley et al., 2018; Finnerup et al., 2004 24. Finnerup, N.B. ∙ Gyldensted, C. ∙ Fuglsang-Frederiksen, A. ... Sensory perception in complete spinal cord injury Acta Neurol. Scand. 2004; 109 :194-199 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar 86.

Brain Mapp. 2018; 39 :588-598 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ). These clinical studies represent a set of critical findings. The existence of spared somatosensory fibers, and therefore residual somatosensory information, can potentially be leveraged for functional benefit in patients living with a severe SCI.
In this study, we assessed the hypothesis that a brain-computer interface (BCI) could leverage sensory discompleteness, enhance subperceptual touch events, and simultaneously restore both the sense of touch and motor function in a participant with a clinically complete SCI. The study’s participant is chronically paralyzed from a clinically complete AIS-A C5 SCI (American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale, grade A) and has an intracortical recording array implanted in the primary motor cortex (M1) for BCI recordings. During BCI operation, the participant uses his own hand, addressing a major need of patients with SCI ( Anderson, 2004; Snoek et al., 2004; Blabe et al., 2015 4. Anderson, K.D.

Several BCI studies have targeted the motor cortex to decode motor intention alone ( Lebedev and Nicolelis, 2017; Hochberg et al., 2012; Collinger et al., 2013; Gilja et al., 2015; Simeral et al., 2011; Jarosiewicz et al., 2015; Bockbrader et al., 2018; Moxon and Foffani, 2015; Bouton et al., 2016; Friedenberg et al., 2017; Sharma et al., 2016; Skomrock et al., 2018; Schwemmer et al., 2018; Colachis et al., 2018; Ajiboye et al., 2017; Bockbrader et al., 2019 2.

Motor intention decoded from M1 is then used to enhance motor control via a robotic limb, assistive device, or the participant’s own hand via functional electrical stimulation (FES). Sensory discompleteness may allow for touch-related sensory information transmission to the BCI recording site in M1.
If so, this residual touch-related sensory information could be used for restoring the sense of touch. Sensory function can potentially be augmented using a BCI that can decipher residual sensory neural activity from the impaired hand and dynamically translate this into closed-loop sensory feedback that the user can perceive. The sense of touch is critical for multiple aspects of motor control ( Johansson and Flanagan, 2009 43. Johansson, R.S. ∙ Flanagan, J.R. Coding and use of tactile signals from the fingertips in object manipulation tasks Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2009; 10 :345-359 Crossref Scopus (1336) PubMed Google Scholar ). Beyond restoring the sense of touch alone, a BCI can potentially restore both sensory and motor function simultaneously in patients with SCI, even while the participants use their own hands ( Anderson, 2004; Snoek et al., 2004; Blabe et al., 2015 4.

Unfortunately, no studies to date have reported touch-related electrophysiological activity in human M1 following severe AIS-A SCI ( Wrigley et al., 2018; Awad et al., 2015; Ioannides et al., 2002; Sabbah et al., 2002 7.

New evidence for preserved somatosensory pathways in complete spinal cord injury: A fMRI study Hum. Brain Mapp. 2018; 39 :588-598 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ). Even in uninjured humans, there is significant evidence of a separation between touch and movement representations in the cortex ( Harding-Forrester and Feldman, 2018; Kaas, 2012; Goldring and Ratcheson, 1972; Roux et al., 2018; Ibáñez et al., 1995; Stippich et al., 1999; Kurth et al., 1998 35.

Sensory and motor neural signals may be multiplexed ( Akam and Kullmann, 2014 3. Akam, T. ∙ Kullmann, D.M. Oscillatory multiplexing of population codes for selective communication in the mammalian brain Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2014; 15 :111-122 Crossref Scopus (233) PubMed Google Scholar ) together at the BCI recording site, significantly complicating the simultaneous and reliable decoding of multiple device control signals.
Exciting technology now exists to restore sensorimotor function using a BCI-controlled robotic limb ( Flesher et al., 2019 27. Flesher, S.N. ∙ Downey, J.E. ∙ Weiss, J.M. ... Restored tactile sensation improves neuroprosthetic arm control bioRxiv. 2019; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). However, no technologies exist for restoring both motor function and the sense of touch, using the participant’s own hand ( Anderson, 2004; Snoek et al., 2004; Blabe et al., 2015 4. Anderson, K.D. Targeting recovery: priorities of the spinal cord-injured population J. Neurotrauma. 2004; 21 :1371-1383 Crossref Scopus (1489) PubMed Google Scholar 9. Blabe, C.H. ∙ Gilja, V. ∙ Chestek, C.A. ...

Survey of the needs of patients with spinal cord injury: impact and priority for improvement in hand function in tetraplegics Spinal Cord. 2004; 42 :526-532 Crossref Scopus (372) PubMed Google Scholar ). Using the participant’s hand is significantly challenging, as touch transducing systems are dramatically impacted centrally by the spinal lesion following a clinically complete SCI. This can potentially block ascending touch signaling. Furthermore, residual touch-related sensory signaling from the hand may be disrupted during challenging active states and limb reanimation.

Section: Results

In our initial set of experiments, we sought to perform sensorimotor signal demultiplexing from M1, to enable a BCI system capable of simultaneously controlling multiple devices for enhancing both motor and sensory hand function. In principle, this potential BCI technology would leverage sensory discompleteness using residual touch-related signaling from the hand. All experiments were performed in a chronically paralyzed participant with an AIS-A C5 SCI. We first assessed the participant’s residual hand sensory function (in the absence of visual feedback; Kirshblum et al., 2011 49. Kirshblum, S.C. ∙ Burns, S.P. ∙ Biering-Sorensen, F. ... International standards for neurological classification of spinal cord injury (revised 2011) J. Spinal Cord Med. 2011; 34 :535-546 Crossref Scopus (1682) PubMed Google Scholar ). He was unable to perceive mechanical sensory stimuli to skin innervated below spinal level C6 (clinical tactile assay: Figure S1 A). This sensory impairment was also present during FES-mediated object grip. For example, the participant either operated at chance levels or was completely unable to report whether he was gripping an object in the absence of visual feedback ( Figure S1 B), a significant sensory impairment further contributing to motor dysfunction.
We next investigated whether residual sensory information could significantly modulate neural activity following skin stimulation ( Figures S1 C–S1F). Sensory stimuli robustly modulated contralateral M1 ( Figure 1 ; Figure S2 ). Stimulation of skin innervated from above or at the C5 SCI evoked time-locked neural modulation, lasting ∼10 times longer than the stimulus duration ( Figure 1 B). Stimuli applied to skin innervated from below the SCI (index and middle) evoked modest neural modulation in M1, with stimulation to the forearm and thumb evoking significantly larger responses ( Figure 1 C: F[3,380] = 9.8, p < 0.001, Figure 1 D). As expected, separate control experiments demonstrated little to no M1 activation following sensory stimuli to the left arm, ipsilateral to the recording array ( Figure S3 ). These results support the hypothesis that sensory stimuli to skin innervated from both above and below the clinically complete SCI significantly modulates M1.
Next, we explored whether this sensory activity can be decoded from M1. Decodable sensory events could control a feedback device for improving the impaired sense of touch. We trained a support vector machine (SVM) to detect the skin region being passively stimulated (i.e., a “passive sensory decoder”), given the underlying neural activity. Sensory stimulus location was reliably decoded from M1 across a period of several months, performing significantly above chance with low false-positive rates ( Figure 2 ). Interestingly, passive sensory decoders for locations that the participant can feel (forearm and thumb) performed equivalently to passive sensory decoders for locations that the participant largely cannot feel (index and middle) ( Figure 3 ). This result demonstrates the ability to decode residual sensory neural activity from M1 that is below conscious perception, from functionally relevant hand dermatomes. Furthermore, this intracortical electrophysiological evidence of sensory discompleteness extends previous studies using noninvasive imaging of evoked activity ( Wrigley et al., 2018; Awad et al., 2015; Ioannides et al., 2002; Sabbah et al., 2002 7.

New evidence for preserved somatosensory pathways in complete spinal cord injury: A fMRI study Hum. Brain Mapp. 2018; 39 :588-598 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Residual sensory activity could also be decoded in a more challenging context during active object touch using a separate SVM (i.e., a “touch decoder”; Figure 4 ; see STAR Methods ). During validation experiments, touch-decoder activation was synchronized to force application from the hand ( Figure S4 ) and performed with high responsiveness during object touch events (∼84%; Figure 4 A, “touch”; F[4,85] = 777, p < 0.001; Video S1 , A). As expected, the touch decoder was not activated during control cues lacking touch events ( Figure 4 A, No Touch; Video S1 , panels B and C; “rest” occurs when the cued period is off). Specifically, a subset of control cues assessed hand proprioception events. Scripted FES that opened or closed the hand, without object touch, did not significantly activate the touch decoder (touch-decoder responsiveness: hand open = 3.7%, hand closed = 6.2%), demonstrating that hand-muscle proprioceptive signaling does not significantly contribute to touch decoding. These results reveal that residual sensory neural activity can be decoded reliably from M1 during active object manipulation.

Assessing the Touch Decoder: Real-Time Decoding across Cue Types, Related to Figure 4A The touch decoder was tested during ‘touch’ and ‘no touch’ cue types (see Decoding Active Touch Alone of the STAR Methods for more details). Video contains the cue type (left most column), video of the participant’s hand and arm, and the synchronized touch decoder outputs during the given cue type (red trace = touch decoder output; overlaid gray epochs = cue periods; horizontal dashed line = respective device activation threshold). (A) The touch decoder was robustly activated during ‘touch’ cues. (B and C) Control ‘no touch’ cues did not activate the touch decoder (‘Rest’ occurs when the cued period is off). Data shown are exemplary cues from data presented in Figure 4A.
The participant was next interfaced with a vibrotactile array on the right bicep, to enable closed-loop sensory feedback ( Figure 4 B). This interface was controlled in real time by a touch decoder, to enhance the perception of hand sensory events that are significantly impaired following SCI. The closed-loop sensory feedback system was able to detect residual touch-related sensory signals from up to the C8 spinal level, therefore including the insensate regions of the hand (using clinical tactile assay of hand dermatomes; see STAR Methods ). Without using the closed-loop feedback system, the participant operated at chance levels when asked to report whether he was gripping an object ( Figure 4 C, white; in the absence of visual feedback, Kirshblum et al., 2011 49. Kirshblum, S.C. ∙ Burns, S.P. ∙ Biering-Sorensen, F. ... International standards for neurological classification of spinal cord injury (revised 2011) J. Spinal Cord Med. 2011; 34 :535-546 Crossref Scopus (1682) PubMed Google Scholar ), largely due to being completely insensate on the vast majority of his hand (clinical tactile assay: Figure S1 A). Closed-loop sensory feedback enabled improved object touch detection from chance levels to an over 90% detection rate ( Figure 4 C, gray; t(30) = 3.5, p = 0.001; Figure 4 D) compared to control ( Figure 4 C, white). Therefore, subperceptual grip detection at chance levels was significantly enhanced using closed-loop sensory feedback. These significant sensory improvements were enabled by subperceptual sensory neural activity during grip events that is demultiplexed from M1 and enhanced into conscious perception.
We next assessed the hypothesis that afferent and efferent activity in M1 can be demultiplexed to simultaneously control devices for sensory feedback and FES, constituting a “sensorimotor demultiplexing” BCI. The sensorimotor demultiplexing BCI system is shown in Figure 5 A. The touch decoder is used to control closed-loop vibrotactile sensory feedback (red band on bicep) and enhance hand-touch events. The motor decoder is used to simultaneously control FES of the arm (blue bands on forearm) and produce the desired hand movement. Real-time sensorimotor demultiplexing was demonstrated during a modified grasp and release test (GRT; Wuolle et al., 1994 87. Wuolle, K.S. ∙ Doren, C.L.V. ∙ Thrope, G.B. ...

The participant cannot perform this task without using the system (data not shown), similar to our previous studies ( Schwemmer et al., 2018; Colachis et al., 2018 18.

The participant has motor control of his shoulder. This is used to indirectly guide and align his hand during the task. The participant was first cued to position his hand around the object ( Figure 5 B, cue at 0 s) and then generate motor intention to activate FES, initiate hand grasp, and transfer the object. The touch decoder always preceded the motor decoder and was time locked to object touch ( Figure 5 B; Video S2 ). The touch decoder was originally tested using a range of controls (see Figure 4 results). The assessments here extend these findings, demonstrating that the touch decoder is not significantly impacted by neural activity from simultaneous movement intention events.

Sensorimotor Demultiplexing: Real-Time Neural Activity, Decoding, and Device Control, Related to Figure 5B Sensorimotor demultiplexing was performed using separate SVM models trained to recognize either touch events (touch decoder; red trace in bottom right panel) or motor intention events (motor decoder; red trace in bottom right panel) (horizontal dashed line = respective device activation threshold). The ‘Cortex’ panel shows the pseudocolored surface of the patient’s brain with the recording array location in the black box (adapted from Figure 1A; S1 = primary somatosensory cortex, M1 = primary motor cortex, PMC = pre-motor cortex). Live color-coded mean wavelet power (MWP) data are shown at the top right, synchronized to the video of the participant’s hand and object shown at the left of the video. The participant was repeatedly cued to position his hand around the can object, next generate motor intention to activate FES, and finally hand grasp for transferring the object. Touch decoders were time-locked to object touch. As expected, motor decoders followed the touch decoders during each cued transfer (horizontal dashed line = activation threshold).
Sensorimotor demultiplexing BCI control was next enabled using the simultaneous decoding of touch events and motor intention during a set of upper-limb assessments. This closed-loop demultiplexing BCI system enabled significant improvements in sense of agency ( Figure 5 C; t(46) = 3, p = 0.004), motor decoder latency ( Figure 5 D, left; t(148) = 2.9, p = 0.003), and object transfer time ( Figure 5 D, right; t(148) = 2.1, p = 0.03) ( Figure S5 : exemplary decoder inputs and outputs), compared to a motor-only BCI control. Therefore, rapid closed-loop sensory feedback not only augments sensory function but also augments motor function. Furthermore, these results provide substantial evidence that sensory feedback during movement can enhance the sense of agency and other correlates of enhanced sensorimotor integration in patients with upper-limb dysfunction ( Collinger et al., 2018; Darie et al., 2017; Bensmaia and Miller, 2014; Ackerley and Kavounoudias, 2015; Marasco et al., 2018; Flesher et al., 2016, 2017, 2019 1.

Overall, successful sensorimotor demultiplexing occurred on 100% of task trials (198 total trials). These findings demonstrate a BCI system that simultaneously demultiplexes afferent and efferent activity from human cortex for controlling multiple assistive devices and enhancing function.
Our final set of experiments address the burden on BCI users to control moment-to-moment movement using a constant decoded motor intention. Instead of constant motor intention, touch-intensity signaling alone can potentially regulate limb reanimation during object grip. This capability could ensure appropriate BCI-mediated grip-force application, while also freeing the BCI user’s attention and visual stream for other important activities.
We first assessed the hypothesis that multiple levels of afferent touch-intensity signaling from the hand could be decoded from M1 activity. Grip-force output was measured using a replicate of the standardized object with built in calibrated force sensors (see STAR Methods ; grip-force levels are shown below). Three different levels of afferent touch and grip-intensity signals could be reliably decoded from M1 activity during object grip events with low false-positive rates (overall ∼87 % responsiveness; Figure 6 A). As expected, touch and grip-intensity decoders were not activated during control cues, which did not have touch and grip events ( Figure 6 A, FES Alone). Therefore, multiple levels of touch and grip intensity could be decoded from M1 activity.
As a proof-of-concept demonstration, the participant next enabled limb reanimation regulated only by decoded afferent touch and grip-intensity activity in M1 (i.e., FES solely controlled by afferent touch decoders; see STAR Methods ). Trials were initiated at a high grip force ( Figure 6 B, Touch & High Grip trials) or a low grip force ( Figure 6 C, Touch & Low Grip trials) during a long duration grip of the object. Decoded Touch & High Grip served to decrease FES and grip force. Decoded Touch & Low Grip served to increase FES and grip force.
During Touch & High Grip trials ( Figure 6 B), grip force gradually decreased by a total of 810 g (slope test: F = 29, p = 0.003). This was mediated by a decoder-controlled decrease in FES of 1.3 mA. During Touch & Low Grip trials ( Figure 6 C), grip force gradually increased by a total of 120 g (slope test: F = 19, p = 0.007). This was mediated by a decoder-controlled increase in FES of 0.4 mA. As expected, touch-regulated grip forces initially exhibited an adjustment period followed by a steady-state equilibration.
These results support the hypothesis that appropriate grip-force regulation can be controlled by decoded afferent touch and grip-intensity activity in M1. These results extend the sensorimotor demultiplexing BCI control results. Touch-regulated grip-intensity BCI control can be used to enable automated movement cascades while simultaneously addressing a major need of patients with SCI to use their own hand ( Anderson, 2004; Snoek et al., 2004; Blabe et al., 2015 4.

Touch-regulated grip-intensity BCI control demonstrates that limb reanimation controlled by decoded afferent cortical activity is possible. Overall, these results suggest that sensory discompleteness ( Wrigley et al., 2018; Awad et al., 2015; Ioannides et al., 2002; Sabbah et al., 2002 7. Awad, A. ∙ Levi, R. ∙ Lindgren, L. ...

Section: Discussion

Severe AIS-A SCI should essentially eliminate sensory information transmission to the brain that originates from skin innervated from below the lesion. Recent studies demonstrate that residual subperceptual sensory information from below the lesion is transmitted to sensory areas of the brain, even following severe clinically complete SCI ( Wrigley et al., 2018; Awad et al., 2015; Ioannides et al., 2002; Sabbah et al., 2002 7. Awad, A. ∙ Levi, R. ∙ Lindgren, L. ... Preserved somatosensory conduction in a patient with complete cervical spinal cord injury J. Rehabil.

Sabbah, P. ∙ de, S.S. ∙ Leveque, C. ... Sensorimotor cortical activity in patients with complete spinal cord injury: a functional magnetic resonance imaging study J.

New evidence for preserved somatosensory pathways in complete spinal cord injury: A fMRI study Hum. Brain Mapp. 2018; 39 :588-598 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ). These results demonstrate an emerging type of SCI diagnosis—sensory discomplete. Our results extend these findings and provide electrophysiological evidence of sensory discompleteness, showing that touch-related hand sensory signals reach M1 even after AIS-A SCI. Therefore, a clinically complete SCI does not necessarily equate to an anatomically complete SCI. Our findings support the hypothesis that there is some anatomical sparing of spinal tissue even after severe AIS-A SCI, allowing sensory information transmission from below the lesion to M1, at sufficient levels for enabling sensory related BCI capabilities. Importantly, sensory discompleteness has been documented to occur in ∼50% of patients with a clinically complete SCI ( Wrigley et al., 2018; Finnerup et al., 2004 24. Finnerup, N.B. ∙ Gyldensted, C. ∙ Fuglsang-Frederiksen, A. ... Sensory perception in complete spinal cord injury Acta Neurol. Scand. 2004; 109 :194-199 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar 86. Wrigley, P.J. ∙ Siddall, P.J. ∙ Gustin, S.M. New evidence for preserved somatosensory pathways in complete spinal cord injury: A fMRI study Hum. Brain Mapp. 2018; 39 :588-598 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ). This study’s findings have clinical applicability for sensory discomplete SCI, as well as sensory incomplete SCI. Sensory incomplete SCI may also result in residual sensory signaling from impaired dermatomes that can be used for BCI control and functional improvement.
We also chose to use the participant’s natural remaining sensory circuitry for object touch decoding and address the need of patients with SCI to use their own hand during upper-limb activity ( Anderson, 2004; Snoek et al., 2004; Blabe et al., 2015 4. Anderson, K.D. Targeting recovery: priorities of the spinal cord-injured population J. Neurotrauma. 2004; 21 :1371-1383 Crossref Scopus (1489) PubMed Google Scholar 9. Blabe, C.H. ∙ Gilja, V. ∙ Chestek, C.A. ... Assessment of brain-machine interfaces from the perspective of people with paralysis J.

Survey of the needs of patients with spinal cord injury: impact and priority for improvement in hand function in tetraplegics Spinal Cord. 2004; 42 :526-532 Crossref Scopus (372) PubMed Google Scholar ). Previous surveys have documented that systems are unlikely to be used by participants if they are unreliable or difficult to use ( Wielandt et al., 2006 85. Wielandt, T. ∙ Mckenna, K. ∙ Tooth, L. ... Factors that predict the post-discharge use of recommended assistive technology (AT) Disabil. Rehabil. Assist. Technol. 2006; 1 :29-40 Crossref Scopus (71) PubMed Google Scholar ). The residual sensory signals used in the study are rapid, reliable, and arrive from the participant’s hand, obviating the need for an additional device setup. Nonetheless, using a participant’s hand is significantly challenging, due to the impact of severe SCI on touch transducing systems, and the approach of simultaneously demultiplexing touch and movement intention signaling. There are likely additional signal types encoded in M1, beyond motor intention and touch-related sensory information. In the future, we hope this set of findings will enable patients with an implanted BCI to maximize the information encoded in the recorded neural activity for functional gains. Overall, these findings demonstrate a BCI capable of leveraging sensory discompleteness, for simultaneously restoring both the sense of touch and motor function.
BCIs are emerging as a means to treat patients suffering from an array of functional deficits ( Lebedev and Nicolelis, 2017; Hochberg et al., 2012; Collinger et al., 2013; Gilja et al., 2015; Simeral et al., 2011; Jarosiewicz et al., 2015; Bockbrader et al., 2018; Moxon and Foffani, 2015; Bouton et al., 2016; Friedenberg et al., 2017; Sharma et al., 2016; Skomrock et al., 2018; Schwemmer et al., 2018; Colachis et al., 2018; Ajiboye et al., 2017; Bockbrader et al., 2019 2.

A Characterization of Brain-Computer Interface Performance Trade-Offs Using Support Vector Machines and Deep Neural Networks to Decode Movement Intent Front. Neurosci. 2018; 12 :763 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ). Accurately and consistently decoding a single device control signal is a significant challenge for BCIs. Here we extend capabilities of BCI technology to simultaneously decipher multiplexed ( Akam and Kullmann, 2014 3. Akam, T. ∙ Kullmann, D.M. Oscillatory multiplexing of population codes for selective communication in the mammalian brain Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2014; 15 :111-122 Crossref Scopus (233) PubMed Google Scholar ) afferent and efferent neural activity or multiple levels of touch and grip intensity, for dynamically controlling motor and sensory augmentation devices. Our results support the hypothesis that subperceptual residual neural information can be reliably decoded from the human brain, and used to augment function.
The function restored to the participant using the sensorimotor demultiplexing BCI was significant in several sensorimotor functional domains, ranging from the cognitive control of hand function ( Synofzik et al., 2008 82. Synofzik, M. ∙ Vosgerau, G. ∙ Newen, A. I move, therefore I am: a new theoretical framework to investigate agency and ownership Conscious. Cogn. 2008; 17 :411-424 Crossref Scopus (204) PubMed Google Scholar ) to sensorimotor integration. Our control condition throughout all sensorimotor demultiplexing assessments was the participant operating the BCI system using only motor control ( Figure 5 ). This control condition is essentially the most challenging control condition possible under the current experimental design. We therefore have designed all experiments to maximally challenge any measured functional improvements during sensorimotor demultiplexing BCI control. Nonetheless, the effect sizes are robust for the functional gains during sensorimotor demultiplexing BCI control. These gains range from an over a 100% improvement to a significant ∼0.5 s increase in BCI system speed and subsequent upper-limb sensorimotor capability. We hypothesize that even larger improvements can be achieved when assessing additional functions in the absence of visual feedback. Closed-loop tactile feedback and touch-regulated grip intensity can mitigate the reliance of BCI users on visually attending to the state of the hand during movement. This would free the user’s visual stream for other important functions during upper-limb activity. For example, sensorimotor demultiplexing and touch-regulated grip intensity control modes should enable increased BCI operation safety during multitasking, via notifying the user that an object has slipped from his or her grasp or enabling visual attention to other stimuli, other than the hand, during activities of daily living.
Due to the clinically complete cervical SCI, the participant’s hand is almost completely insensate. Nonetheless, touch-related sensory information from completely insensate digits reaches M1 from critical dermatomes needed for almost all hand grasps. Therefore, electrophysiological activity mediated by sensory discompleteness significantly contributes to hand grasps during either sensorimotor demultiplexing or touch-regulated grip intensity BCI control activities. It should be noted that half of the participant’s thumb has some residual abnormal sensation. Regardless, grip event detection involving multiple digits involved either guessing (at chance level) or the complete inability to recognize object grip events ( Figure S1 B). Together, these results support the hypothesis that both grip events and tactile stimuli to single skin locations can be subperceptual.
It is likely that sensory stimulation to dermatomes even more caudal to the SCI location can also be detected during BCI operation and leveraged for functional benefit. Previous studies demonstrate significant cortical modulation following leg or foot sensory stimulation, many spinal levels below a clinically complete cervical, thoracic, or lumbar SCI ( Wrigley et al., 2018; Awad et al., 2015; Ioannides et al., 2002; Sabbah et al., 2002 7.

This potential residual sensory activity from the lower limbs can be leveraged for improvement in future lower limb BCI technologies ( Borton et al., 2014; Capogrosso et al., 2016 12.

Several studies have contributed immensely to our current understanding of the sensory and motor cortex (for review, see Harding-Forrester and Feldman, 2018; Geyer et al., 2012 32. Geyer, S. ∙ Luppino, G. ∙ Rozzi, S. Motor cortex Mai, J. ∙ Paxinos, G. (Editors) The Humannervous System Elsevier, 2012; 1074-1109 Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar 36. Harding-Forrester, S. ∙ Feldman, D.E. Somatosensory maps Handb. Clin. Neurol. 2018; 151 :73-102 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ). While there is preclinical evidence of an overlap between touch and movement representations in the cortex before injury, several studies of human cortex provide significant evidence of a separation between touch and movement representations ( Harding-Forrester and Feldman, 2018; Kaas, 2012; Goldring and Ratcheson, 1972; Roux et al., 2018; Ibáñez et al., 1995; Stippich et al., 1999; Kurth et al., 1998 35.

Severe SCI can largely “disconnect” the sensory cortex and motor cortex from their respective target tissues in the periphery, disrupting any existing sensory and motor cortical overlap. Many reports provide extensive evidence that SCI alone affects numerous attributes of sensory and motor cortical representations (for review, see Moxon et al., 2014; Mohammed and Hollis, 2018; Urbin et al., 2019 58. Mohammed, H. ∙ Hollis, 2nd, E.R.

Following SCI and training, these factors can be significantly modulated, implicating cortical plasticity processes and use dependent cortical reorganization (for review, see Moxon et al., 2014; Mohammed and Hollis, 2018; Urbin et al., 2019 58. Mohammed, H. ∙ Hollis, 2nd, E.R.

Importantly, BCI operation is at times also associated with significant changes in the cortex (for review, see Orsborn and Carmena, 2013 63. Orsborn, A.L. ∙ Carmena, J.M.

A cohort of clinical studies has extended our understanding of the cortex to the context of clinically complete SCI, using a variety of cortical mapping techniques. These studies provide important evidence for sensory discompleteness—where no clinical evidence of fiber tract function is detectable, but spared fibers may affect some physiological activity ( Wrigley et al., 2018; Awad et al., 2015; Ioannides et al., 2002; Sabbah et al., 2002 7. Awad, A. ∙ Levi, R. ∙ Lindgren, L. ... Preserved somatosensory conduction in a patient with complete cervical spinal cord injury J. Rehabil.

Brain activation sequences following electrical limb stimulation of normal and paraplegic subjects Neuroimage. 2002; 16 :115-129 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar 70. Sabbah, P. ∙ de, S.S. ∙ Leveque, C. ... Sensorimotor cortical activity in patients with complete spinal cord injury: a functional magnetic resonance imaging study J. Neurotrauma. 2002; 19 :53-60 Crossref Scopus (113) PubMed Google Scholar 86. Wrigley, P.J. ∙ Siddall, P.J. ∙ Gustin, S.M. New evidence for preserved somatosensory pathways in complete spinal cord injury: A fMRI study Hum. Brain Mapp. 2018; 39 :588-598 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the current study, we leverage sensory discompleteness for restoring the sense of touch and a variety of functional gains. One of the first examinations of supraspinal activity during sensory discomplete states was performed by Sabbah et al. in 2002. This set of investigations utilized functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of cortical structures in several patients, years after clinically complete thoracic or lumbar SCI ( Sabbah et al., 2002 70. Sabbah, P. ∙ de, S.S. ∙ Leveque, C. ... Sensorimotor cortical activity in patients with complete spinal cord injury: a functional magnetic resonance imaging study J. Neurotrauma. 2002; 19 :53-60 Crossref Scopus (113) PubMed Google Scholar ). Sabbah et al. demonstrated that, in the absence of visual feedback, passive stimulation of the toes that the patient cannot feel activates the cortex posterior to the central sulcus in a subset of subjects. Ioannides et al. utilized magnetoencephalography (MEG) mapping of cortical structures in patients, years after clinically complete thoracic SCI ( Ioannides et al., 2002 41. Ioannides, A.A. ∙ Liu, L. ∙ Khurshudyan, A. ... Brain activation sequences following electrical limb stimulation of normal and paraplegic subjects Neuroimage. 2002; 16 :115-129 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ). This study showed that electro-tactile stimulation of the insensate foot evoked time-locked cortical MEG signaling again in the cortex posterior to the central sulcus in a subset of patients. In 2015, Awad et al. performed a study using fMRI of cortical structures in a subject decades after a clinically complete cervical SCI ( Awad et al., 2015 7. Awad, A. ∙ Levi, R. ∙ Lindgren, L. ... Preserved somatosensory conduction in a patient with complete cervical spinal cord injury J. Rehabil. Med. 2015; 47 :426-431 Crossref Scopus (12) PubMed Google Scholar ). Their findings show that subperceptual tactile stimulation to the lower extremities evokes fMRI signaling in the post-central somatosensory cortical modules. Last, Wrigley et al. recently demonstrated that subperceptual tactile stimulation evokes time-locked fMRI signaling in the post-central somatosensory cortex in 11 of 23 subjects with a clinically complete thoracic SCI ( Wrigley et al., 2018 86. Wrigley, P.J. ∙ Siddall, P.J. ∙ Gustin, S.M. New evidence for preserved somatosensory pathways in complete spinal cord injury: A fMRI study Hum. Brain Mapp. 2018; 39 :588-598 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ). A small contingent of ascending fibers in the spinal cord may be involved in these findings, including the dorsal column and spinothalamic pathways. Together, these results demonstrate that subperceptual somatosensory signaling can reach cortical networks after a clinically complete SCI. Our findings extend these important clinical studies, demonstrating intracortical electrophysiological evidence of sensory discompleteness. Overall, our results support the hypothesis that this residual subperceptual signaling can be decoded and leveraged by a BCI, even in challenging active states during limb reanimation.
This study uses closed-loop vibrotactile feedback during BCI operation. There are alternative ways to provide sensory feedback following SCI, including intracortical microstimulation ( Flesher et al., 2016 25. Flesher, S.N. ∙ Collinger, J.L. ∙ Foldes, S.T. ...

Direct electrical stimulation of the somatosensory cortex in humans using electrocorticography electrodes: a qualitative and quantitative report J. Neural Eng. 2013; 10 :036021 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar ). Compared to stimulation in S1, previous studies demonstrate that tactile-based feedback enables rapid sensory perception at a significantly faster latency ( Caldwell et al., 2019; Godlove et al., 2014 14. Caldwell, D.J. ∙ Cronin, J.A. ∙ Wu, J. ... Direct stimulation of somatosensory cortex results in slower reaction timescompared to peripheral touch in humans Sci.

Neural Eng. 2014; 11 :046025 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ). This was a significant contributor to the choice of using vibrotactile feedback in the current study.
BCI electrode arrays for treating upper-limb motor dysfunction are almost exclusively implanted to decode motor intention signals alone ( Lebedev and Nicolelis, 2017; Hochberg et al., 2012; Collinger et al., 2013; Gilja et al., 2015; Simeral et al., 2011; Jarosiewicz et al., 2015; Bockbrader et al., 2018; Bouton et al., 2016; Friedenberg et al., 2017; Sharma et al., 2016; Skomrock et al., 2018; Schwemmer et al., 2018; Colachis et al., 2018; Ajiboye et al., 2017; Bockbrader et al., 2019 2.

Neurosci. 2018; 12 :763 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ). The sensorimotor demultiplexing capability can impact how BCI electrode array implant locations are determined, for interfaces seeking to decode multiplexed information classes relevant for BCI control. It will be critical to perform multimodal pre-surgical brain mapping to localize these relevant neural representations and further inform electrode array implant location. For example, seemingly small areas of the nervous system may simultaneously encode multiplexed ( Akam and Kullmann, 2014 3. Akam, T. ∙ Kullmann, D.M. Oscillatory multiplexing of population codes for selective communication in the mammalian brain Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2014; 15 :111-122 Crossref Scopus (233) PubMed Google Scholar ) classes of sensory, motor, and contextual information relevant for next-generation neural interfaces and context adapting sensorimotor therapeutics. We anticipate future efforts that maximize information extraction from neural data and significantly increase the capability neural interfaces. Furthermore, the data presented here are from a neural interface that has been implanted for over 5 years (at the time of this writing). Reliable next-generation neural interfaces will also need to function for many years to mediate long-term benefits in patients ( Zhang et al., 2018; Downey et al., 2018 23.

Med. 2018; 4 :11 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The human cortex is generally modular and can encode a variety of stimuli or other activity. The sensory signal utilized in this study may arrive in M1 directly, from a separate source via corticocortical transmission and propagating activity, or both ( Takahashi et al., 2011; Rubino et al., 2006 69. Rubino, D. ∙ Robbins, K.A. ∙ Hatsopoulos, N.G. Propagating waves mediate information transfer in the motor cortex Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9 :1549-1557 Crossref Scopus (332) PubMed Google Scholar 83. Takahashi, K. ∙ Saleh, M. ∙ Penn, R.D. ... Propagating waves in human motor cortex Front. Hum. Neurosci. 2011; 5 :40 Crossref Scopus (75) PubMed Google Scholar ). Additional studies are required to further understand the contribution of the neighboring somatosensory cortical modules and subcortical structures to the M1 activity observed in the current study. Nonetheless, evidence is accumulating that M1, and other cortical modules, encode a multiplicity of features related to experience beyond their primary processing designation ( Hatsopoulos and Suminski, 2011; Suminski et al., 2010; Shaikhouni et al., 2013; Hari et al., 1998; Schroeder et al., 2017; Manohar et al., 2017; Ganzer et al., 2013, 2016 30.

Incorporating feedback from multiple sensory modalities enhances brain-machine interface control J. Neurosci. 2010; 30 :16777-16787 Crossref Scopus (169) PubMed Google Scholar ). For future BCI applications, an array of powerful control signals can potentially be demultiplexed from a single recording site, or multiple distributed interfaces. Advanced decoding strategies ( Schwemmer et al., 2018 73. Schwemmer, M.A. ∙ Skomrock, N.D. ∙ Sederberg, P.B. ... Meeting brain-computer interface user performance expectations using a deep neural network decoding framework Nat. Med. 2018; 24 :1669-1676 Crossref Scopus (101) PubMed Google Scholar ) may be needed to decipher the multitude of representations encoded in neural activity and further enable demultiplexing BCIs. Regardless, the results we present here are a step toward the design of next-generation neural interfaces capable of demultiplexing multimodal neural information for distributed device control and functional improvement.

Approval for this study was obtained from the US Food and Drug Administration (Investigational Device Exemption) and The Ohio State University Medical Center Institutional Review Board (Columbus, Ohio). The study met institutional requirements for the conduct of human subjects and was registered on the http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov website (identifier: NCT01997125). The participant referenced in this work completed an informed consent process before commencement of the study. The participant was either completely blinded to the experimental conditions or given brief instructions to complete the necessary actions. Cue and trial parameters were randomized as needed, detailed below.
The study participant was a 27-year-old male with stable, non-spastic C5 quadriplegia resulting from a cervical SCI. The participant had control of full bilateral elbow flexion (grade 5/5), active wrist extension with radial deviation through an incomplete range of motion against gravity (grade 2/5), but no motor function below the level of C6. His sensory level was C5 on the right (because of altered but present light touch on his thumb) and C6 on the left. His injury was clinically complete, with an overall neurological level of C5 American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale A (AIS-A), with zone of partial preservation for motor function to C6 bilaterally according to the International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury ( Kirshblum et al., 2014 50. Kirshblum, S.C. ∙ Biering-Sorensen, F. ∙ Betz, R. ... International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury: cases with classification challenges J. Spinal Cord Med. 2014; 37 :120-127 Crossref Scopus (68) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The participant underwent implantation of a 96 channel Utah microelectrode recording array (Blackrock Microsystems, Inc.; Salt Lake, Utah) in his left primary motor cortex ( Figure 1 A). The hand area of motor cortex was identified preoperatively by fusing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activation maps obtained while the patient attempted movements co-registered to the preoperative planning MRI. Full details of the fMRI and surgical procedures can be found in Bouton et al., 2016.
Neural data was acquired using a Utah microelectrode recording array (Blackrock Microsystems, Inc.; Salt Lake City, Utah) and the Neuroport neural data acquisition system. Recorded data from all 96 recording array channels was sampled at 30 kHz and band pass filtered online from 0.3 – 7.5 kHz using a third order Butterworth analog hardware filter. The neural data was then digitized and sent to a PC for saving or further on-line processing using a custom interface in MATLAB 2014a (The MathWorks; Natick, MA).
We used stimulation artifact removal, mean wavelet power (MWP) estimation, and non-linear support vector machine (SVM) decoding, similar to our previous studies ( Bouton et al., 2016; Sharma et al., 2016; Skomrock et al., 2018; Schwemmer et al., 2018; Colachis et al., 2018; Bockbrader et al., 2019; Annetta et al., 2019 5.

Details for stimulation artifact removal: functional electrical stimulation (FES) induced stimulation artifacts were detected by threshold crossings of 500 μV occurring simultaneously on at least 4 of 12 randomly selected channels. A 3.5 ms window of data around each detected artifact was then removed and adjacent data segments were rejoined. This approach leaves the vast majority of the neural data intact. Our series of control experiments confirm the removal of the stimulation artifact across several contexts (specifically Figures S3 A and S3B; Figures 4 A and 6 A, FES alone). Data collected here combined with our previous studies demonstrates the robust ability to remove artifacts from the data with this approach prior to signal analysis.
Neural activity was next measured using MWP, similar to our previous studies ( Bouton et al., 2016; Friedenberg et al., 2017; Sharma et al., 2016; Skomrock et al., 2018; Schwemmer et al., 2018; Colachis et al., 2018; Bockbrader et al., 2019; Annetta et al., 2019 5.

Details for MWP calculation and SVM decoding: wavelet decomposition was applied to the raw voltage data, using the ‘db4’ mother wavelet and 11 wavelet scales. Wavelet scales 3–6 were used, corresponding to the multiunit frequency band spanning approximately 234 to 3,750 Hz. The mean of the wavelet coefficients for each scale of each channel was calculated every 100 ms and a 1 s wide boxcar filter was applied to smooth the data. Baseline drift in the data was estimated by using a 15 s boxcar filter and was subtracted from the smoothed mean wavelet coefficients for the corresponding 100 ms window. The mean coefficients were then standardized per channel, per scale, by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of those scales and channels during the training blocks. The four scales were then combined by averaging the standardized coefficients for each channel, resulting in 96 MWP values, one for each electrode in the recording array, for every 100 ms of data. The resulting MWP values were used as input to the given non-linear SVM decoder ( Friedenberg et al., 2016 28. Friedenberg, D.A. ∙ Bouton, C.E. ∙ Annetta, N.V. ...

Predictions were used to either evaluate decoder performance offline or control a given end effector device online (e.g., FES). Specific details on SVM hyperparameters or model training and testing methods are provided below for both the passive sensory stimulation or active object touch experiments.
The FES system (either cuff-based or a sleeve) used to stimulate the arm musculature and produce movement was identical to our previous studies ( Bouton et al., 2016; Friedenberg et al., 2017; Sharma et al., 2016; Skomrock et al., 2018; Schwemmer et al., 2018; Colachis et al., 2018; Bockbrader et al., 2019; Annetta et al., 2019 5.

Neurosci. 2018; 12 :763 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ). Details for the FES system: the cuff-based FES system consists of a multi-channel stimulator and a flexible cuff containing 130 electrodes that is wrapped around the participant’s forearm. During use, hydrogel disks (Axelgaard; Fallbrook, CA) were placed between the electrodes and skin to act as a conduction enhancer. The electrodes are 12 mm in diameter and were spaced at 22 mm intervals along the longitudinal axis of the forearm and 15 mm intervals in the transverse direction. Current-controlled, monophasic rectangular pulses (50 Hz pulse rate and 500 μs pulse width) were used to provide electrical stimulation and produce movement. Pulse amplitudes ranged from 0 to 20 mA and were updated every 100 ms. Stimulator calibrations were performed for a given movement using an anatomy-based trial-and-error method to determine appropriate electrode spatial patterns.
All methods below are separated into either passive sensory stimulation or active object touch experiments. All experiments were performed across a total of approximately 1.75 years.
All neural recordings were analyzed offline using MATLAB 2016b (The MathWorks). Following stimulation artifact removal (see Common Methods above), the signal was band-passed filtered (3 rd order Butterworth filter; 300 – 3000 Hz). Multi-unit activity was classified offline using superparamagnetic clustering (Wave clus, Quiroga et al., 2004 67. Quiroga, R.Q. ∙ Nadasdy, Z. ∙ Ben-Shaul, Y. Unsupervised spike detection and sorting with wavelets and superparamagnetic clustering Neural Comput. 2004; 16 :1661-1687 Crossref Scopus (1519) PubMed Google Scholar ). Unit clusters were manually inspected ( Figures S1 D and S1E), similar to our previous studies ( Ganzer et al., 2013; Manohar et al., 2017 30. Ganzer, P.D. ∙ Moxon, K.A. ∙ Knudsen, E.B. ... Serotonergic pharmacotherapy promotes cortical reorganization after spinal cord injury Exp. Neurol. 2013; 241 :84-94 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar 55.

Cortex-dependent recovery of unassisted hindlimb locomotion after complete spinal cord injury in adult rats eLife. 2017; 6 :e23532 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ). This was done to affirm waveform quality and morphology. For each channel, the multi-unit neural activity was first binned (20 ms bin width). We calculated evoked responses on a channel by channel basis (total of 96 recording array channels). A peri-stimulus time histogram (PSTH) was constructed for a given channel using the binned neural data 1 s before and after the start of stimulation, averaged across all stimulation trials (example single channel PSTH: Figure S1 F). The magnitude of the evoked response was then quantified similar to our previous studies using PSTH-based analyses ( Ganzer et al., 2013; Manohar et al., 2017 30. Ganzer, P.D. ∙ Moxon, K.A. ∙ Knudsen, E.B. ... Serotonergic pharmacotherapy promotes cortical reorganization after spinal cord injury Exp. Neurol. 2013; 241 :84-94 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar 55. Manohar, A. ∙ Foffani, G. ∙ Ganzer, P.D. ... Cortex-dependent recovery of unassisted hindlimb locomotion after complete spinal cord injury in adult rats eLife. 2017; 6 :e23532 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ). Details on the PSTH analysis: for a given channel, a response was considered significant if 1) it exceeded an activation threshold set as the average background activity of the channel across all stimulation trials (evaluated from −1 to −0.02 s before the stimulus) plus three standard deviations ( Figure S1 F, horizontal gray dashed line), and 2) at least three bins were over the activation threshold. The response magnitude for a given channel was then quantified as the background-subtracted number of spikes within the post-stimulus window of the PSTH (0 – 1 s after the stimulus). The response magnitude for a given channel was zero if it did not meet the significance criteria listed above. The global response magnitude was then estimated using the average response magnitude across all array channels for the given condition. We report the global response magnitude (average spikes per channel; Figure 1 C; Figure S2 B). Global PSTHs are background subtracted and smoothed with a 1 st degree polynomial model for plotting purposes ( Figure 1 B; Figure S2 A).
A nonlinear support vector machine (SVM) classifier ( Friedenberg et al., 2016 28. Friedenberg, D.A. ∙ Bouton, C.E. ∙ Annetta, N.V. ... Big data challenges in decoding cortical activity in a human with quadriplegia to inform a brain computer interface Conf. Proc. IEEE Eng. Med. Biol. Soc. 2016; 2016 :3084-3087 PubMed Google Scholar ; Chang and Lin, 2011) was used to decode stimulus location for the passive sensory stimulation recordings at both the minimum and maximum stimulation intensity (referred to as a ‘passive sensory decoder’ in the results) (SVM hyperparameters: γ = 0.001, C = 1). A separate SVM model for each stimulation intensity was built with 5 classes: Rest, Forearm, Thumb, Index, and Middle (related to Figure 2 ). The input features for each model were calculated as follows: (1) We recorded neural activity and calculated MWP during ∼250 total stimuli for each stimulus intensity and skin location across ∼5 months; (2) MWP was standardized across blocks within each day to account for day-to-day variability; (3) For each skin stimulation trial, defined by 0.2 s before and 0.8 s after a given sensory stimulus (this epoch was chosen due to the robust neural modulation that occurs during this time period around the stimulus, see Figure 1 B, Figure S2 A), MWP was vectorized to a 960-feature vector (96 channels ∗ 10 bins; where each bin spanned 100 ms); The same MWP vectorization process was applied to 250 randomly selected 1 s samples of Rest data collected during spontaneous activity in the first 15 s of a given recording; and (4) For each class, the vectorized MWP was shuffled to remove any effect of stimulus order or recording time during the ∼5-month period and equally assigned to either training or testing data (∼125 trials per class for training; ∼125 trials per class for testing). We report SVM model performance as a confusion matrix (diagonal values = sensitivity; off-diagonal values = false positive rate). Sensitivity is calculated as the percentage of correctly predicted class labels for the targeted class (i.e., true positive rate). False positive rate is calculated as the percentage of incorrectly predicted class labels for a given off-target class. Rows represent the actual recorded class, while the columns represent the model’s predictions (related to Figure 2 ).
We trained SVM decoders to recognize active object touch events in real-time (referred to as a ‘touch decoder’ in the results) (specifically related to Figures 4 and 5 ). These decoders were trained using neural data recorded during active object touch, in contrast to the passive sensory decoders described above (see Decoding Passive Sensory Stimulation ). We used the can object, a part of the standard clinical grasp and release test battery (5.4 × 9.1 cm) ( Wuolle et al., 1994; Schwemmer et al., 2018; Colachis et al., 2018 18.

Hand Surg. 1994; 19 :209-342 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (156) PubMed Google Scholar ). For model training, we recorded 9 total cues of labeled touch data, with each cue consisting of a 6 s period. Cues were conveyed by a virtual hand on a computer monitor. Each cued period of touch data was bounded by rest cues with random durations between 5 to 6 s. For each touch cue period, the participant first moved his hand down onto and around the can object for 3 s, followed by a scripted object grip period for an additional 3 s, where FES triggered a more forceful grip. Therefore, touch decoder model training consisted of neural data during: 1) movement onto the object, 2) touch of the object, and finally 3) additional FES mediated touch. This touch decoder model was then tested on 4 cue types and rest periods to assess model performance during ‘touch’ and ‘no touch’ events. The participant separately completed the following cued events: (1) 3 s of natural touch of the object followed by 3 s FES mediated touch (‘Touch’), (2) 6 s of natural object touch (‘Touch’), (3) 6 s of identical movement without the object present (‘No Touch’), (4) 6 s of FES without the object present (‘No Touch’). Rest periods were also assessed, and consisted of 5 s Rest epochs randomly selected across all recordings. For this touch decoder testing, we report model responsiveness during the 4 cue types and rest, defined as the percentage of time the touch decoder output was above the activation threshold during the given period (activation threshold = 0.5; see Video S1 for exemplary touch decoder outputs during testing). This touch decoder was then used to trigger the closed-loop sensory feedback interface during the object manipulation experiments described below (see Function During Sensorimotor Demultiplexing section). In a subset of experiments, we also assessed touch decoder timing during simultaneous recording of applied force (related to Figure S4 ; force transducer interface: custom designed piezoresistive sensor pad (FlexiForce; Boston, MA) interfaced with an Arduino Mega 2560 board transferring force data to the PC).
Grip force was measured in a subset of experiments (related to Figures 6 B and 6C) using an array of twenty-two piezoresistive sensors (FlexiForce; Boston, MA) built into a 3D printed replicate of the can object, described above (5.4 × 9.1 cm; cartoon of the can object is shown in Figure 4 B and Figure 5 A) ( Wuolle et al., 1994; Schwemmer et al., 2018; Colachis et al., 2018 18.

This grip force measurement object was similar to grip force transducers from previous studies using force sensors built into customized objects ( Kao et al., 2014; Kalra et al., 2015; Pehlivan et al., 2014 46. Kalra, M. ∙ Rakheja, S. ∙ Marcotte, P. ... Measurement of coupling forces at the power tool handle-hand interface Int. J. Ind. Ergon. 2015; 50 :105-120 Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar 48.

Design and validation of the RiceWrist-S exoskeleton for robotic rehabilitation after incomplete spinal cord injury Rehabilitation Robotics and Human-Robot Interaction. 2014; 32 :1415-1431 Google Scholar ). The force sensors were evenly distributed around the cylindrical surface of the can where the participant grasped the object. Force sensors were interfaced with a Teensey 3.6 USB board ( PJRC.com , LLC; Sherwood, OR) for transferring data to the PC (10 Hz sampling frequency). Force measurements from each sensor were calibrated (3-point force calibration; Chatillion TCD225 Series Force Measurement System; Indianapolis, IN). We report total force applied across the total can surface during grip events ( Figures 6 B and 6C).
Different levels of touch and grip intensity were decoded from M1 activity (related to Figures 6 A–6C). Similar to our earlier experiments ( Figures 4 and 5 ), the SVM model was first trained and tested with controls ( Figure 6 A), and then used online during BCI control ( Figures 6 B and 6C). We trained SVM decoders to recognize different afferent touch and grip intensity levels across three classes: ‘Touch Alone’, ‘Touch & Low Grip’, and ‘Touch & High Grip’. We used the 3D printed replicate of the can object with embedded force sensors to measure grip force during trials. Training data was collected as follows: 1) ‘Touch & High Grip’ and ‘Touch & Low Grip’ cues consisted of the participant touching the can and passively experiencing FES for 5 s, at FES intensities of 12.6 mA and 9 mA, respectively; 2) ‘Touch & High Grip’ and ‘Touch & Low Grip’ cues were randomly shuffled and separated by periods of ‘Touch Alone’ that lasted 6-7 s; 3) To mimic long duration grip events, the participant’s hand remained in contact with the grip force sensing can during all training cues; 4) Only offline analyses included training with an additional control cue type (i.e., a 4 th class), ‘FES Alone’, that lacked object touch. ‘FES Alone’ cues spanned the FES intensities experienced above (# 1), but no object touch was present (similar to ‘FES Alone’ with no object touch in Figure 4 A). ‘FES Alone’ cues lasted 5 s to mimic the FES durations from # 1. We report model performance as a confusion matrix (diagonal values = sensitivity; off-diagonal values = false positive rate). Sensitivity is again calculated as the percentage of correctly predicted class labels for the targeted class (i.e., true positive rate). False positive rate is calculated as the percentage of incorrectly predicted class labels for a given off-target class. Rows represent the actual recorded class, while the columns represent the model’s predictions (related to Figure 6 A).
We recorded 12 ‘Touch & High Grip’, 12 ‘Touch & Low Grip’, 24 ‘Touch Alone’, and 12 ‘FES Alone’ cues. Decoder performance was appraised ( Figure 6 A) using a 50 / 50 train-test split across classes using SVM class weights to compensate for minor class imbalances (standardized across train and test data; three of the 96 recording channels were also removed due to a temporary hardware malfunction for data shown in Figure 6 A). The online touch and grip intensity decoder was then trained from the same dataset using a 75 / 25 train-test split to increase decoding robustness during online performance ( Figures 6 B and 6C). This decoder was used to control FES and autonomously adjust grip force during online experiments described below (see Touch Regulated Grip Intensity section).
Similar to our previous studies, we built motor decoders for manipulating the can object (a part of the grasp and release test; Wuolle et al., 1994; Schwemmer et al., 2018; Colachis et al., 2018 18. Colachis, 4th, S.C. ∙ Bockbrader, M.A. ∙ Zhang, M. ...

Hand Surg. 1994; 19 :209-342 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (156) PubMed Google Scholar ). Details on motor intention decoding: the participant was prompted to imagine performing a can grip and movement, using a virtual hand displayed on a computer monitor. Each motor cue lasted 3-4 s, and was bounded by rest cues with random durations between 5 and 6 s. During the initial motor cues, FES triggered the can grip. FES was controlled by the SVM motor decoder starting on the 4 th motor cue. This motor decoder model was updated during subsequent training cues until a sufficiently accurate model was built (accuracy > ∼80%). This motor decoder was then used to control FES during the object manipulation experiments described below (see Function During Sensorimotor Demultiplexing sections).
The sensory feedback interface consisted of 3 low-noise vibrotactile coin motors affixed to a velcro band wrapped around the participant’s right bicep (cartoon schematic in Figures 4 B and 5 A) (coin motor details: 12 mm diameter, 3.4 mm height, 2.6 G force output; Need for Power; Shenzhen, Guangdong, China). This interface was tethered to an Arduino Mega 2560 board to power and control vibrotactile sensory feedback (all 3 vibrotactile motors were either off, or turned on by the touch decoder at their max level: 2.6 G force). Sensory feedback interfaces targeting the skin over the biceps have been used in several sensory feedback studies and is well studied ( Meek et al., 1989; Patterson & Katz, 1992; Pylatiuk et al., 2006; Chatterjee et al., 2007 16.

Orthot. 2006; 18 :57-61 Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar ). Our pilot data confirm that the participant’s right bicep exhibited normal sensory function, and vibrotactile stimulation was recognized on 100% of stimuli. The interface was designed to ensure participant comfort during movement. The vibrotactile motors achieved maximum amplitude within 1 ms of controller signal initiation. All sensory feedback interface communication was also recorded. This sensory feedback interface was controlled by the touch decoders outlined above and was triggered in real time during the closed-loop sensory feedback tasks described below.
We assessed upper limb function across a battery of 4 clinical assessments under the supervision of a licensed physiatrist (relevant for Figures 4 and 5 ). The sensory feedback interface was placed on the participant’s right bicep during all assessments, and function was assessed across trials during either a ‘Control’ or ‘Demultiplexing With Sensory Feedback’ condition. The ‘Control’ condition consisted of functional testing without any vibrotactile sensory feedback. ‘Demultiplexing With Sensory Feedback’ consisted of on-demand touch decoder controlled sensory feedback for rapidly conveying hand touch events back to the user. The participant was blinded to the given condition before a series of assessment trials. All clinical assessments were performed across 2 clinical testing days. The trial counts and statistical tests are described in the QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS section.
The first clinical assessment was an extension of the monofilament testing described above (see Clinical Assessment of Sensory Function section; Kalsi-Ryan et al., 2012 47. Kalsi-Ryan, S. ∙ Curt, A. ∙ Verrier, M.C. ... Development of the Graded Redefined Assessment of Strength, Sensibility and Prehension (GRASSP): reviewing measurement specific to the upper limb in tetraplegia J. Neurosurg. Spine. 2012; 17 :65-76 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). A touch decoder was first constructed identical to that described above (see Decoding Active Touch Alone section). The palmar aspects of digits 1, 3, & 5 were next exposed to multiple trials of either 0.4, 2, 4, or 300 g of force using the monofilaments, in the absence of visual feedback ( Kirshblum et al., 2011 49. Kirshblum, S.C. ∙ Burns, S.P. ∙ Biering-Sorensen, F. ... International standards for neurological classification of spinal cord injury (revised 2011) J. Spinal Cord Med. 2011; 34 :535-546 Crossref Scopus (1682) PubMed Google Scholar ). Trial location and monofilament force level were randomized. This allowed us to map what hand dermatomes contributed to the activation of the touch decoder (digit 1 (thumb): C6; digit 3 (middle): C7 / C8; digit 5 (pinky): C8; Kalsi-Ryan et al., 2012; Lee et al., 2008 47. Kalsi-Ryan, S. ∙ Curt, A. ∙ Verrier, M.C. ...

Anat. 2008; 21 :363-373 Crossref Scopus (144) PubMed Google Scholar ). We assessed whether the touch decoder was activated following the application of a given stimulus using simultaneously recorded high-speed video. We report the lowest dermatome level the touch decoder was activated by during the monofilament assessment (e.g., palmar tactile stimulation to digits 3 & 5 repeatedly activated the touch decoder (dermatomes innervated by spinal level C7 / C8)).
The second clinical assessment was an extension of the Object Touch Detection test described above (see Clinical Assessment of Sensory Function section). The standardized large cylinder object was used ( Yozbatiran et al., 2008 88. Yozbatiran, N. ∙ Der-Yeghiaian, L. ∙ Cramer, S.C. A standardized approach to performing the action research arm test Neurorehabil. Neural Repair. 2008; 22 :78-90 Crossref Scopus (460) PubMed Google Scholar ). A touch decoder was first constructed identical to that described above (see Decoding Active Touch Alone & Decoding Motor Intention section). The participant was again blind-folded, and the object was placed between digits 1, 2, and 3 without touching the skin on randomized trials. Grip was triggered by FES during a shuffled series of ‘Demultiplexing With Sensory Feedback’ or ‘Control’ condition cues. Grip was activated for a duration of 3 s for a given trial. The participant then reported whether there was an object in his hand. Each grip trial was bounded by rest periods with random durations between 5 to 6 s. We again report Object Touch Detection as the percentage of trials the participant correctly identified there was an object present during grip (related to Figure 4 C).
The third clinical assessment consisted of the modified grasp and release test (GRT) only using the can object. A touch decoder and motor decoder were constructed identical to that described above (see Decoding Active Touch Alone & Decoding Motor Intention section). The participant was then cued to repeatedly grasp, move, and release the object during shuffled series of ‘Demultiplexing With Sensory Feedback’ or ‘Control’ condition trials. After each GRT trial, the participant reported his sense of agency (SoA) (i.e., “How in control did you feel of the movement and grip”?). The SoA score ranged from 0-100, similar to previous studies ( Obhi & Hall, 2011; Kumar et al., 2014 51. Kumar, N. ∙ Manjaly, J.A. ∙ Miyapuram, K.P. Feedback about action performed can alter the sense of self-agency Front. Psychol. 2014; 5 :145 Crossref Scopus (6) PubMed Google Scholar 61. Obhi, S.S. ∙ Hall, P. Sense of agency and intentional binding in joint action Exp. Brain Res. 2011; 211 :655-662 Crossref Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ) (0 = poor sense of control; 100 = perfect sense of control; related to Figure 5 C).
The fourth clinical assessment was a modified GRT again using only the can object (related to Figure 5 D). A touch decoder and motor decoder were constructed identical to that described above (see Decoding Active Touch Alone & Decoding Motor Intention section). The participant was instructed to repeatedly grasp, transfer, and release the can object onto an elevated platform as fast as possible during shuffled series of ‘Demultiplexing With Sensory Feedback’ or ‘Control’ condition trials. Each GRT assessment period consisted of two 60 s object transfer periods separated by a 20 s rest period. All GRT trials were recorded with high speed video for offline analysis. We quantified the number of objects successfully transferred and the object transfer times, similar to our previous studies ( Schwemmer et al., 2018; Colachis et al., 2018 18. Colachis, 4th, S.C. ∙ Bockbrader, M.A. ∙ Zhang, M. ... Dexterous Control of Seven Functional Hand Movements Using Cortically-Controlled Transcutaneous Muscle Stimulation in a Person With Tetraplegia Front. Neurosci. 2018; 12 :208 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar 73. Schwemmer, M.A. ∙ Skomrock, N.D. ∙ Sederberg, P.B. ... Meeting brain-computer interface user performance expectations using a deep neural network decoding framework Nat. Med. 2018; 24 :1669-1676 Crossref Scopus (101) PubMed Google Scholar ). A successful transfer started the moment the object was initially contacted by the hand and ended when the object was fully released onto the platform (no objects were dropped). We also assessed the interval between the touch decoder and motor decoder activations to examine the neurophysiological substrates of GRT performance with and without sensory feedback (high-speed video was also used in addition to decoder times to confirm touch and motor event start times). The touch decoder or motor decoder start times were calculated across GRT trials using the time each decoder crossed the device activation threshold (device activation threshold = 0.5). We report the interval (s) between the touch and motor decoder activations across testing conditions.
The participant also utilized touch and grip intensity decoding online for grip adjustment experiments (related to Figures 6 B and 6C; all data for Figure 6 was recorded during the same clinical session). The participant briefly initiated a given trial using motor intention to start FES and grasp the can object with built in grip force sensors. After that point, FES mediated grip was controlled solely by touch and grip intensity decoders. The participant was free to attend to other stimuli while the touch and grip intensity decoder modulated FES levels. There were two trial types: 1) ‘Touch & High Grip’ trials were initiated at 12.6 mA FES (identical to ‘Touch & High Grip’ cues during SVM training); 2) ‘Touch & Low Grip’ trials were initiated at 9 mA FES (identical to ‘Touch & Low Grip’ cues during SVM training). A prediction of ‘Touch & High Grip’ decreased FES and subsequent grip force, and a prediction of ‘Touch & Low Grip’ increased FES and subsequent grip force. The given FES change occurred at a rate of 0.1 mA per prediction bin (every 100 ms). The touch and grip intensity decoder was challenged to appropriately decrease (‘Touch & High Grip’ trials) or increase (‘Touch & Low Grip’ trials) FES and subsequent grip force solely based on decoded afferent touch and grip intensity activity from M1 in real-time (grip force data is reported during the initial adjustment and equilibration period; i.e., 1-7 s after trial initiation). We report average FES amplitude change and the grip force values across time (1 s averages; 3 rd degree polynomial fit included for Figures 6 B and 6C to show trends).
Normality tests were performed for each analysis to determine if parametric or nonparametric statistics should be used. All statistical tests were two-tailed unless otherwise noted and performed in MATLAB 2016b. An alpha level of 0.05 was accepted for significance unless Bonferroni corrections are noted. Trial counts are noted below or in the METHOD DETAILS section. Details of statistical scores and parameters are provided in the given Results section.
Effects of sensory stimuli on evoked M1 neural activity across skin locations were evaluated using separate one-way ANOVAs for the maximum ( Figure 1 C) and minimum ( Figure S2 B) stimulation intensities. The factor was skin location with 4 levels: forearm, thumb, index, and middle. Tukey’s post hoc test was used to determine differences in global response magnitude across skin locations. Independent samples t tests were used to determine the effects of sensory stimuli on evoked M1 neural activity for data recorded during stimulation of the contralateral and ipsilateral forearm and thumb (related to Figure S3 ).
Separate one-tailed independent samples t tests were used to determine if decoder performance values were above chance for the passive sensory stimulation data (confusion matrices, Figure 2 ) or the touch and grip intensity data (confusion matrix, Figure 6 A). Each given confusion matrix value was compared to a chance prediction level for statistical evaluation. Chance levels were generated by randomly permuting the data labels 10 times ( Ojala & Garriga, 2010 62. Ojala, M. ∙ Garriga, G. Permutation tests for studying classifier performance J. Mach. Learn. Res. 2010; 11 :1833-1863 Google Scholar ). Values from unrandomized label permutation were then compared with values from randomized label permutation. A Bonferroni corrected alpha value was used for significance (0.05 / number of comparisons). Differences in perceptual and decoder sensitivities were assessed using separate one-way ANOVAs for each of the 4 skin locations (related to Figure 3 ).
For the active object touch experiments, touch decoder responsiveness values were assessed using a one-way ANOVA (related to Figure 4 ). The factor was cue type with 4 levels: Object Touch & FES, Object Touch, FES alone, and Movement alone. Tukey’s post hoc test was used to determine differences in touch decoder responsiveness across cue type. Functional improvement assessments (related to Figure 5 ) were performed across 2 separate clinical testing days for the following total trial counts: object touch detection, 16 trials (for either the ‘Demultiplexing With Sensory Feedback’ and ‘Control’ conditions); SoA, 24 trials (for either ‘Demultiplexing With Sensory Feedback’ and ‘Control’ conditions); modified GRT performance & decoder interval, 78 trials (‘Demultiplexing With Sensory Feedback’) and 72 trials (‘Control’). Effects of closed-loop sensory feedback were assessed using independent samples t tests for the object touch detection, SoA, GRT performance, and decoder interval data, comparing the ‘Demultiplexing With Sensory Feedback’ to ‘Control’ conditions.
Touch regulated grip intensity data was assessed using a slope test statistic (related to Figures 6 B and 6C). Touch regulated grip intensity was performed during 1 clinical testing day for the following trial counts: ‘Touch & High Grip’: 11 trials, ‘Touch & Low Grip’ trials: 14 trials.
