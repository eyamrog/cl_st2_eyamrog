Title: TDP-43 Triggers Mitochondrial DNA Release via mPTP to Activate cGAS/STING in ALS


Abstract: Summary

Cytoplasmic accumulation of TDP-43 is a disease hallmark for many cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), associated with a neuroinflammatory cytokine profile related to upregulation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and type I interferon (IFN) pathways. Here we show that this inflammation is driven by the cytoplasmic DNA sensor cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP)-AMP synthase (cGAS) when TDP-43 invades mitochondria and releases DNA via the permeability transition pore. Pharmacologic inhibition or genetic deletion of cGAS and its downstream signaling partner STING prevents upregulation of NF-κB and type I IFN induced by TDP-43 in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived motor neurons and in TDP-43 mutant mice. Finally, we document elevated levels of the specific cGAS signaling metabolite cGAMP in spinal cord samples from patients, which may be a biomarker of mtDNA release and cGAS/STING activation in ALS. Our results identify mtDNA release and cGAS/STING activation as critical determinants of TDP-43-associated pathology and demonstrate the potential for targeting this pathway in ALS.

Section: Introduction

TDP-43 is a nuclear DNA/RNA binding protein that is mutated in 4% of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) ( Kabashi et al., 2008 27. Kabashi, E. ∙ Valdmanis, P.N. ∙ Dion, P. ... TARDBP mutations in individuals with sporadic and familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Nat. Genet. 2008; 40 :572-574 Crossref Scopus (1299) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sreedharan et al., 2008 45. Sreedharan, J. ∙ Blair, I.P. ∙ Tripathi, V.B. ... TDP-43 mutations in familial and sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Science. 2008; 319 :1668-1672 Crossref Scopus (2129) PubMed Google Scholar ); however, its cytoplasmic accumulation is also observed in neurons of almost all patients with sporadic ALS and defines the major pathological subtype of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) ( Neumann et al., 2006 35. Neumann, M. ∙ Sampathu, D.M. ∙ Kwong, L.K. ... Ubiquitinated TDP-43 in frontotemporal lobar degeneration and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Science. 2006; 314 :130-133 Crossref Scopus (5033) PubMed Google Scholar ). Aside from two RNA binding domains, TDP-43 also encodes a nuclear localization sequence and nuclear export sequence, which mediate shuttling between the nucleus and cytosol, and a low-complexity glycine-rich region, which is where missense mutations (e.g., A315T, Q331K, or M337V) have been found to cause ALS ( Kabashi et al., 2008 27. Kabashi, E. ∙ Valdmanis, P.N. ∙ Dion, P. ... TARDBP mutations in individuals with sporadic and familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Nat. Genet. 2008; 40 :572-574 Crossref Scopus (1299) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sreedharan et al., 2008 45. Sreedharan, J. ∙ Blair, I.P. ∙ Tripathi, V.B. ... TDP-43 mutations in familial and sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Science. 2008; 319 :1668-1672 Crossref Scopus (2129) PubMed Google Scholar ). The C-terminal glycine-rich domain encodes a prion-like structure that can potentiate cytoplasmic aggregation ( Johnson et al., 2009 26. Johnson, B.S. ∙ Snead, D. ∙ Lee, J.J. ... TDP-43 is intrinsically aggregation-prone, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-linked mutations accelerate aggregation and increase toxicity J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284 :20329-20339 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (578) PubMed Google Scholar ). Recent studies demonstrate that ALS-associated mutations enhance TDP-43 accumulation not only in the cytoplasm but specifically within mitochondria ( Magrané et al., 2014 32. Magrané, J. ∙ Cortez, C. ∙ Gan, W.B. ... Abnormal mitochondrial transport and morphology are common pathological denominators in SOD1 and TDP43 ALS mouse models Hum. Mol.

The ALS disease-associated mutant TDP-43 impairs mitochondrial dynamics and function in motor neurons Hum. Mol. Genet. 2013; 22 :4706-4719 Crossref Scopus (230) PubMed Google Scholar , 2017 53.

Ther. 2017; 25 :127-139 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar ) and that preventing its translocation through the inner mitochondrial membrane can prevent neurotoxicity ( Wang et al., 2016 52. Wang, W. ∙ Wang, L. ∙ Lu, J. ... The inhibition of TDP-43 mitochondrial localization blocks its neuronal toxicity Nat. Med. 2016; 22 :869-878 Crossref Scopus (277) PubMed Google Scholar ). This appears to be a specific way in which mislocalized TDP-43 affects homeostasis of the cell and could have more far-reaching consequences for triggering immune response pathways.
ALS, and TDP-43-mediated neurodegeneration in general, has been associated with not only hyperinflammatory responses, such as nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)-related cytokines ( Egawa et al., 2012 17. Egawa, N. ∙ Kitaoka, S. ∙ Tsukita, K. ... Drug screening for ALS using patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells Sci. Transl. Med. 2012; 4 :145ra104 Crossref Scopus (444) PubMed Google Scholar ; Swarup et al., 2011 46. Swarup, V. ∙ Phaneuf, D. ∙ Dupré, N. ... Deregulation of TDP-43 in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis triggers nuclear factor κB-mediated pathogenic pathways J. Exp. Med. 2011; 208 :2429-2447 Crossref Scopus (263) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhao et al., 2015 60. Zhao, W. ∙ Beers, D.R. ∙ Bell, S. ... TDP-43 activates microglia through NF-κB and NLRP3 inflammasome Exp. Neurol. 2015; 273 :24-35 Crossref Scopus (164) PubMed Google Scholar ) but also with an elevated type I interferon (IFN) signature ( Wang et al., 2011 50. Wang, R. ∙ Yang, B. ∙ Zhang, D. Activation of interferon signaling pathways in spinal cord astrocytes from an ALS mouse model Glia. 2011; 59 :946-958 Crossref Scopus (66) PubMed Google Scholar ). Interestingly, these inflammatory signals precede overt symptoms in mouse models of the disease, which suggests that they participate in disease pathogenesis rather than simply acting as a marker of disease. Indeed, blockade of NF-κB appears to have some ability to reduce denervation in the neuromuscular junction and improve motor symptoms in TDP-43 (A315T) transgenic mice ( Swarup et al., 2011 46. Swarup, V. ∙ Phaneuf, D. ∙ Dupré, N. ... Deregulation of TDP-43 in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis triggers nuclear factor κB-mediated pathogenic pathways J. Exp. Med. 2011; 208 :2429-2447 Crossref Scopus (263) PubMed Google Scholar ). Despite these indications, there is currently no immune sensor proposed to detect cytoplasmic TDP-43 and trigger the inflammation observed in TDP-43 proteinopathies, laying the groundwork for this study.

Section: Results

To examine inflammation triggered by TDP-43, we employed inducible expression of empty vector (control [Ctrl]), wild-type (WT), or ALS mutant (Q331K) TDP-43 in a mouse neuronal cell line, which confirmed upregulation of NF-κB and type I IFN pathways in vitro ( Figures S1 A–S1C). To identify the innate immune sensor regulating this response, we repeated the in vitro model in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) genetically deficient for a panel of candidates that are known to regulate NF-κB and type I IFN production ( Figures 1 A, S1 D, and S1E). Because TDP-43 is an RNA binding protein, we first interrogated sensors of cytoplasmic RNA, including RIG-I and MDA-5 (via deletion of the conserved signaling adaptor MAVS) and PKR ( Figure 1 A). Surprisingly, absence of these innate immune sensors did not reduce NF-κB or type I IFN activation downstream of TDP-43 overexpression. Instead, deletion of cGAS, a sensor of cytoplasmic DNA, returned activation of these pathways to baseline ( Figure 1 A). cGAS signals via generation of a specific cyclic dinucleotide, cGAMP, which we could also detect in response to TDP-43 ( Figure S1 F). cGAMP then acts to trigger STING, which, as we confirmed using genetically deficient MEFs, also prevents TDP-43-induced inflammation ( Figure 1 A). We then made similar findings in human myeloid THP-1 cells, in which CRISPR-mediated deletion of STING led to significant attenuation of type I IFN and NF-κB pathways, as demonstrated by cytokine gene expression ( Figure 1 B) and activation of signaling molecules via western blot ( Figure 1 C). Next we looked to see whether pharmacological blockade of the pathway was feasible, using recently described inhibitors of cGAS (RU.521; Vincent et al., 2017 48. Vincent, J. ∙ Adura, C. ∙ Gao, P. ... Small molecule inhibition of cGAS reduces interferon expression in primary macrophages from autoimmune mice Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :750 Crossref Scopus (221) PubMed Google Scholar ) and STING (H-151; Haag et al., 2018 20. Haag, S.M. ∙ Gulen, M.F. ∙ Reymond, L. ... Targeting STING with covalent small-molecule inhibitors Nature. 2018; 559 :269-273 Crossref Scopus (623) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, these drugs prevented expression of IFNB1 and TNF in response to overexpressed WT and mutant TDP-43 ( Figure 1 D). We also confirmed activation of the cGAS/STING pathway in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived motor neurons (MNs) from ALS patients carrying familial mutations in TDP-43 ( Figures 1 E, 1F, and S1 G–S1I). Finally, we quantified the levels of cGAMP in spinal cord samples from sporadic ALS patients and compared these with samples from cases of progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) as a neurological control ( Figure 1 G). This documented a significant increase in cGAMP for the ALS samples independent of age, sex, or post-mortem interval ( Table S1 ). These results implicate cGAS as an important immune sensor regulating neuroinflammation associated with TDP-43 in ALS.
In sterile settings, cGAS can respond to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) of either mitochondrial ( Rongvaux et al., 2014 40. Rongvaux, A. ∙ Jackson, R. ∙ Harman, C.C. ... Apoptotic caspases prevent the induction of type I interferons by mitochondrial DNA Cell. 2014; 159 :1563-1577 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (616) PubMed Google Scholar ) or nuclear origin ( Ahn et al., 2014 1. Ahn, J. ∙ Ruiz, P. ∙ Barber, G.N. Intrinsic self-DNA triggers inflammatory disease dependent on STING J. Immunol. 2014; 193 :4634-4642 Crossref Scopus (138) PubMed Google Scholar ). To ascertain the source of DNA activating cGAS in response to TDP-43, we immunoprecipitated FLAG-tagged cGAS from HEK293T cells overexpressing WT or ALS mutant TDP-43 (A315T or Q331K; Figure S2 A), directly followed by qPCR for the detection of mitochondrial or nuclear DNA ( White et al., 2014 57. White, M.J. ∙ McArthur, K. ∙ Metcalf, D. ... Apoptotic caspases suppress mtDNA-induced STING-mediated type I IFN production Cell. 2014; 159 :1549-1562 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (691) PubMed Google Scholar ). This showed that, in response to TDP-43 overexpression, cGAS was bound to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) without evidence of the most abundant nuclear DNA sequences such as LINE1 elements or the ribosomal DNA RNA18S ( Figure 2 A). It is also possible to generate cell lines deficient for mtDNA (referred to as ρ 0 ) by culturing them with low-dose ethidium bromide (EtBr) ( Hashiguchi and Zhang-Akiyama, 2009 21. Hashiguchi, K. ∙ Zhang-Akiyama, Q.M. Establishment of human cell lines lacking mitochondrial DNA Methods Mol. Biol. 2009; 554 :383-391 Crossref Scopus (103) PubMed Google Scholar ). mtDNA depletion from THP-1 cells containing inducible WT and mutant TDP-43 was achieved in culture with EtBr for 3 weeks, as judged by qPCR of mitochondrial gene expression ( Figure S2 B). We then treated the cells with doxycycline (Dox) to induce TDP-43 (WT or Q331K), followed by quantification of inflammatory cytokine expression ( Figure 2 B), and activation of signaling pathways downstream of cGAS/STING ( Figure 2 C), which returned to baseline in the ρ 0 cells depleted of mtDNA. To ensure that EtBr treatment did not indirectly impair cGAS/STING signaling, we treated ρ 0 cells with cGAS/STING ligands, for which responses were not reduced ( Figures S2 C and S2D). Of note, we also achieved significant mtDNA depletion in human iPSC-MNs over a shorter course of 10 days of EtBr treatment ( Figure S2 E), after which cytokine expression and IFN production were consistently decreased ( Figures S2 F and S2G). Taking an independent approach, we imaged cells and observed leakage of mtDNA into the cytoplasm in response to overexpression of WT TDP-43, which was further augmented in cells with the ALS-associated mutant TDP-43 ( Figures 2 D–2F; Video S1 ). Consistent with earlier reports regarding mtDNA stress ( West et al., 2015 56. West, A.P. ∙ Khoury-Hanold, W. ∙ Staron, M. ... Mitochondrial DNA stress primes the antiviral innate immune response Nature. 2015; 520 :553-557 Crossref Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar ), nucleoid size was increased because of TDP-43 ( Figure S2 H); however, TFAM levels appear normal, and mtDNA copy numbers were not increased ( Figures S1 I and S2I). Therefore, we identified mtDNA leakage into the cytosol as the trigger for cGAS/STING activation because of TDP-43 and next queried mechanisms for TDP-43 entry into and mtDNA release from mitochondria.

TDP-43 Triggers mtDNA Release into the Cytoplasm, Related to Figure 2 Control MEFs or those overexpressing TDP-43 (WT or Q331K) were stained for TDP-43 (FLAG-tagged, red), mitochondrial inner membrane (TIM44, blue), mitochondrial outer membrane (TOM20, gray) and DNA (anti-DNA, green) then imaged by OMX-SR microscopy. This video demonstrates mtDNA release into the cytoplasm in response to TDP-43 proteinopathy.
Several studies now demonstrate the presence of TDP-43 in mitochondria using model systems and in ALS patient neurons post mortem ( Davis et al., 2018 12.

TDP-43 induces mitochondrial damage and activates the mitochondrial unfolded protein response PLoS Genet. 2019; 15 :e1007947 Crossref Scopus (161) PubMed Google Scholar ). Additionally, it has been reported that TDP-43 gains access to the mitochondrial matrix via the mitochondrial import inner membrane translocase TIM22 ( Wang et al., 2016 52. Wang, W. ∙ Wang, L. ∙ Lu, J. ... The inhibition of TDP-43 mitochondrial localization blocks its neuronal toxicity Nat. Med. 2016; 22 :869-878 Crossref Scopus (277) PubMed Google Scholar ). We confirmed this and found that TDP-43 (WT or Q331K) did not release mtDNA in cells deficient for the TIM22 subunit AGK ( Kang et al., 2017 28. Kang, Y. ∙ Stroud, D.A. ∙ Baker, M.J. ... Sengers Syndrome-Associated Mitochondrial Acylglycerol Kinase Is a Subunit of the Human TIM22 Protein Import Complex Mol. Cell. 2017; 67 :457-470.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (88) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figures 3 A–3D, S3 A, and S3B; Video S2 ). However, AGK has an additional function independent of the TIM22 translocase machinery, acting as a lipid kinase ( Kang et al., 2017 28. Kang, Y. ∙ Stroud, D.A. ∙ Baker, M.J. ... Sengers Syndrome-Associated Mitochondrial Acylglycerol Kinase Is a Subunit of the Human TIM22 Protein Import Complex Mol. Cell. 2017; 67 :457-470.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (88) PubMed Google Scholar ; Vukotic et al., 2017 49. Vukotic, M. ∙ Nolte, H. ∙ Konig, T. ...

Cell. 2017; 67 :471-483.e7 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (93) PubMed Google Scholar ). To ensure that the effect of TIM22 deletion was not an indirect effect of deficient lipid kinase activity, cells were reconstituted with mutant AGK(G126E), which cannot phosphorylate lipids. Similar to WT AGK, this mutant AGK, which lacks lipid kinase activity, still promoted mitochondrial localization of TDP-43 and the release of mtDNA ( Figures 3 A–3D). TIM22 normally functions to import multi-pass transmembrane proteins, which TDP-43 is not; however, it does possess several stretches of hydrophobic amino acids that in part resemble transmembrane domains ( Wang et al., 2016 52. Wang, W. ∙ Wang, L. ∙ Lu, J. ... The inhibition of TDP-43 mitochondrial localization blocks its neuronal toxicity Nat. Med. 2016; 22 :869-878 Crossref Scopus (277) PubMed Google Scholar ). Some of these hydrophobic motifs have been identified to be critical for the mitochondrial import of TDP-43 and lead to development of competitive peptide inhibitors based on the motif itself, fused to a viral TAT peptide to facilitate delivery into the cell. These competitive peptide inhibitors prevent the mitochondrial import of TDP-43 ( Wang et al., 2016 52. Wang, W. ∙ Wang, L. ∙ Lu, J. ... The inhibition of TDP-43 mitochondrial localization blocks its neuronal toxicity Nat. Med. 2016; 22 :869-878 Crossref Scopus (277) PubMed Google Scholar ), and we show that these inhibitors also prevent subsequent leakage of mtDNA into the cytosol of ALS patient iPSC-derived motor neurons ( Figures S3 C and S3D). Furthermore, these inhibitors are reported to have therapeutic benefits in mouse models of ALS driven by TDP-43 ( Wang et al., 2016 52. Wang, W. ∙ Wang, L. ∙ Lu, J. ... The inhibition of TDP-43 mitochondrial localization blocks its neuronal toxicity Nat. Med. 2016; 22 :869-878 Crossref Scopus (277) PubMed Google Scholar ), and that is consistent with their anti-inflammatory effect when we examined expression of IFNB1 and TNF in ALS patient iPSC-derived motor neurons ( Figure 3 E). As a comparison, we obtained iPSCs from ALS patients with repeat expansions in C9orf72 (C9-ALS), who are also known to develop TDP-43 pathology ( DeJesus-Hernandez et al., 2011 13. DeJesus-Hernandez, M. ∙ Mackenzie, I.R. ∙ Boeve, B.F. ... Expanded GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat in noncoding region of C9ORF72 causes chromosome 9p-linked FTD and ALS Neuron. 2011; 72 :245-256 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (3848) PubMed Google Scholar ), and with mutations in SOD1 (SOD1-ALS), which results in mitochondrial damage without any evidence of TDP-43 pathology ( Mackenzie et al., 2007 31. Mackenzie, I.R. ∙ Bigio, E.H. ∙ Ince, P.G. ... Pathological TDP-43 distinguishes sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with SOD1 mutations Ann. Neurol. 2007; 61 :427-434 Crossref Scopus (795) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tan et al., 2007 47. Tan, C.F. ∙ Eguchi, H. ∙ Tagawa, A. ... TDP-43 immunoreactivity in neuronal inclusions in familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with or without SOD1 gene mutation Acta Neuropathol. 2007; 113 :535-542 Crossref Scopus (261) PubMed Google Scholar ). Notably, the competitive TDP-43 inhibitors prevent IFNB1 and TNF expression and mtDNA leakage into the cytosol for C9orf72 but not SOD1 iPSC-derived motor neurons ( Figures S3 E and S3F). Together, these data document that mtDNA release into the cytosol and subsequent IFNB1 expression depends on hydrophobic motifs in TDP-43 and mitochondrial import regulated by AGK.

TDP-43 Import into Mitochondria Dependent on AGK, Related to Figure 3 HEK293T Flp-In control, AGK −/− , AGK −/− +WT or AGK −/− +G126E cells expressing TDP-43 (Q331K) were stained for TDP-43 (FLAG-tagged, red), mitochondrial inner membrane (TIM44, blue) and DNA (anti-DNA, green) then imaged by OMX-SR microscopy. This video demonstrates that TDP-43 entry into mitochondria requires AGK, independent of its lipid kinase function.
After confirming the mode of entry of TDP-43 into mitochondria, we sought to identify the mechanism for mtDNA release. It has been reported that TDP-43 is capable of inducing apoptosis under certain conditions, which could trigger Bak/Bax permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane and leakage of DNA into the cytoplasm ( McArthur et al., 2018 33. McArthur, K. ∙ Whitehead, L.W. ∙ Heddleston, J.M. ... BAK/BAX macropores facilitate mitochondrial herniation and mtDNA efflux during apoptosis Science. 2018; 359 :eaao6047 Crossref Scopus (596) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, in these assays, we did not see evidence of apoptosis, as indicated by cleaved caspase-3 ( Figure S4 A), and furthermore, the deletion of Bak/Bax had no effect on inflammatory cytokine gene expression in response to TDP-43 (WT or Q331K) ( Figures 4 A and S4 B). Instead, we observed hallmarks of mitochondrial destabilization, such as upregulation of ROS ( Figure 4 B) and loss of membrane potential (mΔψ) ( Figure S4 C) in ALS patient iPSC-derived motor neurons. Additionally, inhibiting mitochondrial ROS prevents inflammation in response to TDP-43 ( Figure S4 D). These observations potentially suggest destabilization and, thus, opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) ( Du et al., 2008 14. Du, H. ∙ Guo, L. ∙ Fang, F. ...

Chem. 2011; 286 :40184-40192 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (154) PubMed Google Scholar ), which can lead to mtDNA release ( García and Chávez, 2007 19. García, N. ∙ Chávez, E. Mitochondrial DNA fragments released through the permeability transition pore correspond to specific gene size Life Sci. 2007; 81 :1160-1166 Crossref Scopus (69) PubMed Google Scholar ). In agreement, pharmacological inactivation of the mPTP using cyclosporin A (CsA) prevented TDP-43(Q331K)-mediated mtDNA leakage into the cytoplasm ( Figures 4 C–4E, S4 E, and S4F; Video S3 ), thus attenuating IFNB1 expression ( Figure 4 F). This was also observed in patient iPSC-derived MNs ( Figures S4 I–S4K). Similarly, genetic deletion of Ppid (encoding the mPTP component PPID, also referred to as Cyclophilin D) ameliorated TDP-43-mediated mtDNA release into the cytoplasm ( Figures 4 G, S4 G, and S4H) and downstream inflammation ( Figure 4 H). Another mitochondrial component that may participate in release of mtDNA fragments because of oxidative stress is voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) ( Kim et al., 2019 29. Kim, J. ∙ Gupta, R. ∙ Blanco, L.P. ... VDAC oligomers form mitochondrial pores to release mtDNA fragments and promote lupus-like disease Science. 2019; 366 :1531-1536 Crossref Scopus (374) PubMed Google Scholar ). In agreement with this, we observed that the VDAC1 oligomerization inhibitor VBIT-4 prevents cytosolic accumulation of mtDNA and inflammation in ALS patient iPSC-derived motor neurons ( Figures S4 I–S4K). We also confirmed that genetic deletion of VDAC1 in MEFs prevents Ifnb1 and Tnf expression driven by overexpressed TDP-43 ( Figure S4 L). These MEF cell lines were obtained from a previous study ( Chin et al., 2018 9. Chin, H.S. ∙ Li, M.X. ∙ Tan, I.K.L. ... VDAC2 enables BAX to mediate apoptosis and limit tumor development Nat.

These in vitro data demonstrate a mechanism by which TDP-43 can mislocalize into mitochondria, opening the mPTP and resulting in VDAC1-dependent mtDNA leakage into the cytoplasm.

Inhibition of mPTP Prevents mtDNA Release due to TDP-43, Related to Figure 4 TDP-43-Q331K expressing MEFs were treated with CsA (12.5 μM) or DMSO as control, and stained for TDP-43 (FLAG-tagged, red), mitochondrial inner membrane (TIM44, blue), mitochondrial outer membrane (TOM20, gray) and DNA (anti-DNA, green), then imaged by OMX-SR microscopy. This video demonstrates that TDP-43-induced relocation of DNA from mitochondria into the cytoplasm was significantly reduced by inhibition of the mPTP.
To establish whether the cGAS/STING pathway is responsible for neuroinflammation in response to aberrant TDP-43 in vivo , we used the well-described murine model of ALS with human TDP-43 (p.A315T) overexpression in mice (referred to as Prp-TDP-43 Tg/+ ) ( Wegorzewska et al., 2009 55. Wegorzewska, I. ∙ Bell, S. ∙ Cairns, N.J. ... TDP-43 mutant transgenic mice develop features of ALS and frontotemporal lobar degeneration Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106 :18809-18814 Crossref Scopus (565) PubMed Google Scholar ). When given access to a jellified diet, this strain avoids early lethality because of gastrointestinal blockage and succumbs to symptoms of motor neuron degeneration at a median age of 148 days for males. We were also able to observe induction of inflammatory cytokines in bone marrow-derived macrophages, and IFNβ in the serum of mice with established disease ( Figures S5 A and S5B). More specifically, we were able to observe elevated levels of the cGAS signaling molecule cGAMP in the spinal cord and cortex of these mice on autopsy and also in the circulation of mice with established disease ( Figure 5 A). In agreement with the activation of cGAS/STING, we detected mtDNA in cytosolic lysates prepared from single-cell suspensions of Prp-TDP-43 Tg/+ mouse cortices or spinal cords ( Figures S5 C and S5D). Following this, we crossed the Prp-TDP-43 Tg/+ strain to Sting -deficient mice. Although we observed no difference in early disease onset, as determined by motor impairment ( Figure 5 B), progression of disease was slowed by 58% in Prp-TDP-43 Tg/+ Sting −/− mice ( Figure S5 E). Overall, this leads to a significant extension of the lifespan by 40% to a median of 208 days ( Figure 5 C) without decreasing the expression of TDP-43 ( Figure S5 F). Notably, deletion of only a single allele of Sting also afforded significant protection, with disease progression slowed by 37% ( Figure S5 E), and survival increased to a median of 173 days ( Figure 5 C). For patients with neurodegeneration associated with TDP-43, it would be essential to ameliorate disease symptoms. On day 120, we could observe that TDP-43 mutant mice were unable to maintain latency in the gold-standard “rotarod” test and suffered progressive deterioration of gait; however, mice deficient for Sting performed significantly better ( Figures 5 D and 5E). At this time point, deletion of Sting also significantly increased the distance traveled by TDP-43 mutant mice in an open field test and reduced their fractional time spent stationary ( Figures S5 G–S5I). Finally, we confirmed that the beneficial effect of deleting Sting in the Prp-TDP-43 Tg/+ model was associated with decreased neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Specifically, inflammatory type I IFN and NF-κB gene expression was no longer upregulated in the cortex and spinal cord ( Figure 5 F), and there was no longer a significant loss of neurons from cortical layer V, as quantified by Nissl body staining ( Figures 5 G and 5H). Therefore, loss of Sting results in a dramatic reduction in disease progression for an aggressive ALS-associated TDP-43 mutation in mice. The observation that deletion of only one allele of Sting also attenuates disease suggests that pharmacological inhibition of cGAS/STING could be clinically efficacious.
Interestingly, we observed that ALS patient iPSC-derived motor neurons had impaired survival 28 days after terminal differentiation, whereas control motor neurons were still predominantly viable ( Figures 6 A and 6B). Addition of the STING inhibitor H-151 during the final 28 days of culture prevented excess motor neuron death, suggesting a cell-intrinsic role of the cGAS/STING pathway ( Figures 6 A and 6B). Based on these results, we proceeded to test the STING inhibitor in vivo for the Prp-TDP-43 Tg/+ mouse model of ALS. Because we demonstrated that genetic deletion of Sting did not alter the onset of disease, we initiated treatment when symptoms were first observed on day 110. Following 28 days of treatment, we examined the expression of type I IFN and NF-κB genes, which were decreased significantly in the cortex and spinal cord ( Figure 6 C). We also quantified neurons in cortical layer V, whose loss was prevented by H-151 treatment ( Figures 6 D and 6E). These protective effects significantly ameliorate disease progression, as demonstrated by better performance in the rotarod test ( Figure 6 F). This administration regimen of a STING inhibitor at disease initiation provides hope that early intervention in patients could also provide a significant delay in neurodegeneration and highlights the translational potential of targeting this pathway in ALS.

Section: Discussion

Inflammation is gaining increased recognition for its role in neurodegeneration, and the cGAS/STING pathway is now specifically implicated in conditions such as Parkinson’s disease ( Sliter et al., 2018 44. Sliter, D.A. ∙ Martinez, J. ∙ Hao, L. ... Parkin and PINK1 mitigate STING-induced inflammation Nature. 2018; 561 :258-262 Crossref Scopus (878) PubMed Google Scholar ). STING can drive activation of NF-κB and type I IFN pathways, both of which are elevated in ALS and could contribute to progression of TDP-43-driven neurodegeneration. Our analysis of patient iPSC-derived motor neuron survival in vitro suggests that the role of STING is cell intrinsic; however, it is possible that there are additional roles of other cell types in the CNS in vivo . Studies with cell-type-specific deletion of STING or IFNAR in mouse models of ALS would help to elucidate this further. Interestingly, the adaptor protein downstream of STING, TBK1, is mutated and haploinsufficient in familial ALS ( Cirulli et al., 2015 10. Cirulli, E.T. ∙ Lasseigne, B.N. ∙ Petrovski, S. ..., FALS Sequencing Consortium Exome sequencing in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis identifies risk genes and pathways Science. 2015; 347 :1436-1441 Crossref Scopus (756) PubMed Google Scholar ; Freischmidt et al., 2015 18. Freischmidt, A. ∙ Wieland, T. ∙ Richter, B. ... Haploinsufficiency of TBK1 causes familial ALS and fronto-temporal dementia Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18 :631-636 Crossref Scopus (613) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, our data suggest that some TBK1 signaling must remain intact to initiate TDP-43-driven inflammation via cGAS/STING, although it may be that partial loss of TBK1 can ameliorate end-stage disease progression in a SOD1 mouse model ( Brenner et al., 2019 7. Brenner, D. ∙ Sieverding, K. ∙ Bruno, C. ... Heterozygous Tbk1 loss has opposing effects in early and late stages of ALS in mice J. Exp. Med. 2019; 216 :267-278 Crossref Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast, total deletion of TBK1 appears to trigger an entirely different pathway of RIPK1-dependent necroptosis, resulting in lethality ( Xu et al., 2018 59. Xu, D. ∙ Jin, T. ∙ Zhu, H. ... TBK1 Suppresses RIPK1-Driven Apoptosis and Inflammation during Development and in Aging Cell. 2018; 174 :1477-1491.e19 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (296) PubMed Google Scholar ).
TDP-43 entry into mitochondria appears to be highly conserved evolutionarily, with evidence of this in yeast ( Ruan et al., 2017 41. Ruan, L. ∙ Zhou, C. ∙ Jin, E. ... Cytosolic proteostasis through importing of misfolded proteins into mitochondria Nature. 2017; 543 :443-446 Crossref Scopus (330) PubMed Google Scholar ) and demonstrated for mice in vivo ( Davis et al., 2018 12. Davis, S.A. ∙ Itaman, S. ∙ Khalid-Janney, C.M. ... TDP-43 interacts with mitochondrial proteins critical for mitophagy and mitochondrial dynamics Neurosci. Lett. 2018; 678 :8-15 Crossref Scopus (103) PubMed Google Scholar )and in patients with ALS ( Wang et al., 2019 54. Wang, P. ∙ Deng, J. ∙ Dong, J. ... TDP-43 induces mitochondrial damage and activates the mitochondrial unfolded protein response PLoS Genet. 2019; 15 :e1007947 Crossref Scopus (161) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, in some contexts, mitochondrial localization of TDP-43 has not been observed ( Arnold et al., 2013 3. Arnold, E.S. ∙ Ling, S.C. ∙ Huelga, S.C. ... ALS-linked TDP-43 mutations produce aberrant RNA splicing and adult-onset motor neuron disease without aggregation or loss of nuclear TDP-43 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110 :E736-E745 Crossref Scopus (341) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hatzipetros et al., 2014 22. Hatzipetros, T. ∙ Bogdanik, L.P. ∙ Tassinari, V.R. ... C57BL/6J congenic Prp-TDP43A315T mice develop progressive neurodegeneration in the myenteric plexus of the colon without exhibiting key features of ALS Brain Res. 2014; 1584 :59-72 Crossref Scopus (72) PubMed Google Scholar ; White et al., 2018 58. White, M.A. ∙ Kim, E. ∙ Duffy, A. ... TDP-43 gains function due to perturbed autoregulation in a Tardbp knock-in mouse model of ALS-FTD Nat. Neurosci. 2018; 21 :552-563 Crossref Scopus (159) PubMed Google Scholar ). Generally, it appears that mouse models with lower levels of TDP-43 expression provide less evidence of cytoplasmic or mitochondrial TDP-43 localization, in agreement with less pronounced neurological phenotypes. The mouse model we employed represents the severe end of the phenotypic spectrum, associated with early lethality because of neurodegeneration in the myenteric plexus of the colon, leading to gastrointestinal dysfunction and death around 100 days of age unless the mice are fed a jellified diet ( Herdewyn et al., 2014 23. Herdewyn, S. ∙ Cirillo, C. ∙ Van Den Bosch, L. ... Prevention of intestinal obstruction reveals progressive neurodegeneration in mutant TDP-43 (A315T) mice Mol. Neurodegener. 2014; 9 :24 Crossref Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar ). On this diet, it has been observed that mice survive to develop the key hallmarks of neurodegeneration ( Coughlan et al., 2016 11. Coughlan, K.S. ∙ Halang, L. ∙ Woods, I. ... A high-fat jelly diet restores bioenergetic balance and extends lifespan in the presence of motor dysfunction and lumbar spinal cord motor neuron loss in TDP-43A315T mutant C57BL6/J mice Dis. Model. Mech. 2016; 9 :1029-1037 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ), including mitochondrial localization of TDP-43 ( Wang et al., 2019 54. Wang, P. ∙ Deng, J. ∙ Dong, J. ... TDP-43 induces mitochondrial damage and activates the mitochondrial unfolded protein response PLoS Genet. 2019; 15 :e1007947 Crossref Scopus (161) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our in vitro data suggest that this leads to increased mtROS, associated with opening of the mPTP and leakage of mtDNA in a VDAC1-dependent process that is independent of Bak/Bax. Moreover, our results confirm that endogenous levels of TDP-43 drive cytoplasmic accumulation of mtDNA and cGAS/STING activation in ALS patient iPSC-derived motor neurons and spinal cord samples.
This work identifies a novel mechanism by which neuroinflammation is triggered in TDP-43 proteinopathies. Our assessment of cells lines, a mutant TDP-43 mouse model, and human ALS-affected spinal cord samples provides support for a model where TDP-43 liberates mtDNA into the cytoplasm via the mPTP to activate cGAS/STING signaling. Given that a range of cGAS and STING inhibitors have been developed recently ( Haag et al., 2018 20. Haag, S.M. ∙ Gulen, M.F. ∙ Reymond, L. ... Targeting STING with covalent small-molecule inhibitors Nature. 2018; 559 :269-273 Crossref Scopus (623) PubMed Google Scholar ; Vincent et al., 2017 48. Vincent, J. ∙ Adura, C. ∙ Gao, P. ... Small molecule inhibition of cGAS reduces interferon expression in primary macrophages from autoimmune mice Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :750 Crossref Scopus (221) PubMed Google Scholar ), including those which we have shown here to prevent TDP-43-induced inflammation, it should be possible to determine whether targeting this pathway can improve the symptoms of neuronal decline in patients with disease involving TDP-43 proteinopathy.

Sting +/− mice on the congenic C57BL/6 background were crossed with Prp-TDP-43 Tg/+ mice to create Prp-TDP-43 Tg/+ Sting +/− , and further crossed with other non-littermate mice of the same genotype in order to generate the offspring of Prp-TDP-43 T/+ Sting +/+ , Prp-TDP-43 Tg/+ Sting +/− and Prp-TDP-43 Tg/+ Sting −/− . All animals analyzed in this study were males. Care of the Prp-TDP-43 Tg/+ male mice was adapted from previously described methods ( Becker et al., 2017 6. Becker, L.A. ∙ Huang, B. ∙ Bieri, G. ... Therapeutic reduction of ataxin-2 extends lifespan and reduces pathology in TDP-43 mice Nature. 2017; 544 :367-371 Crossref Scopus (385) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition to regular chow, all male mice were given DietGel Boost (ClearH 2 O) in a cup on the floor of the cage from day 30 until the experiment endpoint to ensure that the impaired mice could easily access their food and water. The mice were weighed and visually checked for an ALS phenotype by animal technicians daily until they reached the euthanasia endpoint of severe motor dysfunction (see gait impairment scoring). Animal motor assessment was conducted in mice aged 120-130 days. Mice were genotyped using primers listed in the Key Resources Table . Animal procedures were approved by the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute Animal Ethics Committee (Ethics application: 2017.029).

THP-1 cells were cultured in this medium for 3 weeks and then rested for an additional 2 weeks in the presence of uridine to achieve mtDNA-depleted cells. Human iPSC-derived motor neurons were treated in a similar way, except a lower dose of 50 ng/mL ethidium bromide was used. The depletion was analyed using real-time qPCR to measure expression of mitochondrial genes or nuclear genes. The primer sequences used are provided in the Key Resources Table .
We generated STING CRISPR−/− THP-1 cells and Ppid CRISPR−/− MEFs as described previously ( Baker and Masters, 2018 4. Baker, P.J. ∙ Masters, S.L. Generation of Genetic Knockouts in Myeloid Cell Lines Using a Lentiviral CRISPR/Cas9 System Methods Mol. Biol. 2018; 1714 :41-55 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ). Third generation lentiviral transduction was performed to generate cells expressing Cas9 fused to mCherry or blasticidin ressitance gene, which were subjected to positive selection via FACS sorting or antibiotic treatment for 2 weeks respectively. Doxycycline-inducible sgRNAs were cloned using a pFgH1tUT (BFP tagged) plasmid and subsequently transduced into the target cells expressing Cas9. Cells were treated with doxycycline for 72 hours and then rested for an additional 48 hours prior to experiments. Gene disruption was confirmed by immunoblot analysis of target proteins and functional analysis. The targeting guide sequences are provided in the Key Resources Table . Gene deletion was then confirmed by western blot and functional analysis.
Third generation lentiviral constructs including pSLIK-Neo (vector), hTDP-43 WT and Q331K were used to generate lentivirus as described ( Balka et al., 2020 5. Balka, K.R. ∙ Louis, C. ∙ Saunders, T.L. ... TBK1 and IKKε Act Redundantly to Mediate STING-Induced NF-κB Responses in Myeloid Cells Cell Rep. 2020; 31 :107492 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (228) PubMed Google Scholar ; Moghaddas et al., 2018 34. Moghaddas, F. ∙ Zeng, P. ∙ Zhang, Y. ... Autoinflammatory mutation in NLRC4 reveals a leucine-rich repeat (LRR)-LRR oligomerization interface J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2018; 142 :1956-1967.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ). HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with pSLIK plasmids, pMDL (packaging), RSV-REV (packaging) and VSVg (envelope) using Lipofectamine 2000 diluted in OptiMEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to generate lentiviral particles. The cell culture supernatant was collected 48 hours later and filtured through 0.45 mm filteres prior to transduction, for which 5x10 5 target cells were centrifuged with the lentivirus in the presence of polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich) at 839 x g for 3 hours at 32°C and cultured at 37°C overnight. Transduced cells were subsequently subjected to antibiotic selection with G418 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to generate stable cell lines carrying doxycycline-inducable 3xFLAG-tagged (N’) and Myc-tagged (C’) TDP-43.
The constructs pGW1-hTDP-43 A315T or Q331K obtained via site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange Lightning Kit (Agilent Technologies) using the oligonucleotide primers listed in the Key Resources Table . The mutagenesis was confirmed via Sanger Sequencing.
Transfection of MEFs was performed using FuGENE HD (Promega) at a transfection reagent:DNA ratio of 3:1 for 48 hours. For HEK293T cells, Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies) was used for 24 hours according to manufacturer’s instructions.
Differentiation of iPSCs into MNPs was performed as described previously ( Du et al., 2015 15. Du, Z.W. ∙ Chen, H. ∙ Liu, H. ... Generation and expansion of highly pure motor neuron progenitors from human pluripotent stem cells Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 :6626 Crossref Scopus (277) PubMed Google Scholar ). Human iPSCs were cultured in a chemically defined Neural Medium: DMEM/F12:Neurobasal (1:1) supplemented with 0.5x N-2, 0.5x B-27, 0.1mM L-ascorbic acid, 1x Glutamax and 1x Primocin containing 3 μM CHIR99021, 2 μM Dorsomorphin and 2 μM SB431542 37°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO 2 for 6 days for induction of neuroepithelial progenitors (NEPs). The NEPs were dissociated with ReLeSR as per manufacturer’s instruction and cultured 1:6 on Matrigel-coated plates in the Neural Medium containing 1 μM CHIR99021, 2 μM Dorsomorphin and 2 μM SB431542 for 6 days for induction of MNPs. Y-27632 was used for the first 24 hours, and the medium was changed every other day. At this stage of differentiation, MNPs were either expanded in the Neural Medium containing 3 μM CHIR99021, 2 μM Dorsomorphin, 2 μM SB431542, 0.1 μM all-trans retinoic acid (RA), 0.5 μM Purmorphamine (Pur) and 0.5 mM Valproic Acid prior to differentiation of motor neuron or cryopreserved in the same medium containing additional 10% DMSO. All medium and reagents used are listed in the Key Resources Table .
The MNPs were dissociated with Accutase and cultured on Matrigel-coated plates in the Neural Medium containing 0.5 μM all-trans RA and 0.1 μM Pur for 6 days into premature MNX1 + MN. Y-27632 was used for the first 24 hours. Subsequently, cells were detached with Accutase to generate a single cell suspension and matured in the medium supplemented with 0.1 μM Compound E for 10 days into ChAT + MNs. The medium was replaced every other day for both stages of differentiation. Cell markers of motor neurons, including MNX1, ChAT and βIII-Tubulin, were confirmed using an inverted SP8 confocal microscopy (Leica) or quantitative real-time PCR. The antibodies and primers used are provided in the Key Resources Table .
MEF cell lines expressing Dox-induced FLAG-tagged TDP-43 were seeded onto glass coverslips (18mm x 18mm, thickness 1½, Zeiss) for the indicated times and prepared for imaging as previously described ( McArthur et al., 2018 33. McArthur, K. ∙ Whitehead, L.W. ∙ Heddleston, J.M. ... BAK/BAX macropores facilitate mitochondrial herniation and mtDNA efflux during apoptosis Science. 2018; 359 :eaao6047 Crossref Scopus (596) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, cells were fixed in ice-cold methanol/acetone containing 0.1% Glutaraldehyde, blocked and incubated in 3% normal goat serum/0.1% Triton X-100 overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies as follows: anti-FLAG tag, anti-DNA and anti-TIM44 in blocking buffer. Following two washes in 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS and one hour incubation with secondary antibodies (goat anti-rabbit AF568, goat anti-mouse AF488 and goat anti-rat AF405). After an additional probing with anti-TOM20 AF647 overnight at 4°C, coverslips were mounted onto the microscopy slide using Prolong Diamond Antifade Mountant (Thermo Fisher Scientific). HEK293T cells were seeded onto poly-L-lysine-coated coverslips and stained with anti-Myc tag and other antibodies listed above. Four color imaging was performed on the OMX-SR system (GE Healthcare) using a 60Å∼1.42 NA oil immersion lens (Olympus). Three-dimensional surface construction and zoom-in snapshots of selected regions were created using Imaris software (v9.12). For quantification, the nuclear region was removed and any cells at the edge of the ROI was cropped out, surfaces were created for the DNA and TDP-43 channels. This approach allows spatial calculation of the proportion of DNA or TDP-43 regions overlapped or dissociated with the mitochondrial channels, such as TIM44 and TOM20, using Imaris software.
At day 110, Prp-TDP-43 Tg/+ mice were injected with H-151 (210 μg) or an equivalent amount of DMSO in 200 μL PBS+10% Tween80 by intraperitoneal injection three times a week for a total 4-week treatment course. To minimize the impact, IP injections were rotated around the 4 quadrants of the abdomen, so that the same region was only injected twice, 4 days apart. No adverse reactions were observed during the treatment.
We collected data for gait impairment in each mouse line using adapted or previously described methods ( Becker et al., 2017 6. Becker, L.A. ∙ Huang, B. ∙ Bieri, G. ... Therapeutic reduction of ataxin-2 extends lifespan and reduces pathology in TDP-43 mice Nature. 2017; 544 :367-371 Crossref Scopus (385) PubMed Google Scholar ). Scoring was performed blinded to the genotype twice a week by animal technicians until the humane euthanasia end point or at day 300. Taken briefly, a score of 0 was given to the mouse with no motor impairment; a score of 1 was given to the mouse with a tremor while walking; a score of 2 was given to the mouse displaying a lowered pelvis and swimming gait while moving forward; a score of 3 was given to the mouse struggling to move forward and dragging its abdomen on the ground; a score of 4 marked the euthanasia end point in which the mouse failed to upright itself within 30 s. The scoring was interpreted for the slope of the linear regression across the lifespan per mouse, indicating progression of ALS-associated motor dysfunction.
Motor co-ordination and balance was measured using a rotating rod (Rotamex-5, Columbus Instruments). It measured the time (latency) it takes the mouse to fall off the apparatus accelerating from 4 to 40 rpm in 288 s (1 rpm/8 s). All mice at day 120-130 received a 3-day training course with three trials a day prior to the assay. On the day of testing, mice were kept in their cages and acclimatised to the procedure room for at least 15 minutes. The test phase consists of three trials separated by 15-minute intervals to avoid habituation, and the average of three trials was taken into data analysis.
To quantify differences in generalized locomotor activity, mice were subjected to the OF test as previously described ( Samson et al., 2015 43. Samson, A.L. ∙ Ju, L. ∙ Ah Kim, H. ... MouseMove: an open source program for semi-automated analysis of movement and cognitive testing in rodents Sci. Rep. 2015; 5 :16171 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, mice at day 120-130 were placed in the center of a custom-built circular arena with a white melamine floor (diameter: 90cm) and black plastic wall (height: 39cm). This was performed in a quiet (∼50 dB) and dimly lit (∼35 lux) room. The OF was wiped clean with 70% ethanol and allowed to dry between test sessions to minimize olfactory cues. The movement of each mouse in the OF was video captured using an overhead HD C615 webcam (Logitech) and then a detailed analysis of movement was performed using Fiji and MouseMove ( Samson et al., 2015 43. Samson, A.L. ∙ Ju, L. ∙ Ah Kim, H. ... MouseMove: an open source program for semi-automated analysis of movement and cognitive testing in rodents Sci. Rep. 2015; 5 :16171 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Brains and spinal cords were collected from mice following cardiac perfusion with PBS. For cytokine profiling, tissues were homogenized using metal beads at 30Hz for 90 s in 1 mL Trizol (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with a TissueLyser II (QIAGEN) then total RNA was isolated for qPCR. For immunochemistry, mice were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) after perfusion with PBS. Tissues were then immersed in 4% PFA for 3 days, cryoprotected and embedded for cryosection (7 μm). Cresyl violet was used to stain Nissl bodies as a marker to compare neuronal density in cortical layer V measured using the ‘Analyze Particles’ feature of Fiji and present as neurons/mm 2 .
Cells were lysed in 1x RIPA buffer for total lysis (20mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, 10 mM NaPPi, 5 mM NaF and 1 mM Na 3 VO 4 ) or in 0.025% digitonin/MELB buffer (20 mM HEPES/KOH, pH 7.5, 250 mM sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl 2 ) for cytosolic lysis unless otherwise stated in the specific figure legends. All cell lysis buffers were supplemented with 1 mM PMSF and cOmplete protease inhibitors (Roche Biochemicals). RIPA-lysed samples were processed through Pierce centrifuge columns (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to remove DNA. Following addition of reducing SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer (1.25% SDS, 12.5% glycerol, 62.5mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 0.005% bromophenol blue, 50mM dithiothreitol) and denaturation at 95°C for 10 min, samples were separated on Novex 4%–12% precast SDS-PAGE gels (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with MES running buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and subsequently transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Millipore). Membranes were blocked in 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 0.1% Tween 20 before overnight incubation with specific primary antibodies at 4°C. All listed primary antibodies were used at 1:1000 unless otherwise stated in the specific figure legends. Membranes were then washed and incubated with appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies, developed immunoreactivity (Chemiluminescent HRP substrate, Millipore) and imaged using the ChemiDoc Touch Imaging System (BioRad).
Following induction of TDP-43 for the time indicated, cell lysates were prepared similarly to a previously published protocol ( West et al., 2015 56. West, A.P. ∙ Khoury-Hanold, W. ∙ Staron, M. ... Mitochondrial DNA stress primes the antiviral innate immune response Nature. 2015; 520 :553-557 Crossref Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar ). Approximately 10 × 10 6 HEK293T cells or MEFs were lysed at 4°C for 10 min with 1 mL of 0.025% digitonin/MELB buffer. Cell lysates were centrifuged twice at 13,000 x g for 5 minutes at 4°C to separate the soluble fraction from a pellet that contains the heavy membrane fraction. Human iPSC-derived motor neurons were lysed in 0.0045% digitonin/MELB buffer instead. Immunoprecipitation of FLAG-tagged mouse cGAS (pMIH-FLAG-mmcGAS) was performed using anti-FLAG M2 affinity Gel. Samples were incubated at 4°C for 2 hours on a rotator, washed extensively and then subjected to DNA extraction using a NucleoSpin Tissue XS kit (Macherey-NaGel). Quantification of coprecipitated DNA was performed similarly to previously described protocol ( White et al., 2014 57. White, M.J. ∙ McArthur, K. ∙ Metcalf, D. ... Apoptotic caspases suppress mtDNA-induced STING-mediated type I IFN production Cell. 2014; 159 :1549-1562 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (691) PubMed Google Scholar ). Alternatively, half the cells were subjected to cytoplasmic lysis (digitonin), while the other half were subjected to total cell lysis in RIPA buffer. DNA was then purified and analyzed by real-time PCR as relative expression to Gapdh (mouse cells) or ACTIN (Human cells) in total lysis, presented as the ratio of cytosolic compared to overall input of total cell lysis.
Cortex and spinal cords were collected from symptomatic Prp-TDP-43 Tg/+ mice or healthy littermate controls following cardiac perfusion with PBS. Separate CNS tissues were passed through 100 μm nylon mesh and followed by incubation with TrypLE Express (GIBCO) at 37°C for 20 mins. Cortical and spinal cords homogenates were mechanically dissociated by trituration and passed through 70 μm nylon mesh. Cells were washed in PBS and were further subjected to 30% Percoll density gradient centrifugation at 300 x g at 22°C for 20 mins in order to separate myelin from viable cellular fraction. Cells were subsequently processed for subcellular fractionation and DNA analysis as described above.
Total RNA was isolated using the ISOLATE II RNA Mini Kit (Bioline) as per manufacturer’s instructions and reverse transcribed to cDNA using oligo(dT) nucleotides and SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using SYBR Green/ROX qPCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) on a ViiA 7 Real-Time PCR system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cytokine expression from qPCR is represented as gene expression relative to Hprt/HPRT as ΔCt. Where indicated, relative gene expression in TDP-43 WT or mutant overexpressing cells was further normalized to expression in vector control transfected/overexpressed cells of the same genotype in the same experiment and represented as fold change. Primers were designed using the Integrated DNA Technologies online tool and listed in the Key Resources Table .
Serum from the Prp-TDP-43 Tg/+ mice or cell culture supernatants were analyzed for IFNβ and IP-10 protein for the time indicated. Levels of cGAMP in cell lysates, murine serum and CNS tissues from Prp-TDP-43 Tg/+ mice and ALS patients were measured by 2′3′-cGAMP competitive ELISA Kit (Cayman Chemical). For sample preparation, cells were lysed in M-PER™ Mammalian Protein Extraction Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) whereas CNS tissues were homogenized in 80% methanol, centrifuged at 21,000 x g for 5 minutes at 4°C to remove debris, and then the soluble fraction was freeze-dried before resuspension in PBS.
Human iPSC-derived MNs were detached with Accutase to generate single cell suspension washed in 1 mL of warm Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) And centrifuged at 200 x g for 3 minutes at room temperature with a low brake (3). Cells were incubated with MitoSOX™ Red (mitochondrial ROS production) or TMRM dye (mitochondrial membrane potential mΔψ) as previously described ( Wang et al., 2016 52. Wang, W. ∙ Wang, L. ∙ Lu, J. ... The inhibition of TDP-43 mitochondrial localization blocks its neuronal toxicity Nat. Med. 2016; 22 :869-878 Crossref Scopus (277) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhou et al., 2011 61. Zhou, R. ∙ Yazdi, A.S. ∙ Menu, P. ... A role for mitochondria in NLRP3 inflammasome activation Nature. 2011; 469 :221-225 Crossref Scopus (4138) PubMed Google Scholar ) for 10 minutes at 37°C in dark. Following three gentle washes in warm HBSS, stained neurons were resuspended in warm FACS buffer (PBS/1% FBS) and analyzed by flow cytometry (BD LSRFortessa X-20). The staining was acquired using the Y585/15 filter and analyzed for Median Fluorescence Intensity (MFI) using FlowJo software.
Data are typically mean ± SEM and analyzed by t test between two groups or one- or two-way ANOVA followed by a Sidak, Tukey or Dunnett multiple comparison test as appropriate. GraphPad Prism 8 was used to generate all charts and statistical analyses. A P value < 0.05 was considered significant.
