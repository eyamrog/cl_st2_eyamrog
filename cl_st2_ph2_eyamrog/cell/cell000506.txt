Title: Neoantigen-driven B cell and CD4 T follicular helper cell collaboration promotes anti-tumor CD8 T cell responses


Abstract: Summary

CD4 T follicular helper (TFH) cells support B cells, which are critical for germinal center (GC) formation, but the importance of TFH-B cell interactions in cancer is unclear. We found enrichment of TFH cell transcriptional signature correlates with GC B cell signature and with prolonged survival in individuals with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). We further developed a murine LUAD model in which tumor cells express B cell- and T cell-recognized neoantigens. Interactions between tumor-specific TFH and GC B cells, as well as interleukin (IL)-21 primarily produced by TFH cells, are necessary for tumor control and effector CD8 T cell function. Development of TFH cells requires B cells and B cell-recognized neoantigens. Thus, tumor neoantigens can regulate the fate of tumor-specific CD4 T cells by facilitating their interactions with tumor-specific B cells, which in turn promote anti-tumor immunity by enhancing CD8 T cell effector functions.

Section: Introduction

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, accounting for ∼1.8 million deaths annually ( Bray et al., 2018 9. Bray, F. ∙ Ferlay, J. ∙ Soerjomataram, I. ... Global cancer statistics 2018: GLOBOCAN estimates of incidence and mortality worldwide for 36 cancers in 185 countries CA Cancer J. Clin. 2018; 68 :394-424 Google Scholar ). Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most common form of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC; 40% of cases), and is most frequently associated with mutations in KRAS proto-oncogene (30% of cases) ( Schabath and Cote, 2019 123. Schabath, M.B. ∙ Cote, M.L. Cancer Progress and Priorities: Lung Cancer Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev. 2019; 28 :1563-1579 Google Scholar ). Traditionally, therapeutic options for KRAS mutant LUAD have been limited, but the successful application of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) targeting the PD-1 pathway has changed the therapeutic landscape ( Ettinger et al., 2019 32. Ettinger, D.S. ∙ Wood, D.E. ∙ Aggarwal, C. ..., OCN NCCN Guidelines Insights: Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer, Version 1.2020 J. Natl. Compr. Canc.

Therapy for Stage IV Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer Without Driver Alterations: ASCO and OH (CCO) Joint Guideline Update J. Clin. Oncol. 2020; 38 :1608-1632 Google Scholar ). The success of PD-1-blockade therapy has also changed the perception that LUAD is a non-immunogenic cancer type, because anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment potentiates the function of previously activated T cells, suggesting that therapy-responsive LUAD individuals had potent, ongoing anti-tumor immune responses at the time of therapy administration ( Forde et al., 2018 35.

Yet, only ∼20% of LUAD individuals benefit from ICB ( Gandhi et al., 2018 39. Gandhi, L. ∙ Rodríguez-Abreu, D. ∙ Gadgeel, S. ..., KEYNOTE-189 Investigators Pembrolizumab plus Chemotherapy in Metastatic Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer N. Engl. J.

Med. 2016; 375 :1823-1833 Google Scholar ) and improving response rates will require a better understanding of the anti-tumor immune response, including how different types of tumor-infiltrating T cells interact with other immune cells and contribute to anti-tumor immunity.
A growing body of evidence has highlighted the potential importance of CD4 T helper (Th) cells and B cells in cancer and immunotherapy ( Alspach et al., 2019 2.

In non-cancer contexts, TFH cells provide necessary help for B cell maturation and function, and in a wide range of human cancers, the presence of B cells and TFH cells is correlated with prolonged survival and favorable therapeutic responses ( Bindea et al., 2013 6.

This correlation is especially strong when TFH cells and B cells are located in tumor-associated tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs), because these structures could facilitate TFH-B cell interactions with subsequent effector functions in tumors ( Rakaee et al., 2021 111.

B cells, plasma cells and antibody repertoires in the tumour microenvironment Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2020; 20 :294-307 Google Scholar ). Yet, the functional importance of tumor-specific TFH cells remains uncertain, as does the importance of their interactions with B cells.
T cell-B cell interactions are necessary for the proper development and function of TFH cells and germinal center (GC) B cells in infection, vaccine responses, and autoimmune diseases ( Crotty, 2019 22. Crotty, S. T Follicular Helper Cell Biology: A Decade of Discovery and Diseases Immunity. 2019; 50 :1132-1148 Google Scholar ; Cyster and Allen, 2019 23. Cyster, J.G. ∙ Allen, C.D.C. B Cell Responses: Cell Interaction Dynamics and Decisions Cell. 2019; 177 :524-540 Google Scholar ). In canonical T-dependent immune responses, TFH cell differentiation requires interactions with two types of antigen-presenting cells. Dendritic cells (DCs) prime naive CD4 T cells by providing antigen-MHC class II complexes in concert with co-stimulation, including that delivered by inducible co-stimulator (ICOS) via ICOS ligand (ICOSL) on DCs. These signals, plus cytokines, initiate a transcriptional program driven by the canonical TFH cell transcription factor B cell lymphoma 6 (Bcl-6) and a second transcription factor Achaete-scute complex homolog 2 (Ascl2), leading to downregulation of P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 (PSGL1) and upregulation of PD1 and the chemokine receptor CXCR5, because cells acquire the TFH precursor cell phenotype (CD44 hi PSGL1 lo ) ( Choi et al., 2013 16.

Poholek, A.C. ∙ Hansen, K. ∙ Hernandez, S.G. ... In vivo regulation of Bcl6 and T follicular helper cell development J. Immunol. 2010; 185 :313-326 Google Scholar ). Subsequent interactions with B cells provide additional antigen-MHC II and ICOSL signals and are required for further differentiation into mature TFH cells that are capable of migrating via CXCR5 to, and functioning within, the GC ( Crotty, 2011 21. Crotty, S. Follicular helper CD4 T cells (TFH) Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2011; 29 :621-663 Google Scholar ). Mature TFH cells (CD44 hi ICOS hi PSGL1 lo PD1 hi CXCR5 hi ) provide CD40 ligand (CD40L and CD154) and interleukin-21 (IL-21) to CD40 + B cells, signals necessary for the differentiation and maturation of GC B cells to memory B cells and long-lived plasma cells ( Elgueta et al., 2009 29. Elgueta, R. ∙ Benson, M.J. ∙ de Vries, V.C. ... Molecular mechanism and function of CD40/CD40L engagement in the immune system Immunol.

Med. 2010; 207 :365-378 Google Scholar ). Thus, antigen-engaged, bidirectional TFH-B cell collaboration plays a pivotal role in the initiation and maintenance of robust humoral immune responses ( Mesin et al., 2016 89. Mesin, L. ∙ Ersching, J. ∙ Victora, G.D. Germinal Center B Cell Dynamics Immunity. 2016; 45 :471-482 Google Scholar ). Yet, the importance of interactions between tumor-specific TFH and B cells has not been studied in cancer. Nor is it clear whether anti-tumor TFH cells provide other functions in cancer beyond B cell help.
Studies in chronic viral infection and cancer have shown that CD4 T cells are critical to maintain effector CD8 T cell function ( Battegay et al., 1994 5.

The mechanisms of how CD4 T cells provide necessary help to CD8 T cells remain uncertain, but one proposal involves CD4 T cells providing IL-21, which drives cytolytic effector CD8 T cell differentiation and prevents T cell exhaustion ( Elsaesser et al., 2009 30.

The cellular resources of IL-21 in chronic infection and cancer are still not well characterized.
Given their potential importance in anti-tumor immunity, we studied the function of tumor-specific TFH cells in lung cancer and determined how their interactions with tumor-specific B cells and CD8 T cells impacted the anti-tumor immune responses.

Section: Results

To investigate the potential importance of GC B cells and TFH cells in human LUAD, we first analyzed RNA sequencing data from 513 LUAD samples in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database using CIBERSORT and LM22-referenced single-cell gene expression profile matrix ( Newman et al., 2015 96. Newman, A.M. ∙ Liu, C.L. ∙ Green, M.R. ... Robust enumeration of cell subsets from tissue expression profiles Nat. Methods. 2015; 12 :453-457 Google Scholar ). We found that several immune cell types were enriched, including myeloid populations and CD8 T cells ( Figure 1 A), whereas B cell lineage and CD4 T cells were the first and third most abundant immune cell types, respectively ( Figure 1 A). Although the LM22 matrix does not distinguish GC B cells, the algorithm suggested that TFH cells and activated memory CD4 T cells comprised a large proportion of the CD4 T cells in tumors ( Figure S1 A). To more specifically delineate which types of CD4 T and B cells were present in LUAD, we analyzed published single-cell RNA sequencing data from a study that included 44 individual samples of treatment-naive LUAD from surgical resection or endobronchial ultrasound bronchoscopy biopsy (GSE131907) ( Kim et al., 2020 66. Kim, N. ∙ Kim, H.K. ∙ Lee, K. ... Single-cell RNA sequencing demonstrates the molecular and cellular reprogramming of metastatic lung adenocarcinoma Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :2285 Google Scholar ). We cataloged 49,901 T/NK cells and 22,592 B cells from primary tumors (tLung), metastatic lymph nodes (mLN), normal lung tissues (nLung), and normal lymph nodes (nLN) based on their previous annotations. T/NK cells were grouped into 15 clusters and visualized by dimension reduction method uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) ( Figure 1 B). Eight clusters were distinguished as CD4 T cells, two of which displayed enrichment of TFH signature genes. Notably, both TFH-like clusters (cluster 14 and 10) had higher expression of the TFH signature cytokine IL-21 (arrow) and were more prominent in tLung than nLung ( Figure 1 D). Likewise, from nine B cell clusters, we identified one GC B cell cluster (cluster 5) and two antibody-secreting cell (ASC) clusters (clusters 4 and 6), both of which were enriched in tLung, compared with nLung ( Figures 1 C and 1E; note, cluster numbers in 1 C and 1E do not correspond with those in 1 B and 1D). These data suggested that TFH and GC B cells are enriched in human LUAD tumor tissues.
To examine whether GC B cells and TFH cells associate with clinical outcomes of LUAD individuals, we established gene expression signatures for LUAD GC B cells and TFH cells. Analysis of 478 LUAD cases from TCGA showed significant correlations between prolonged overall survival in LUAD individuals and GC B cell or TFH signatures ( Figures 1 F and 1G, respectively). By contrast, Th1, Th17, or NK cell signatures did not correlate with overall survival, and effector CD8 T cell signature correlated with slightly increased early survival benefits ( Figure S1 B). We also identified a significant correlation between the GC B cell and TFH signatures (R = 0.84, p < 0.0001), which suggested the co-existence of these two cell types in tumors ( Figure 1 H). GC B cell and TFH signatures were also correlated with Th1 and CD8 effector T cell signatures ( Figures 1 I and S1 C). The correlation of TFH and Th1 signatures was predicted, because these cell types likely share a common developmental origin ( Nakayamada et al., 2011 95. Nakayamada, S. ∙ Kanno, Y. ∙ Takahashi, H. ... Early Th1 cell differentiation is marked by a Tfh cell-like transition Immunity. 2011; 35 :919-931 Google Scholar ; O’Shea and Paul, 2010 101. O’Shea, J.J. ∙ Paul, W.E. Mechanisms underlying lineage commitment and plasticity of helper CD4+ T cells Science. 2010; 327 :1098-1102 Google Scholar ). However, correlations between the signatures of GC B cells, TFH cells, and CD8 T cells were intriguing because they suggested potential connections between these three immune cell types. By contrast, neither the GC B cell nor TFH signatures were correlated with the signatures for Th17 cells or NK cells. Together, these data suggested that GC B cells and TFH cells are present in human lung cancer and contribute to anti-tumor immune responses.
Next, we studied whether TFH cells were enriched in the context of murine LUAD. For this, we used a LUAD cell line made from syngeneic Kras LSL-G12D ; Trp53 fl/fl (KP) mice ( Damo et al., 2021 24. Damo, M. ∙ Fitzgerald, B. ∙ Lu, Y. ... Inducible de novo expression of neoantigens in tumor cells and mice Nat. Biotechnol. 2021; 39 :64-73 Google Scholar ). We subcutaneously (s.c.) implanted 2 × 10 5 KP cells into C57BL/6 (B6) recipients. As positive controls, we s.c. implanted MC38 or B16-F10, which have been previously shown to elicit TFH responses in vivo ( Alvarez Arias et al., 2014 3.

Med. 2020; 26 :919-931 Google Scholar ). After 10–12 days, we analyzed TFH cells in tumor-draining LNs (dLNs) by flow cytometry. Consistent with a progressive development of CD4 T cell responses, we observed ∼3-fold increases in CD44 hi PSGL1 lo CD4 T cells in MC38 and B16-F10 tumor-bearing mice, compared to non-tumor bearing controls, and ∼11% of these PSGL1 lo cells further displayed upregulated CXCR5 and PD-1, indicating development into mature TFH cells ( Figure S2 A) ( Weinstein et al., 2018 149. Weinstein, J.S. ∙ Laidlaw, B.J. ∙ Lu, Y. ... STAT4 and T-bet control follicular helper T cell development in viral infections J. Exp. Med. 2018; 215 :337-355 Google Scholar ). By contrast, only an ∼1.5-fold increase of CD44 hi PSGL1 lo CD4 T cells was observed in KP tumor-bearing mice, with TFH cells comprising ∼4% of these ( Figure 2 D).
KP cell lines are notable in that they have low numbers of somatic mutations ( DuPage et al., 2011 28. DuPage, M. ∙ Cheung, A.F. ∙ Mazumdar, C. ... Endogenous T cell responses to antigens expressed in lung adenocarcinomas delay malignant tumor progression Cancer Cell. 2011; 19 :72-85 Google Scholar ; McFadden et al., 2016 88. McFadden, D.G. ∙ Politi, K. ∙ Bhutkar, A. ... Mutational landscape of EGFR-, MYC-, and Kras-driven genetically engineered mouse models of lung adenocarcinoma Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Predicting immunogenic tumour mutations by combining mass spectrometry and exome sequencing Nature. 2014; 515 :572-576 Google Scholar ), and they do not elicit meaningful T or B cell responses, as evidenced by their unaffected growth in T and/or B cell deficient animals ( Figure S2 B). Taking advantage of this, the KP tumor cell line provided a system where we could assess how engineered neoantigens might drive anti-tumor T and B cell responses and how these responses impact tumor growth.
We recently published the “NINJA” model and showed that the NINJA system could be used to program neoantigen-expressing KP lung tumors ( Connolly et al., 2021 19. Connolly, K.A. ∙ Kuchroo, M. ∙ Venkat, A. ... A reservoir of stem-like CD8 + T cells in the tumor-draining lymph node preserves the ongoing antitumor immune response Sci. Immunol. 2021; 6 :eabg7836 Google Scholar ; Damo et al., 2021 24. Damo, M. ∙ Fitzgerald, B. ∙ Lu, Y. ... Inducible de novo expression of neoantigens in tumor cells and mice Nat. Biotechnol. 2021; 39 :64-73 Google Scholar ; Fitzgerald et al., 2021 34. Fitzgerald, B. ∙ Connolly, K.A. ∙ Cui, C. ... A mouse model for the study of anti-tumor T cell responses in Kras-driven lung adenocarcinoma Cell Rep Methods. 2021; 1 :100080 Google Scholar ). The cDNAs encoding NINJA neoantigens contain model antigens from the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) glycoprotein: GP 33–43 and GP 61–80 , which are recognized by GP33-specific CD8 (P14) and GP66-specific CD4 (SMARTA) T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic T cells, respectively, separated by the FLAG peptide sequence and embedded within a flexible loop region between β strands 7 and 8 of GFP (called GFP-GP 33–43 /FLAG/GP 61–80 ).The LCMV antigens were chosen because there is a wide array of immunologic tools that are available for studying T cell responses against these antigens (i.e., MHC class I and II tetramers and TCR transgenic mice). Moreover, we had previously engineered the sequence GP 33–43 /FLAG/GP 61–80 into GFP (called GFP-GP 33–43 /FLAG/GP 61–80 below) such that it allowed proper folding and fluorescence of GFP. Thus, we reasoned it would be an ideal starting point to design a neoantigen that was recognized by both T and B cells. Hen-egg lysozyme (HEL) is a widely used model B cell antigen, recognized by MD4 and SW HEL B cell receptor (BCR) transgenic B cells ( Goodnow et al., 1988 44. Goodnow, C.C. ∙ Crosbie, J. ∙ Adelstein, S. ... Altered immunoglobulin expression and functional silencing of self-reactive B lymphocytes in transgenic mice Nature. 1988; 334 :676-682 Google Scholar ; Phan et al., 2003 108. Phan, T.G. ∙ Amesbury, M. ∙ Gardam, S. ... B cell receptor-independent stimuli trigger immunoglobulin (Ig) class switch recombination and production of IgG autoantibodies by anergic self-reactive B cells J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197 :845-860 Google Scholar ). Therefore, to facilitate the investigation of tumor-specific T cell and B cell responses, we created a fusion protein of HEL, LCMV GP 33–43 /FLAG/GP 61–80 , T2A, and codon-optimized mScarlet ( Figure 2 A). This substrate was called HELLO and generated two polypeptides: the neoantigen fusion of HEL-GP 33–43 /FLAG/GP 61–80 and mScarlet, a bright red fluorescent protein to distinguish neoantigen-expressing tumor cells.
We transduced the KP tumor cell line with HELLO-encoding lentiviral vectors, in which HELLO was the only protein product, and sorted mScarlet-positive KP-HELLO tumor cells with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). We placed a signal peptide sequence in the HELLO construct prior to the neoantigen fusion HEL-GP 33–43 /FLAG/GP 61–80 so that it would be secreted by KP-HELLO cells, whereas mScarlet protein would remain in the cytoplasm ( Figure 2 A). To validate this, we isolated HEL-specific MD4 B cells, or polyclonal B6 B cells that are not enriched in HEL-specific BCRs (negative control), and added either HEL protein (positive control), KP, or KP-HELLO supernatant into each condition. After 48 h of culture, flow cytometric analyses showed activation of MD4 B cells, based on a significant increase in CD86 median fluorescence intensity (MFI), in samples where MD4 cells were incubated with KP-HELLO supernatant or HEL protein ( Figure 2 B). By contrast, B cell activation was not observed in negative control conditions. Next, we tested if HEL-specific B cells could present GP 66–77 from HEL-GP 33–43 /FLAG/GP 61–80 to GP66-specific CD4 T cells. For this, we cultured naive SMARTA CD4 T cells with MD4 B cells, or as negative controls, SMARTA T cells alone or with polyclonal B cells from B6 mice. Into each co-culture, we added KP or KP-HELLO supernatant, HEL protein (negative control), or GP 61–80 peptide (positive control). After 48 h, there was a significant increase of CD44 hi CD69 hi (activated) CD4 T cells in GP 61–80 -containing samples, demonstrating that B6 and MD4 B cells were capable of presenting GP 61–80 to SMARTA CD4 T cells ( Figures 2 C and S3 A). By contrast, when cultured with KP-HELLO supernatant, only MD4 B cells could activate SMARTA cells, demonstrating that a HEL-specific BCR was required for B cells to uptake, process, and present HEL-GP 33–43 /FLAG/GP 61–80 antigen to GP66-specific CD4 T cells. Of note, we could not detect robust GP33-specific CD8 T cell responses from KP-HELLO ( Figures S3 B–S3F). This was likely due to the biology of the GP 33–43 epitope in HELLO system (i.e., antigen processing), rather than a technical breakdown, and HEL-GP 33–43 /FLAG/GP 61–80 contained many other potential MHC class I restricted epitopes besides GP 33–43 ( Table S3 ). We focused on endogenous polyclonal CD8 T cell responses in following analyses.
To assess whether the introduction of HELLO neoantigens into KP tumors elicited TFH cell responses in vivo , we s.c. implanted 2 × 10 5 KP or KP-HELLO tumor cells into B6 mice and analyzed endogenous CD4 T cells in dLNs using flow cytometry. On days 10–12, the frequency of CD44 hi PSGL1 lo polyclonal CD4 T cells increased ∼1.3-fold overall (KP-HELLO versus KP), while there were ∼4-fold increases in the frequency of these PSGL1 lo cells that further upregulated PD-1 and CXCR5 ( Figure 2 D), resulting in a significant increase in the frequency of TFH cells ( Figure 2 E).
Next, we tested whether the linkage of GP 61–80 to a B cell antigen (HEL) elicited an increase in TFH cells among tumor-specific (GP66-specific) CD4 T cells. The GFP-GP 33–43 /FLAG/GP 61–80 in NINJA retains fluorescence and is recognized by conformation-specific anti-GFP antibodies. Thus, we reasoned that NINJA would be unlikely to elicit GFP-specific T or B cell responses in GFP-tolerant recipient mice (express GFP in an irrelevant location—we used Il4 GFP [ 4get ] mice), yet, GFP-tolerant recipients were still able to mount GP66-specific CD4 T cell responses contained in NINJA ( Damo et al., 2021 24. Damo, M. ∙ Fitzgerald, B. ∙ Lu, Y. ... Inducible de novo expression of neoantigens in tumor cells and mice Nat. Biotechnol. 2021; 39 :64-73 Google Scholar ). Therefore, we could directly compare the differentiation of endogenous tumor-specific CD4 T cells under conditions where tumors expressed CD4 T cell-recognized neoantigens with different capabilities to elicit antigen-specific B cell responses (KP-NINJA versus KP-HELLO). We previously described KP-NINJA (KPN1.1) cell line, which was derived from an autochthonous KP-NINJA LUAD ( Fitzgerald et al. , 2021 34. Fitzgerald, B. ∙ Connolly, K.A. ∙ Cui, C. ... A mouse model for the study of anti-tumor T cell responses in Kras-driven lung adenocarcinoma Cell Rep Methods. 2021; 1 :100080 Google Scholar ).
We s.c. implanted KP-NINJA or KP-HELLO tumors into Il4 GFP mice and analyzed GP66-specific CD4 T cells for their expression of TFH markers. Endogenous GP66-specific CD4 T cells were identified in mice with KP-HELLO or KP-NINJA tumors using I-A b /GP 66–77 -specific tetramers between days 10–12 after implant ( Figures 2 G and S4 A, ∼2-fold reduction in KP-NINJA). In KP-HELLO mice, ∼50%–60% of the GP66-specific CD4 T cells downregulated PSGL1, ∼30% of which further upregulated PD-1 and CXCR5 (TFH cells) ( Figure 2 F). These TFH cells were also marked by upregulation of Bcl-6, which is required for TFH cell differentiation ( Johnston et al., 2009 62. Johnston, R.J. ∙ Poholek, A.C. ∙ DiToro, D. ... Bcl6 and Blimp-1 are reciprocal and antagonistic regulators of T follicular helper cell differentiation Science. 2009; 325 :1006-1010 Google Scholar ; Nurieva et al., 2009 100. Nurieva, R.I. ∙ Chung, Y. ∙ Martinez, G.J. ... Bcl6 mediates the development of T follicular helper cells Science. 2009; 325 :1001-1005 Google Scholar ; Yu et al., 2009 156. Yu, D. ∙ Rao, S. ∙ Tsai, L.M. ... The transcriptional repressor Bcl-6 directs T follicular helper cell lineage commitment Immunity. 2009; 31 :457-468 Google Scholar ) ( Figure 2 F). Comparatively, the frequency of GP66-specific TFH cells was 17-fold higher in KP-HELLO tumor-bearing mice than KP-NINJA ( Figure 2 G). KP-HELLO tumors also potentiated GC B cell responses in vivo , because there was an ∼5-fold increase in the frequency of IgD lo -activated B cells compared with KP-NINJA, and ∼50%–60% of these cells were GL7 + CD95 + , consistent with a GC B cell phenotype ( Figure 2 H). As a result, KP-HELLO tumors had ∼8.5-fold and ∼10.5-fold increases in the frequency and number, respectively, of GC B cells in dLN compared to KP-NINJA tumors ( Figure 2 I). Similarly, when B6 mice containing adoptively transferred allotype-marked naive HEL-specific SW HEL B cells and SMARTA CD4 T cells were challenged with KP-HELLO tumor cells ( Figure S4 B), ∼50% of SMARTA cells were PSGL1 lo and ∼25% of these were mature TFH cells ( Figure S4 C). Likewise, ∼30% of the adoptively transferred SW HEL B cells were IgD lo , ∼50% of which were GL7 + CD95 + Bcl-6 hi ( Figure S4 D). Together, these data demonstrated that the B cell-containing neoantigens in KP-HELLO tumors were sufficient to elicit tumor-specific TFH and GC B cell responses.
KP-HELLO tumors displayed an increased growth rate in immunodeficient RAG1 knockout (KO) mice compared with B6 mice ( Figure S5 A). This was not due to a cell intrinsic growth defect, because parental KP and KP-HELLO tumors grew similarly in RAG1 KO mice ( Figure S5 B). Because KP tumor cells grow similarly in RAG1 KO and B6 hosts ( Figure S2 B), the reduced growth of KP-HELLO in B6 mice was due to the impact of adaptive immune cells responding to HELLO. To assess whether B cells, CD4 T cells, and specifically CD4 TFH cells were necessary for tumor control, we measured KP-HELLO tumor growth in uMT, CIITA KO mice (lacking mature B cells or CD4 T cells, respectively), and CD4-Cre Bcl6 fl/fl , a commonly used TFH-deficient animal model ( Crotty, 2019 22. Crotty, S. T Follicular Helper Cell Biology: A Decade of Discovery and Diseases Immunity. 2019; 50 :1132-1148 Google Scholar ; Hollister et al., 2013 56. Hollister, K. ∙ Kusam, S. ∙ Wu, H. ... Insights into the role of Bcl6 in follicular Th cells using a new conditional mutant mouse model J. Immunol. 2013; 191 :3705-3711 Google Scholar ). We observed that CD4 T cells, TFH cells, and B cells were critical for optimal control over KP-HELLO tumor growth ( Figures 3 A–3C). By contrast, KP-NINJA tumor growth was not significantly different in B6 versus uMT hosts ( Figure 3 E). We further analyzed CD4 T cell phenotypes in KP-HELLO tumor-bearing uMT and CD4-Cre Bcl6 fl/fl mice. Endogenous GP66-specific CD4 T cell responses were readily detectable in dLNs from KP-HELLO tumor-bearing B6, uMT, and CD4-Cre Bcl6 fl/fl mice ( Figures S5 C and S5F), but GP66-specific mature TFH cells were absent in uMT and CD4-Cre Bcl6 fl/fl mice ( Figures 3 D, S5 E, and S5G). Notably, the latter also had significant reductions in GP66-specific CD44 hi PSGL1 lo cells, which comprise both TFH-precursors and TFH cells ( Figures S5 D and S5G). These data demonstrated that B cells and TFH cells were necessary to reduce the growth of KP-HELLO tumors.
It remained possible that TFH and B cells acted in a non-antigen driven fashion to promote anti-tumor immune response. To formally test whether tumor-specific B cells were sufficient to control KP-HELLO tumors, we performed a rescue experiment by adoptively transferring naive tumor-specific SW HEL or polyclonal wild-type (WT) B6 B cells into uMT recipients prior to KP-HELLO tumor initiation. Only adoptive transfer of the SW HEL B cells rescued tumor control in uMT mice back to the level observed in control mice ( Figure 3 F). Likewise, adoptive-transfer of naive GP66-specific SMARTA CD4 T cells into CD4-Cre Bcl6 fl/fl recipients, but not irrelevant-antigen-specific OT-II CD4 T cells, restored the ability of TFH-deficient animals to control KP-HELLO tumors ( Figure 3 G). Approximately 50%–60% of these transferred SMARTA cells downregulated PSGL1, with ∼25% of these becoming mature TFH cells ( Figure 3 H). In contrast, endogenous GP66-specific T cells from the same CD4-Cre Bcl6 fl/fl animal were incapable of developing into mature TFH cells or even becoming TFH precursors (note 96% decrease in PSGL1 lo cells; Figure 3 I). Thus, in the rescued CD4-Cre Bcl6 fl/fl mice, the TFH compartment was solely comprised of SMARTA CD4 T cells. Lymphocyte antigen 6C (Ly6C) expression on CD44 hi PSGL1 hi has been widely used to discriminate TH1 from TFH cells, because Ly6C is regulated by TH1-specific transcription factor T-bet ( Hale et al., 2013 49.

Th1-like Plasmodium-Specific Memory CD4 + T Cells Support Humoral Immunity Cell Rep. 2018; 23 :1230-1237 Google Scholar ). Compared to the transferred SMARTA CD4 T cells, the endogenous GP66-specific T cells in CD4-Cre Bcl6 fl/fl mice had increased frequencies of both PSGL1 hi Ly6C lo and PSGL1 hi Ly6C hi TH1-like cells, the latter of which expressed higher amounts of T-bet than their TFH counterparts ( Figures 3 H, 3I, S5 G, and S5H). Similar results were seen from endogenous GP66-specific T cells in CD4-Cre Bcl6 fl/fl mice that had not received SMARTA CD4 T cells.
Given that differences in tumor growth were apparent between WT mice and B or T cell-deficient mice at relatively early time points after tumor implant (8–12 days), we focused on whether CD8 T cells were impacted by B and T cell deficiency. First, we determined whether CD8 T cells were necessary for optimal tumor control in our model by examining KP-HELLO tumor growth in B6 mice with or without anti-CD8a antibody depletion. CD8 T cell depletion was efficient (data not shown) and led to impaired tumor control in mice ( Figure 4 A). We next examined the impact of TFH deficiency on CD8 T cells. In KP-HELLO tumor-bearing WT mice, ∼40% of the tumor-infiltrating CD8 T cells were granzyme B hi , consistent with an effector phenotype ( Figure 4 B). In line with this, most of these granzyme B hi cells expressed PD-1. In comparison, TFH-deficient mice had a significant reduction in the frequency and number of tumor-infiltrating PD-1 hi granzyme B hi CD8 T cells ( Figure 4 B, see Figures 6 O–6P for further quantification). Similarly, there was a significant reduction in the frequency and number of tumor-infiltrating PD-1 hi granzyme B hi CD8 T cells in uMT mice ( Figures 4 C–4E). These data supported a model where TFH cells and B cells support the function of tumor-infiltrating CD8 T cells, but to test this further, we compared CD8 T cell function in WT and uMT KP-NINJA tumor-bearing mice, because these tumors did not elicit TFH or GC B cell responses. Critically, B cell-deficiency did not impact granzyme B expression by tumor-infiltrating CD8 T cells in KP-NINJA tumors ( Figures 4 F–4H). These data demonstrated that B cell antigens can drive effector CD8 T cell responses via a TFH cell- and B cell-dependent mechanism.
In addition to s.c. implant tumor model, we also tested whether TFH and CD8 T cell responses required the presence of B cells in the autochthonous Kras LSL-G12D ;Trp53 fl/fl (KP) mouse LUAD model. KP tumors recapitulate cancers that lack neoantigens ( McFadden et al., 2016 88. McFadden, D.G. ∙ Politi, K. ∙ Bhutkar, A. ... Mutational landscape of EGFR-, MYC-, and Kras-driven genetically engineered mouse models of lung adenocarcinoma Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113 :E6409-E6417 Google Scholar ) but have been programmed to express T cell neoantigens using lentiviral vectors (LV) ( DuPage et al., 2011 28. DuPage, M. ∙ Cheung, A.F. ∙ Mazumdar, C. ... Endogenous T cell responses to antigens expressed in lung adenocarcinomas delay malignant tumor progression Cancer Cell. 2011; 19 :72-85 Google Scholar ; Joshi et al., 2015 63. Joshi, N.S. ∙ Akama-Garren, E.H. ∙ Lu, Y. ... Regulatory T Cells in Tumor-Associated Tertiary Lymphoid Structures Suppress Anti-tumor T Cell Responses Immunity. 2015; 43 :579-590 Google Scholar ; Pfirschke et al., 2016 107. Pfirschke, C. ∙ Engblom, C. ∙ Rickelt, S. ... Immunogenic Chemotherapy Sensitizes Tumors to Checkpoint Blockade Therapy Immunity. 2016; 44 :343-354 Google Scholar ). Thus, we engineered non-replicating Lenti-HELLO-Cre LV, encoding both the HELLO fusion protein and Cre recombinase, and administered them intratracheally into KP and B cell-deficient uMT-KP mice ( Figure S6 A). This resulted in autochthonous HELLO-expressing lung tumors for analysis after 8 weeks. The lungs of mice are highly vascularized, so to distinguish lung tissue-infiltrating immune cells from circulating cells for flow cytometric analyses, we performed in vivo -labeling of circulating immune cells with PE-CF594 conjugated anti-CD45 (lung-tissue immune cells are CD45i.v. Neg ) ( Figure S6 B). In non-tumor-bearing mice, <1% of B, CD4 T, and CD8 T cells were in lung tissue, but in HELLO tumor-bearing mice, this increased to ∼13% of B cells, ∼60% of CD4 T cells, and ∼40% of CD8 T cells ( Figure S6 C). Endogenous GP66-specific mature TFH cells were observed in the tumor lung tissues and dLNs of HELLO tumor-bearing KP mice, but not in uMT-KP mice ( Figure S6 D). Likewise, analysis of activated CD19 + B220 + IgD lo B cells showed ∼2% and ∼50% of these cells expressed GC B cell markers (IgD lo GL7 + CD95 + Bcl6 hi ) in lung and dLN, respectively ( Figure S6 E). Finally, the absence of B cells led to a significant drop in tumor-infiltrating CD44 hi PD1 hi effector CD8 T cells ( Figure S6 F). These data were consistent with our findings in s.c. implanted KP-HELLO tumors.
We next investigated the mechanism for how TFH and B cells promote the effector functions of tumor-infiltrating CD8 T cells. We reasoned this could be via IL-21, a signature cytokine of TFH cells ( Crotty, 2011 21. Crotty, S. Follicular helper CD4 T cells (TFH) Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2011; 29 :621-663 Google Scholar ) that can drive effector function of CD8 T cells ( Zander et al., 2019 159. Zander, R. ∙ Schauder, D. ∙ Xin, G. ... CD4 + T Cell Help Is Required for the Formation of a Cytolytic CD8 + T Cell Subset that Protects against Chronic Infection and Cancer Immunity. 2019; 51 :1028-1042.e4 Google Scholar ). We first examined which cells in the dLN express IL-21 by s.c. implanting KP-HELLO into Il21-Katushka ( Kat ) reporter mice ( Weinstein et al., 2016 148. Weinstein, J.S. ∙ Herman, E.I. ∙ Lainez, B. ... TFH cells progressively differentiate to regulate the germinal center response Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17 :1197-1205 Google Scholar ). IL-21 expression was only detected from mice with KP-HELLO tumors, but not KP tumors, demonstrating that IL-21 expression required the presence of the HELLO neoantigens ( Figure 5 A). Greater than 95% of the IL-21 expressing cells were CD4 T cells and ∼85% of these were PSGL1 lo with ∼70% expressing mature TFH cell markers ( Figure 5 A). We next addressed whether IL-21 expression on T cells was B cell-dependent using Il21 Kat/Kat x uMT mice. In the absence of B cells, we observed ∼70% reduction in the frequency of IL-21-expressing GP66-specific CD44 hi CD4 T cells in dLNs and ∼35% reduction in tumors ( Figures 5 B and 5C). Likewise, B cell-recognized neoantigens were required for IL-21 expression as KP-NINJA tumors exhibited ∼70% reduction in the frequency of IL-21 expressing GP66-specific CD44 hi CD4 T cells ( Figures 5 D and 5E). Thus, the induction and/or maintenance of IL-21 in TFH cells by tumors required B cells and B cell-recognized neoantigens.
The receptor for IL-21 (IL21R) was expressed on CD44 hi PD1 hi effector CD8 T cells in both tumors and dLNs ( Figure 5 F). To test if IL-21 was important for KP-HELLO tumor growth, we s.c. implanted KP-HELLO tumor cells into B6 or IL-21R KO mice. KP-HELLO tumors grew more rapidly in IL-21R KO than B6 mice ( Figure 5 G). There was also an ∼60% and ∼80% reduction in the frequency and number of PD-1 hi granzyme B hi tumor-infiltrating CD8 T cells in IL-21R KO mice, respectively ( Figures 5 H–5J). These findings were in line with data from other groups showing that IL-21 acts on CD8 T cells to drive the effector functions ( Elsaesser et al., 2009 30. Elsaesser, H. ∙ Sauer, K. ∙ Brooks, D.G.

To close the loop between TFH, B cells, IL-21 signals, and effector CD8 T cell responses, we first assessed whether T cell-B cell interactions were necessary for anti-tumor immunity. In T-dependent immune responses, CD40/CD40L-deficient and ICOS/ICOSL-deficient mice are not able to form GC B cells or mature TFH cells due to defects in the ability of T cells and B cells to provide mutual help ( Choi et al., 2011 15.

Zhang, B. ∙ Liu, E. ∙ Gertie, J.A. ... Divergent T follicular helper cell requirement for IgA and IgE production to peanut during allergic sensitization Sci. Immunol. 2020; 5 :eaay2754 Google Scholar ). Deficiencies in ICOS and CD40L led to more rapid growth of KP-HELLO tumors, on par with the changes observed in uMT mice ( Figures 6 A and 6B). Mature TFH and GC B cell responses were impaired in ICOS-deficient mice (data not shown). ICOS deficiency could impact many cell types, but adoptive transfer of WT SMARTA T cells into ICOS-deficient hosts rescued KP-HELLO tumor control, whereas transfer of OT-II T cells did not ( Figure 6 C). These data are consistent with the idea that T cell and B cell interactions are necessary for control over the growth of KP-HELLO tumors.
Next, we assessed the impact of SMARTA T cell rescue on B cells and CD8 T cells in TFH-deficient mice, because under this experimental setting, the only functional TFH cells were transferred GP66-specific SMARTA cells ( Figures 3 G–3I). Polyclonal GC B cell responses in CD4-Cre Bcl6 fl/fl mice were significantly reduced compared to B6 controls and this was rescued by adoptive transfer of SMARTA but not OT-II T cells ( Figures 6 D and 6E). This ∼9-fold increase in polyclonal GC B cell frequency was particularly striking, because the rescue only restored TFH cells with a single specificity (GP66-specific) and was consistent with potent interactions between B cells and tumor-specific TFH cells in KP-HELLO tumor model. To assess the functional role of T cell-B cell interactions, we used flow cytometry to analyze how the differentiation programs of tumor-specific CD4 T cells were altered when tumor-bearing mice lacked B cells (B6 versus uMT), or B cell-recognized neoantigens (KP-HELLO versus KP-NINJA). In both cases, tumor-specific TFH cell responses were significantly compromised ( Figures 2 F, 2G, 3 D, and S5 E), but there was also a significant reduction of PSGL1 lo Ly6C lo cells ( Figure 6 F – 6G and 6J – 6K). These data are consistent with the hypothesis that B cells and B cell-recognized neoantigens control the developmental fates of tumor-specific CD4 T cells by promoting the TFH differentiation program (beginning with downregulation of PSGL1). To assess the impact of T cell-B cell interactions over the course of TFH differentiation, we analyzed Bcl-6 and IL-21 expression at the different stages of CD4 T cell differentiation (based on markers) in B6 versus uMT or KP-HELLO versus KP-NINJA. We found that both Bcl-6 and IL-21 expression were compromised at each stage in the absence of TFH-B cell interactions ( Figures 6 H, 6I, 6L, and 6M, gating strategy in 3 D, 6 F, and 6J). Similar data were seen in mice with MC38 and B16-F10 tumors ( Figures S7 A–S7C). Finally, to assess the functional impact of TFH-B cell interactions on tumor-infiltrating CD8 T cells, we analyzed their phenotypes in the context of rescue of TFH-deficient mice adoptively transferred with WT SMARTA CD4 T cells. The significant decrease in PD-1 hi granzyme B hi among tumor-infiltrating CD8 T cells in TFH-deficient mice was rescued to WT levels by SMARTA T cell transfer, but not by OT-II T cell transfer, both in terms of frequency and number ( Figures 6 N–6P). Thus, the presence of tumor-specific TFH cells was sufficient to drive effector functions in tumor-infiltrating CD8 T cells.

Section: Discussion

We have identified a mechanism by which interactions between tumor-specific CD4 T cells and B cells are necessary for the generation of IL-21-producing TFH cells, and this leads to increased granzyme B expression by tumor-infiltrating CD8 T cells. We provided evidence for this B cell-TFH cell-IL21 axis through analyses of LUAD individuals and animal models. We also demonstrated that this pathway can be driven by B cell-recognized neoantigens, underscoring a mechanism by which tumor neoantigens can guide CD4 T cell differentiation.
Our findings on tumor-infiltrating TFH cells and GC B cells in human LUAD are in line with previous observations that NSCLC and other cancer types contain tumor-associated TFH-like cells with an enriched TFH signature (i.e., PDCD1 , ICOS , CD200 , MAF , and IL21 ) ( Bindea et al., 2013 6.

However, our data suggested an alternative possibility that TLS could promote tumor-specific T cell-B cell collaborations that would support the effector functions of tumor-infiltrating CD8 T cells via IL-21.
Based on our data, we believe that TFH cells are a key physiological source of IL-21 for tumor-infiltrating effector CD8 T cells and that this is one mechanism for how TFH cells promote better outcomes in LUAD individuals. A critical question arising from our work is how and where TFH cells provide IL-21 to CD8 T cells. Several studies in chronic LCMV infection have focused on the critical role of CD4 T cell-derived IL-21 in promoting stem-like CXCR5 + TCF1 + CD8 T cells (TSL) to differentiate toward a granzyme B hi effector cytolytic T cell fate ( Chen et al., 2021 14.

Moreover, ∼30% of splenic TSL cells are in B cell follicles whereas ∼50%–60% are in T cell zones in LCMV infected mice ( He et al., 2016 51. He, R. ∙ Hou, S. ∙ Liu, C. ...

The infrastructure to promote interactions between CXCR5 + IL-21-producing TFH cells and CXCR5 + TCF1 + TSL cells likely resides in B cell follicles of secondary lymphoid organs (LNs and spleens) and/or in tumor-associated TLSs that have GCs. In line with this, CXCR5 + TCF1 + TSL cells are enriched in tumors from NSCLC individuals, and this correlates with tumor infiltration of CXCR5 + TFH cells and CD19 + B cells ( Brummelman et al., 2018 10.

We and others have also recently demonstrated that draining LN associated with lung adenocarcinoma maintains a stable reservoir of tumor-specific TSLs throughout tumor development, and migration of these cells from dLNs to tumors is required to maintain TCF1 + CD8 T cells in tumors ( Connolly et al., 2021 19.

We have also found tumor-associated TLSs in our autochthonous tumor models ( Fitzgerald et al., 2021 34. Fitzgerald, B. ∙ Connolly, K.A. ∙ Cui, C. ...

Thus, we hypothesize that TFH cell-CD8 T cell interactions are likely to occur in the dLNs of s.c. implanted KP-HELLO tumors, but these could also occur in tumor-associated TLS when GCs present. Further research will be necessary to elucidate the site of action for B cell-TFH cell-IL21 interactions in different tumor contexts.
Studies of neoantigen immunogenicity generally focus on metrics such as neoantigen abundance, MHC binding, and T cell recognition to identify candidate neoantigens for therapeutic efforts ( Schumacher and Hacohen, 2016 125.

Our findings, however, raise the possibility that other aspects of neoantigens should also be considered. These include the assessment of mutation sites and whether they would result in structural alterations that are able to change BCR binding and B cell recognition. B cell-recognized neoantigens were unique in that they were sufficient to potentiate TFH cell differentiation pathways, which provided non-redundant help for anti-tumor CD8 T cell responses via IL-21 in our model. This is in line with multiple studies showing that the presence of both cognate B cells and antigens with B cell- and CD4 T cell-recognized epitopes was required for IL-21 production by PD1 hi CXCR5 hi TFH cells ( Kerfoot et al., 2011 64.

Moreover, the principle of intermolecular help, in which antigen-engaged B cells are able to internalize and process whole antigenic proteins and subsequently present different MHCII epitopes to CD4 T cells, ensures that rare, cognate interactions between tumor-specific B and CD4 T cells are enabled and augmented by B cell-recognized neoantigens ( Milich et al., 1987 90.

MHC-II restricted neoantigens, recognized by CD4 T cells, have been shown to be indispensable for successful anti-tumor responses ( Alspach et al., 2019 2.

Med. 2015; 21 :81-85 Google Scholar ), but less is known about how individual neoantigens, or their structures, could impact fate decisions by anti-tumor CD4 T cells. We found B cell-recognized epitopes were necessary for TFH cell development, and concurrently, co-existence of GC B cells and TFH cells in many human cancers strongly suggests that many tumors could express B cell-recognized neoantigens. Here, it is possible that the B cell-recognized portions are neoepitopes or are non-mutated epitopes connected to neoantigens recognized by CD4 T cells. Thus, tumors not only shape T cell responses via their production of chemokines, cytokines, and innate immune signaling modulators (i.e., STING/ RIG-I), but also via structural features of their neoantigens. Gaining a better understanding of how various features of neoantigens drive different CD4 T cell fates could help to design therapies that leverage a wider variety of immune cell functions. Our approach provides an easily adaptable platform to investigate different aspects of B and T cell neoantigens, such as secreted/membrane-bound/intracellular features, and BCR binding affinity, of which available tools have already been established from many studies ( Burnett et al., 2018 12. Burnett, D.L. ∙ Langley, D.B. ∙ Schofield, P. ... Germinal center antibody mutation trajectories are determined by rapid self/foreign discrimination Science. 2018; 360 :223-226 Google Scholar ; Paus et al., 2006 105. Paus, D. ∙ Phan, T.G. ∙ Chan, T.D. ... Antigen recognition strength regulates the choice between extrafollicular plasma cell and germinal center B cell differentiation J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203 :1081-1091 Google Scholar ).
Given the pivotal functional role of T cell-B cell interactions in controlling tumors, demonstrated by our work and others, the B cell-TFH cell-IL21 axis could provide an entry point for therapeutic manipulation. Preclinical studies and phase I clinical trials of personalized neoantigen vaccines, utilizing MHC class I binding epitopes, have successfully demonstrated the induction of de novo neoantigen-specific CD4 and CD8 T cell responses in individuals with NSCLC, bladder cancer, melanoma, and glioblastoma ( Keskin et al., 2019 65. Keskin, D.B. ∙ Anandappa, A.J. ∙ Sun, J. ... Neoantigen vaccine generates intratumoral T cell responses in phase Ib glioblastoma trial Nature. 2019; 565 :234-239 Google Scholar ; Ott et al., 2017 103. Ott, P.A. ∙ Hu, Z. ∙ Keskin, D.B. ... An immunogenic personal neoantigen vaccine for patients with melanoma Nature. 2017; 547 :217-221 Google Scholar , 2020 104. Ott, P.A. ∙ Hu-Lieskovan, S. ∙ Chmielowski, B. ... A Phase Ib Trial of Personalized Neoantigen Therapy Plus Anti-PD-1 in Patients with Advanced Melanoma, Non-small Cell Lung Cancer, or Bladder Cancer Cell. 2020; 183 :347-362.e24 Google Scholar ). Here, one possibility could be to modify these personalized neoantigen vaccines to include epitopes recognized by both B and T cells. We predict that this would boost responses by neoantigen-specific TFH cells, facilitate their IL-21 production, and promote anti-tumor responses by effector CD8 T cells. Alternatively, one study found that B cell-based neoantigen vaccines could promote checkpoint blockade efficacy by activating autologous CD8 T cells in animal models of glioblastoma ( Lee-Chang et al., 2021 72. Lee-Chang, C. ∙ Miska, J. ∙ Hou, D. ... Activation of 4-1BBL+ B cells with CD40 agonism and IFNγ elicits potent immunity against glioblastoma J. Exp. Med. 2021; 218 :e20200913 Google Scholar ). Beyond vaccines, agonist antibodies or cytokines targeting the B cell-TFH cell-IL21 axis could also provide therapeutic benefits. Anti-ICOS agonist antibody (GSK3359609) is currently in phase II/III clinical trials in combination with PD-1 or PD-L1 blockade. Moreover, combining engineered IL-21 with existing immunotherapies can elicit robust anti-tumor immune responses ( Deng et al., 2020 25. Deng, S. ∙ Sun, Z. ∙ Qiao, J. ...

Taken together, these data suggested that therapeutic designs leveraging the B cell-TFH cell-IL21 axis could advance existing immunotherapies and lead to improved response rates for individuals with lung and other cancers.
We showed the importance of T and B cell collaborations on driving IL-21-producing CD4 T cells in detail but relied on previous work demonstrating how IL-21 helps to sustain cytolytic effector functions of CD8 T cells ( Chen et al., 2021 14.

CD4 + T Cell Help Is Required for the Formation of a Cytolytic CD8 + T Cell Subset that Protects against Chronic Infection and Cancer Immunity. 2019; 51 :1028-1042.e4 Google Scholar ). Our studies did not delve into the location where IL-21 is provided to CD8 T cells or which CD8 T cell types receive the IL-21. We discuss the idea that this may differ depending on the presence of tumor-associated TLSs. Further studies will be necessary to dissect the spatial and temporal dynamics of TFH-IL21-CD8 T cell interactions.

KP was transduced with HELLO Lentiviral vector (LV). The LV backbone for HELLO has been described previously ( Akama-Garren et al., 2016 1. Akama-Garren, E.H. ∙ Joshi, N.S. ∙ Tammela, T. ... A Modular Assembly Platform for Rapid Generation of DNA Constructs Sci. Rep. 2016; 6 :16836 Google Scholar ). HELLO-LV contains HELLO driven by phosphoglycerate kinase (pGK) promoter. HELLO was generated as a protein fusion of codon-optimized hen egg lysozyme (HEL), LCMVgp 33-43 (KAVYNFATCGI), LCMVgp 61-80 (GLNGPDIYKGVYQFKSVEFD), and 2A peptide-linked mScarlet. The DNA and amino acid sequences of HELLO construct are available in Table S2 . NET MHC4.0 web server was used to predict MHC class I binding peptides (H-2Db and H-2Kb) in HELLO, with results summarized in Table S3 . KP cells were transduced with HELLO-LV produced by co-transfection of 293FS ∗ cells with HELLO, PSPax2 (gag/pol) and VSV-G (vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein) vectors as described previously ( Damo et al., 2021 24. Damo, M. ∙ Fitzgerald, B. ∙ Lu, Y. ... Inducible de novo expression of neoantigens in tumor cells and mice Nat. Biotechnol. 2021; 39 :64-73 Google Scholar ). Transduced LGKP cells were FACS-sorted, yielding a pure mScarlet population of KP-HELLO cells. 25 frozen aliquots of KP-HELLO were generated after 2 passages and were named as “G0.” Based on 1 aliquot of “G0,” 20 frozen aliquots of “G1” were generated after 2 passages, and so as “G2” based on “G1.” For each experiment, one fresh aliquot of “G2” was thawed and used within 2 passages. After 6-7 passages described above, > 99% of KP-HELLO “G2” cells were still mScarlet positive with flow cytometric analysis, which suggested the stable expression of HELLO protein in KP-HELLO cell line.
Genomic DNA was extracted from two separate cultures of KP-HELLO (2 × 10 6 cells for each lysis) using the Takara Bio NucleoSpin Tissue kit (Cat#: 740952.50). PCR (Takara Bio High Fidelity PCR EcoDry Premix, Cat. # 639280) was performed to amplify the proviral DNA sequences encoding the GP 33-43 /FLAG/GP 61-80 from the KP-HELLO cell genomic DNA. Amplified products were purified using the Takara Bio NucleoSpin Gel and PCR Clean-up kit (Cat. #740609.50) and were subsequently sequenced with Sanger sequencing using 2 different sets of specific primers.
“Lenti-HELLO-Cre” plasmids were generated by cloning Cre into HELLO-LV. Lentiviral vectors were produced by transfecting 293FS ∗ cells with Lenti-HELLO-Cre, PSPax2 and VSV-G vectors at a 4:3:1 ratio, of which supernatant was harvested at 100,000 g for 2 hours (20°C), after 32-hour incubation at 37°C, as described previously ( Joshi et al., 2015 63. Joshi, N.S. ∙ Akama-Garren, E.H. ∙ Lu, Y. ... Regulatory T Cells in Tumor-Associated Tertiary Lymphoid Structures Suppress Anti-tumor T Cell Responses Immunity. 2015; 43 :579-590 Google Scholar ). LV titer was quantified by transducing GreenGo cell line (10 5 cells/well) in serial dilutions to 1mL of final volume and calculated with the formula: (% fluorescent cells x 10 5 x Dilution Factor)/100 (pfu/mL). For autochthonous KP-HELLO tumor initiation, 5 × 10 4 pfu Lenti-HELLO-Cre were administered intratracheally to KP mice.
To deplete CD8 T Cells, 200ug/mouse anti-CD8a antibodies (clone: 53-6.7; InVivoMab) were diluted in PBS, and injected intraperitoneally every three days, 10 days prior to tumor initiation until the end point of experiments. For adoptive transfer, naive CD8 + T cells, CD4 + T cells and/or B cells were separated from spleens by negative selection with EasySep Mouse CD8 + T Cell Isolation Kit, Mouse CD4 + T Cell Isolation Kit and/or Mouse B Cell Isolation Kit, respectively (STEMCELL technologies). For rescue experiments, 1 × 10 6 SW HEL or WT C57BL/6 B cells were transferred into age- and sex-matched uMT mice, and 1 × 10 5 SMARTA or OT-II T cells were transferred into age- and sex-matched CD4-cre Bcl6 fl/fl mice, with 2 × 10 5 KP-HELLO s.c. implanted one day later. For co-transfer experiments, CD45.1/CD45.2 or Thy1.1/Thy1.2 allotype-marked P14 (5 × 10 5 /mouse), SMARTA (1 × 10 5 /mouse) and SW HEL (1 × 10 5 /mouse) cells were co-transferred into naive CD45.2/CD45.2 Thy1.2/Thy1.2 mice one day prior to tumor initiation.
Subcutaneously implanted solid tumors were dissected, cut into small pieces and digested with 5mL Collagenase IV buffer (1x HEPES buffer, 0.5mg/mL Collagenase IV, 20 μg/mL DNase in 1x HBSS with MgCl 2 and CaCl 2 ) for 30-40 minutes at 37°C, as described previously ( Connolly et al., 2021 19. Connolly, K.A. ∙ Kuchroo, M. ∙ Venkat, A. ... A reservoir of stem-like CD8 + T cells in the tumor-draining lymph node preserves the ongoing antitumor immune response Sci. Immunol. 2021; 6 :eabg7836 Google Scholar ; Fitzgerald et al., 2021 34. Fitzgerald, B. ∙ Connolly, K.A. ∙ Cui, C. ... A mouse model for the study of anti-tumor T cell responses in Kras-driven lung adenocarcinoma Cell Rep Methods. 2021; 1 :100080 Google Scholar ; Joshi et al., 2015 63. Joshi, N.S. ∙ Akama-Garren, E.H. ∙ Lu, Y. ... Regulatory T Cells in Tumor-Associated Tertiary Lymphoid Structures Suppress Anti-tumor T Cell Responses Immunity. 2015; 43 :579-590 Google Scholar ). Samples were then run on the default lung_02 program on a gentleMACS Dissociator instrument (Miltenyi Biotec). Digestion was neutralized by adding 5mL 1% HI-FBS RPMI-1640. Tumor samples were filtered with 70 μm cell strainers and washed with 1% HI-FBS RPMI-1640. Cell suspensions were then processed with Mouse CD45 (TIL) MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec) to enrich for CD45 + TILs. For autochthonous lung tumors, mice were injected intravenously with CD45-PE-CF594 (1:100 diluted in PBS, clone: 30-F11), 2-3 minutes before sacrifice as described previously ( Joshi et al., 2015 63. Joshi, N.S. ∙ Akama-Garren, E.H. ∙ Lu, Y. ... Regulatory T Cells in Tumor-Associated Tertiary Lymphoid Structures Suppress Anti-tumor T Cell Responses Immunity. 2015; 43 :579-590 Google Scholar ). Lungs were harvested, run on lung_01 program with gentleMACS Dissociator and digested with Collagenase IV buffer as described above, for 30-40 minutes at 37°C. Samples were then run on the lung_02 program, neutralized by 1% HI-FBS RPMI-1640, filtered with 70 μm cell strainers, washed with 1% HI-FBS RPMI-1640 and treated with RBC lysis buffer (eBioscience) to remove red blood cells. Tumor-draining lymph nodes were harvested, filtered with 70 μm cell strainers and processed as described previously ( Damo et al., 2021 24. Damo, M. ∙ Fitzgerald, B. ∙ Lu, Y. ... Inducible de novo expression of neoantigens in tumor cells and mice Nat. Biotechnol. 2021; 39 :64-73 Google Scholar ; Joshi et al., 2015 63. Joshi, N.S. ∙ Akama-Garren, E.H. ∙ Lu, Y. ... Regulatory T Cells in Tumor-Associated Tertiary Lymphoid Structures Suppress Anti-tumor T Cell Responses Immunity. 2015; 43 :579-590 Google Scholar ).
Single cell suspensions were stained with antibodies for surface markers. For I-Ab/GP 66-77 -specific tetramer (NIH Tetramer Core Facility) staining, cells were incubated 2-3 hours at 37°C prior to surface staining. For intracellular staining, cells were processed using either Foxp3/Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Set (eBioscience) for transcription factors, or Fixation/Permeabilization Solution Kit (BD Cytofix/Cytoperm) for cytokines. Cells were washed and resuspended in FACS Buffers (PBS + 0.5% HI-FBS) until data collection. Flow cytometry was performed with LSR II flow cytometer (BD Bioscience), and analyzed by FlowJo software (version 10, TreeStar). For MFI quantification, median was applied to logarithmic histogram for specific molecules.
P14 CD8 + T cells were isolated with EasySep Mouse CD8 T Cell Isolation Kit (StemCell). After isolation, P14 cells were resuspend in 5 mL warm PBS at 2 × 10 6 cells/mL. 5 mL of 2 uM CFSE (ThermoFisher) staining buffer (2 × ) was freshly prepared in warm PBS and then added to P14 suspension drop by drop during vortex. CFSE labeling was allowed at 37 C for 5 minutes and quenched with 5 mL of 100% FBS at 37 C for another minute. CFSE-labeled P14 cells were washed and resuspended in complete RPMI and ready to be used for DC-P14 coculture. DCs were isolated from pooled spleens and LNs using the EasySep Mouse Pan-DC Enrichment Kit (StemCell) per manufacturer’s instruction. 2 × 10 4 DCs were stimulated by 100 ng/mL LPS in complete RPMI for 16 hours in a 96-well format. LPS-stimulated DCs were then incubated with 5 ug/mL GP33 peptide or HELLO cell culture supernatant for 2 hours (unless indicated otherwise). Following LPS stimulation and antigen loading, 2 × 10 5 CFSE-labeled P14 cells were added to each well and cocultured with DC in complete RPMI media. Media was replaced once 2 days following coculture. On day 3, cell culture was collected to assess P14 cell proliferation (by CFSE dilution) and activation (by CD44/CD69 upregulation or CD62L downregulation) by flow cytometry. Note, we could not detect robust GP33-specific CD8 + T cell responses with either in vitro ( Figure S3 C) or in vivo ( Figures S3 D–S3F) assays, which was unlike what we observed in NINJA-expressing tumors ( Connolly et al., 2021 19. Connolly, K.A. ∙ Kuchroo, M. ∙ Venkat, A. ... A reservoir of stem-like CD8 + T cells in the tumor-draining lymph node preserves the ongoing antitumor immune response Sci. Immunol. 2021; 6 :eabg7836 Google Scholar ; Damo et al., 2021 24. Damo, M. ∙ Fitzgerald, B. ∙ Lu, Y. ... Inducible de novo expression of neoantigens in tumor cells and mice Nat. Biotechnol. 2021; 39 :64-73 Google Scholar ; Fitzgerald et al., 2021 34. Fitzgerald, B. ∙ Connolly, K.A. ∙ Cui, C. ... A mouse model for the study of anti-tumor T cell responses in Kras-driven lung adenocarcinoma Cell Rep Methods. 2021; 1 :100080 Google Scholar ). This was not a technical breakdown, as the proviral sequence from KP-HELLO tumor cell line was correct ( Figure S3 B) and GP 61-80 was presented to SMARTA CD4 T cells ( Figure 2 C).
Fractions of different cell types were estimated with CIBERSORT ( Newman et al., 2015 96. Newman, A.M. ∙ Liu, C.L. ∙ Green, M.R. ... Robust enumeration of cell subsets from tissue expression profiles Nat. Methods. 2015; 12 :453-457 Google Scholar ), a cell type deconvolution program that derives cell type-specific abundances from bulk RNA-seq data. Here bulk RNA-seq data were downloaded from the whole TCGA LUAD cohort. Among the 594 samples with FPKM data, the first sample was used for each series of primary tumor samples. In total, 513 samples of primary tumor from different cases were selected for deconvolution. Reference marker gene expression profile (GEP) matrix was assigned with a widely used leukocyte signature matrix LM22 ( Newman et al., 2015 96. Newman, A.M. ∙ Liu, C.L. ∙ Green, M.R. ... Robust enumeration of cell subsets from tissue expression profiles Nat. Methods. 2015; 12 :453-457 Google Scholar ) provided by CIBERSORT program. Quantile normalization was disabled, and 100 permutations were used as default to calculate P values. From 22 cell subsets of CIBERSORT output using LM22 matrix, “B cells naïve,” “B cells memory” and “plasma cells” were combined as “B cell lineage”; “T cells CD4 memory resting” and “T cells CD4 memory activated” were combined as “CD4 memory T cells”; “NK cells resting” and “NK cells activated” were combined as “NK cells”; “macrophages M0,” “macrophages M1,” and “macrophages M2” were combined as “macrophages”; “dendritic cells resting” and “dendritic cells activated” were combined as “dendritic cells”; “mast cells resting” and “mast cells activated” were combined as “mast cells.”
Data was downloaded from GEO with accession code GSE131907 ( Kim et al., 2020 66. Kim, N. ∙ Kim, H.K. ∙ Lee, K. ... Single-cell RNA sequencing demonstrates the molecular and cellular reprogramming of metastatic lung adenocarcinoma Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :2285 Google Scholar ). The raw UMI count matrix and annotations were used. Data normalization and analysis were performed with R package Seurat (version 3.1.0) and only cells from lungs or lymph nodes were used with original annotations “nLung,” “tLung,” “nLN,” or “mLN.” For the analysis of CD4 + T cells and B cells, 49,901 cells with original annotation “T/NK cells” and 22,592 cells with original annotations “B lymphocytes” were selected for the following analysis. UMI counts were log-normalized using function NormalizeData with parameter normalization.method set to “LogNormalize.” PCA was run based on the normalized data and clusters were called with FindNeighbors and FindClusters using the top 20 PCs and resolution set to 0.5 or 0.25 for T/NK cells or B cells, respectively. For both T/NK cells and B cells, dimension reduction and visualization were performed with UMAP using the top 15 PCs. Relative abundances for marker genes were calculated as Z-scaled average of log2(RC+1), where RC is relative counts that is calculated with NormalizeData and normalization.method set to “RC.”
Survival analysis and pairwise correlation analysis of gene expression signatures were performed using web server GEPIA2 ( Tang et al., 2019 136. Tang, Z. ∙ Kang, B. ∙ Li, C. ... GEPIA2: an enhanced web server for large-scale expression profiling and interactive analysis Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 :W556-W560 Google Scholar ), based on TCGA and GTEx databases. 478 LUAD tumor samples were included in survival analysis. We established gene expression signatures for GC B cells and TFH cells based on previous human studies in lymphoid tissues and cancers ( Cabrita et al., 2020 13. Cabrita, R. ∙ Lauss, M. ∙ Sanna, A. ... Tertiary lymphoid structures improve immunotherapy and survival in melanoma Nature. 2020; 577 :561-565 Google Scholar ; Cillo et al., 2020 18.

Clin. Invest. 2019; 129 :3185-3200 Google Scholar ), and refined them based on the data in Figures 1 D and 1E to reflect the gene expression of GC B cells and TFH cells in LUAD. For each signature gene set, LUAD cohort was divided into high and low expression groups by median value (50% cut-off). GC B cell: AICDA, BATF, BACH2, BCL6, CD79A, CD79B, CD86, DOCK8, IRF4, IRF8, MYC. TFH: ASCL2, BCL6, CD4, CD200, CXCR5, IL4, IL21, IL6ST, MAF, PDCD1, SH2D1A, TOX2. Th1: BHLHE40, CXCR3, CD4, IFNG, IL2, IL12RB2, STAT4, TBX21 . CD8 effector cell: CD8A, CD8B, CX3CR1, GZMA, GZMB, KLRG1, PRF1, ZEB2 . Th17: CD4, IL6R, IL17A, IL17F, IL23R, RORA, RORC, STAT3 . NK cell: CD160, CD244, GNLY, GZMB, KLRC3, KLRF1, NKG2A, NKG7 . Survival analyses were performed with log-rank Mantel-Cox test. Pairwise correlation analyses of gene expression signature were performed with two-tailed Pearson correlation test.
Prism 9 (GraphPad software) was used for quantification and statistical analysis. Methods of statistical analysis, number of mice used per experiment per group, number of experimental repeats and P values were indicated in figure legends. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
