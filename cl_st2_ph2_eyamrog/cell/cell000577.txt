Title: LGR5 expressing skin fibroblasts define a major cellular hub perturbed in scleroderma


Abstract: Summary

Systemic sclerosis (scleroderma, SSc) is an incurable autoimmune disease with high morbidity and mortality rates. Here, we conducted a population-scale single-cell genomic analysis of skin and blood samples of 56 healthy controls and 97 SSc patients at different stages of the disease. We found immune compartment dysfunction only in a specific subtype of diffuse SSc patients but global dysregulation of the stromal compartment, particularly in a previously undefined subset of LGR5 + -scleroderma-associated fibroblasts (ScAFs). ScAFs are perturbed morphologically and molecularly in SSc patients. Single-cell multiome profiling of stromal cells revealed ScAF-specific markers, pathways, regulatory elements, and transcription factors underlining disease development. Systematic analysis of these molecular features with clinical metadata associates specific ScAF targets with disease pathogenesis and SSc clinical traits. Our high-resolution atlas of the sclerodermatous skin spectrum will enable a paradigm shift in the understanding of SSc disease and facilitate the development of biomarkers and therapeutic strategies.

Section: Introduction

Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a rare chronic autoimmune disease that primarily affects women between 30 and 50 years old with high morbidity and mortality rates greater than those of any other rheumatic disease ( Bhattacharyya et al., 2011 7. Bhattacharyya, S. ∙ Wei, J. ∙ Varga, J. Understanding fibrosis in systemic sclerosis: shifting paradigms, emerging opportunities Nat. Rev. Rheumatol. 2011; 8 :42-54 Google Scholar ; Allanore et al., 2015 1. Allanore, Y. ∙ Simms, R. ∙ Distler, O. ... Systemic sclerosis Nat. Rev. Dis. Primers. 2015; 1 :15002 Google Scholar ). SSc involves a broad spectrum of clinical features that encompass vascular, immune, and fibrotic manifestations affecting the skin and internal organs ( Trojanowska, 2010 50. Trojanowska, M. Cellular and molecular aspects of vascular dysfunction in systemic sclerosis Nat. Rev. Rheumatol. 2010; 6 :453-460 Google Scholar ; Denton and Khanna, 2017 15. Denton, C.P. ∙ Khanna, D. Systemic sclerosis Lancet. 2017; 390 :1685-1699 Google Scholar ). A striking feature of SSc is the heterogeneity in patients’ clinical manifestations, autoantibody profiles, rate of disease progression, response to treatment, and survival ( Allanore et al., 2015 1. Allanore, Y. ∙ Simms, R. ∙ Distler, O. ... Systemic sclerosis Nat. Rev. Dis. Primers. 2015; 1 :15002 Google Scholar ). Skin fibrosis, the distinguishing hallmark of SSc, allows the classification of patients into two major subsets: limited cutaneous SSc (lSSc), confined distally to the elbows, knees, or face and diffuse cutaneous SSc (dSSc), also involving the proximal portion of the extremities as well as the trunk and face. It remains uncertain whether these two subsets represent distinct molecular diseases or merely reflect two extremes on the disease spectrum. Both the SSc subsets may involve visceral organs, including the lungs, gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, and heart ( Denton and Khanna, 2017 15. Denton, C.P. ∙ Khanna, D. Systemic sclerosis Lancet. 2017; 390 :1685-1699 Google Scholar ), and the degree of skin thickness score correlates with organ involvements ( Matsuda et al., 2019 38. Matsuda, K.M. ∙ Yoshizaki, A. ∙ Kuzumi, A. ... Skin thickness score as a surrogate marker of organ involvements in systemic sclerosis: a retrospective observational study Arthritis Res. Ther. 2019; 21 :129 Google Scholar ).
Immunological abnormalities of the innate and adaptive immune system have long been recognized in SSc. These include chronic mononuclear cell infiltration into affected tissues, increased peripheral blood monocyte count, dysregulation of chemokines, cytokines, and diverse growth factors ( York, 2011 54. York, M.R. Novel insights on the role of the innate immune system in systemic sclerosis Expert Rev. Clin. Immunol. 2011; 7 :481-489 Google Scholar ; Pattanaik et al., 2015 41. Pattanaik, D. ∙ Brown, M. ∙ Postlethwaite, B.C. ... Pathogenesis of systemic sclerosis Front. Immunol. 2015; 6 :272 Google Scholar ; Kania et al., 2019 28. Kania, G. ∙ Rudnik, M. ∙ Distler, O. Involvement of the myeloid cell compartment in fibrogenesis and systemic sclerosis Nat. Rev. Rheumatol. 2019; 15 :288-302 Google Scholar ). A recent single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) study ( Gaydosik et al., 2021 19. Gaydosik, A.M. ∙ Tabib, T. ∙ Domsic, R. ... Single-cell transcriptome analysis identifies skin-specific T-cell responses in systemic sclerosis Ann. Rheum. Dis. 2021; 80 :1453-1460 Google Scholar ) identified perturbations in CXCL13 + T cells in the SSc skin. Autoimmunity in SSc is best exemplified by the presence of multiple specific autoantibodies, such as the anti-topoisomerase1 (Scl-70), anticentromere, and anti-RNA polymerase III antibodies, enriched in distinct clinical subsets ( Kayser and Fritzler, 2015 29. Kayser, C. ∙ Fritzler, M.J. Autoantibodies in systemic sclerosis: unanswered questions Front. Immunol. 2015; 6 :167 Google Scholar ). However, given the limited impact of canonical immunomodulatory therapies on SSc progression, the contribution of the immune compartment to disease initiation and/or disease maintenance remains an open question.
Despite the fibrotic nature of SSc, the precise molecular profiles of the skin stromal cell compartment, which consists of fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, blood vessels, and pericytes, are not fully elucidated. Skin fibrosis can occur as part of the natural wound-healing process upon injury ( Eming et al., 2017 17. Eming, S.A. ∙ Wynn, T.A. ∙ Martin, P. Inflammation and metabolism in tissue repair and regeneration Science. 2017; 356 :1026-1030 Google Scholar ) or because of diseases, such as SSc or graft versus host disease (GVHD) ( Strong Rodrigues et al., 2018 46. Strong Rodrigues, K. ∙ Oliveira-Ribeiro, C. ∙ de Abreu Fiuza Gomes, S. ... Cutaneous graft-versus-host disease: diagnosis and treatment Am. J. Clin. Dermatol. 2018; 19 :33-50 Google Scholar ). Stromal cells’ contribution to SSc was studied as early as the 1970s, focusing specifically on myofibroblasts ( Gabbiani et al., 1972 18. Gabbiani, G. ∙ Hirschel, B.J. ∙ Ryan, G.B. ... Granulation tissue as a contractile organ: study of structure and function J. Exp. Med. 1972; 135 :719-734 Google Scholar ; Hinz and Lagares, 2020 23. Hinz, B. ∙ Lagares, D. Evasion of apoptosis by myofibroblasts: a hallmark of fibrotic diseases Nat. Rev. Rheumatol. 2020; 16 :11-31 Google Scholar ). Recently, scRNA-seq studies described heterogeneity within subsets of fibroblasts in normal and aging skin, following wound healing, and in the skin and lungs of SSc patients ( Philippeos et al., 2018 42.

However, the comprehensive scRNA-seq profiling of skin samples from large SSc patient cohorts encompassing the diverse clinical spectrum of SSc has never been done. Furthermore, the major drivers and fundamental mechanisms regulating fibrosis in SSc remain largely unknown.
Here, we report the first population-scale scRNA-seq profiling of skin biopsies derived from the dorsal forearm of 56 healthy controls and 97 lSSc and dSSc patients at different stages of disease progression and from an additional 10 patients with other fibrotic skin diseases (e.g., the sclerodermatous type of GVHD and localized scleroderma [morphea]). Although SSc is considered to be an immune-mediated disease, we did not find consistent immune perturbations shared across patients; rather, we found that changes in immune cell composition were confined to a specific subtype of dSSc patients with early disease or a high skin score. In striking contrast, most dSSc patients shared global and systemic perturbations in the stromal cell compartment. We defined 10 skin fibroblast cell states from healthy and SSc patients based on the different expressions of gene modules and signaling pathways, pointing toward diverse functions including skin maintenance, ECM remodeling, fibrosis, and immune modulation. A fibroblast subset defined by the expression of the LGR5 receptor, which we term scleroderma-associated fibroblasts (ScAFs), was significantly diminished in the dSSc patients compared with that in the lSSc patients and healthy donors. Importantly, the remaining ScAFs of the SSc patients express both known and unknown SSc driver genes and pathways associated with excessive ECM deposition and reduced ECM degradation, activation of complement and coagulation systems, the modulation and proliferation of blood vessels, and the activation of cellular senescence and profibrotic signaling pathways. Combining single-cell sequencing assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (scATAC-seq) with scRNA-seq from the same individual cells, we revealed the major coordinators of the transition of healthy to pathological ScAFs. We found that the open chromatin regions in SSc patients are enriched with AP-1 motifs (including ATF3, JUN, FOS, FOSL, and JDP2) and other transcription factors (TF, e.g., BACH1, MAFK, and TEAD1/3). Using 3D whole-mount single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) analysis, we discovered that ScAFs in the healthy skin are scattered mainly in the deep reticular dermis and are largely perturbed in their number and morphology in SSc. We further showed that ScAFs display a large number of ligand-receptor interactions with the skin immune and stromal compartment. In summary, coupling population-scale scRNA-seq with detailed clinical metadata identifies a distinct LGR5-expressing fibroblast subset (ScAFs) as the central axis of perturbation in SSc patients. Targeted therapies directed against these ScAF pathways might begin a new era for SSc therapies.

Section: Results

To better understand the SSc pathogenesis and characterize the immune and stromal cell function and diversity in SSc patients, we designed a robust protocol for massively parallel single-cell RNA-sequencing (MARS-seq) ( Jaitin et al., 2014 24. Jaitin, D.A. ∙ Kenigsberg, E. ∙ Keren-Shaul, H. ... Massively parallel single-cell RNA-seq for marker-free decomposition of tissues into cell types Science. 2014; 343 :776-779 Google Scholar ; Keren-Shaul et al., 2019 30. Keren-Shaul, H. ∙ Kenigsberg, E. ∙ Jaitin, D.A. ... MARS-seq2.0: an experimental and analytical pipeline for indexed sorting combined with single-cell RNA sequencing Nat. Protoc. 2019; 14 :1841-1862 Google Scholar ) to characterize whole skin tissue biopsies derived from the mid-forearm of SSc patients and age-matched healthy controls with no medical morbidities ( Figure 1 A; STAR Methods ). Our design focused on maintaining the in situ cellular and molecular composition of each sample by instantly cooling the skin and blood samples, enzymatically and mechanically dissociating the skin, and immediately sorting the blood and skin immune cells (CD45 + ) as well as skin stromal cells (Thy-1/CD90 + ) for MARS-seq analysis ( Figures 1 A and S1 ; STAR Methods ). In order to comprehensively map the full spectrum of SSc disease, we recruited a heterogeneous cohort of SSc patients with diverse demographic characterizations, disease stages, and clinical manifestations ( Table S1 ; STAR Methods ).
To better define the role of the immune system in SSc, we first analyzed the blood and skin immune cells. We profiled a total of 67,156 quality control (QC)-positive ( STAR Methods ) blood and skin immune cells derived from 86 SSc patients (38 lSSc and 48 dSSc) with diverse clinical manifestations, and 35 healthy donors ( Figures S2 A and S2B; Table S2 ). We used the MetaCell algorithm ( STAR Methods ) to identify the homogeneous and robust groups of cells based on the cluster-specific expression patterns of the 2,202 most variable genes, resulting in a detailed map of 385 meta cells organized into 8 broad immune cell lineages ( Figures 1 B, 1C, and S2 C). A two-dimensional projection of all immune single cells revealed separation into diverse cell types and states, based on lineage-specific marker genes ( Figures 1 D and 1E). This immune atlas consisted of T cells, including blood and skin effector T cells (T_Effector and sT_Effector, respectively), regulatory T cells (Treg, sTreg, and sTreg_CXCR4), γδ T cells (T_GD), and blood and skin naive T cells (T_naive and sT), all characterized by a high expression of CD3 . The immune atlas also contained subsets of NK cells (NK, NK_XCL1, and NK_XCL1_CXCR4), plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs and pDC_CXCR4), conventional dendritic cells (DCs, DC_CCL22, DC_CXCL10, and DC_XCR1), macrophages (Mf and MF_TREM2), monocytes (Mo, Mo_CD16, M_IL1B, and M_CD16_IL1B), Langerhans cells (LCs), mast cells (Mast and Mast_CLC), B cells (B and B_CXCR4), and plasma cells. Many myeloid and lymphoid subsets were predominantly found in the skin, including the DC subsets, LCs, skin effector and regulatory T cells, Mf, mast cells, and subsets of NK cells, while the other immune subsets were predominantly found in the blood ( Figures 1 C and 1F). Further comparison of the skin and blood immune cells showed molecular differences between the blood and skin immune subsets and provided insights into immune cell adaptations to the skin tissue and its intrinsic activation properties ( Figures S2 D–S2H).
To estimate alterations in the immune compartment between SSc patients and healthy subjects, we performed differential composition analysis between SSc patients and healthy donor blood and skin immune cells. We visualized the results by computing the 2D density of the projected cells from each paired group, controlling for the number of cells and patients ( STAR Methods ). To our surprise given that SSc is considered to be an immune-mediated disease, we did not find major global and consistent changes between SSc patient groups and healthy subjects in blood ( Figures 2 A–2C, S3 A, and S3B) or skin ( Figures 2 A, 2D, 2E, S3 C, and S3D) immune subsets.
Since SSc is a heterogeneous disease with several patient subtypes and progression phases that are potentially associated with the molecular patterns of disease, we proceeded with a sub-analysis of the blood and skin immune cells based on the patient’s metadata, including disease subtype (lSSc versus dSSc), duration (early ≤3 years versus long ≥10 years), activity (high skin score ≥20 versus low ≤10), and autoantibody status. We found significant (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, two-sided) changes in immune compositions in several subsets of SSc patients, primarily in the skin of dSSc patients with early or active disease ( Figures 2 B–2E and S3 A–S3D; STAR Methods ). In the blood, we observed a decrease in naive T cells in both the SSc groups and an increase in classical and non-classical (CD16 + ) monocytes mainly in the dSSc patients, consistent with previous studies ( Lescoat et al., 2017 34. Lescoat, A. ∙ Lecureur, V. ∙ Roussel, M. ... CD16-positive circulating monocytes and fibrotic manifestations of systemic sclerosis Clin. Rheumatol. 2017; 36 :1649-1654 Google Scholar ; Kania et al., 2019 28. Kania, G. ∙ Rudnik, M. ∙ Distler, O. Involvement of the myeloid cell compartment in fibrogenesis and systemic sclerosis Nat. Rev. Rheumatol. 2019; 15 :288-302 Google Scholar ). We also found increased DCs in dSSc patients with long disease duration or with a low skin score, increased pDCs in patients with a high skin score, and increased plasma cells in early dSSc disease compared with those in the other study groups ( Figure S3 A). In the skin, we observed an increase in IFN-γ-producing T effector cells mainly in the dSSc patients ( Figures 2 D and 2E), an increase in skin cytotoxic NK cells specifically in the dSSc patients with an early disease or with a high skin score, increased pDC, non-classical monocytes, and plasma cells in the dSSc patients with a high skin score, and decreased DC in the patients with early dSSc ( Figure S3 C). Interestingly, we found strong correlations between specific autoantibody levels and immune cell subsets, including associations between anti-RNA polymerase III and relatively high levels of skin DCs, and between anti-topoisomerase1 (Scl-70) and relatively high levels of blood monocytes and skin T effectors ( Figures S3 B and S3D). Finally, differential gene expression analysis between the immune compartments of SSc patients and healthy subjects revealed molecular perturbations associated with different immune subsets ( Figures S3 E–S3H; STAR Methods ). In summary, we identified immune cell composition changes associated with specific disease subtype, duration, severity, and autoantibody status, suggesting a complex and heterogenous immune involvement across the SSc disease stages.
The precise molecular definition and functions of the human skin fibroblasts and other stromal cell populations remain only partially characterized ( Lemos and Duffield, 2018 33.

Med. 2018; 10 :eaan5174 Google Scholar ; Philippeos et al., 2018 42. Philippeos, C. ∙ Telerman, S.B. ∙ Oulès, B. ... Spatial and single-cell transcriptional profiling identifies functionally distinct human dermal fibroblast subpopulations J. Invest. Dermatol. 2018; 138 :811-825 Google Scholar ; Tabib et al., 2018 49. Tabib, T. ∙ Morse, C. ∙ Wang, T. ... SFRP2/DPP4 and FMO1/LSP1 define major fibroblast populations in human skin J. Invest. Dermatol. 2018; 138 :802-810 Google Scholar , 2021 48. Tabib, T. ∙ Huang, M. ∙ Morse, N. ... Myofibroblast transcriptome indicates SFRP2 hi fibroblast progenitors in systemic sclerosis skin Nat. Commun. 2021; 12 :4384 Google Scholar ). To provide a detailed and high-resolution atlas of the skin stromal cells in healthy and SSc patients, we used a broad flow cytometry gating strategy, using the cell surface marker Thy-1/CD90 to label and enrich for stromal cells in the skin. Single-cell analysis using CD45 − CD90 − gating to investigate potentially relevant CD90 − stromal cells confirms that CD45 − CD90 − skin cells are mainly composed of epithelial cells, pericytes, and less than 1% of fibroblasts ( Figures S4 A and S4B). Therefore, we concluded that our Thy-1 gating strategy is optimal for sampling the non-epithelial stromal cells from skin biopsies.
We profiled a total of 64,152 QC-positive CD90 + skin stromal cells derived from 94 SSc patients (42 lSSc and 52 dSSc) and 50 age-matched healthy donors ( Figure S4 C; Table S2 ; STAR Methods ). Metacell analysis divided the skin stromal compartment into 292 metacells, organized into 8 broad lineages including fibroblasts, pericytes, vascular endothelial cells, and cells of different epidermal and neuronal origins (e.g., melanocytes, keratinocytes, and nerves; Figures 3 A–3C and S4 D–S4F). The fibroblasts formed a highly diverse group of transcriptional states consisting of 228 metacells. We further annotated the fibroblast metacells by examining the 559 most variable genes, resulting in the de novo characterization of 10 distinct fibroblasts subsets ( Figures 3 D, 3E, and S4 G).
Our deep characterization of skin fibroblasts highlighted COCH -expressing fibroblasts (Fibro_COCH), recently discovered as one of the major fibroblast subsets in the skin ( Ascensión et al., 2021 2. Ascensión, A.M. ∙ Fuertes-Álvarez, S. ∙ Ibañez-Solé, O. ... Human dermal fibroblast subpopulations are conserved across single-cell RNA sequencing studies J. Invest. Dermatol. 2021; 141 :1735-1744.e35 Google Scholar ), which express specific ECM components and assembly genes (e.g., COCH, ASPN , and MMP16 ), genes of endocrine components (e.g., DIO 2 , PTH1R , IRS2 , and PCSK1N ), and genes associated with neural development (e.g., GAP43, MAB21L2, and NCAM1 ). Another fibroblast subset was annotated by its high expression of PTGDS (Fibro_PTGDS), a gene important in prostaglandins (PGs) synthesis. Interestingly, these fibroblasts also highly express genes associated with antigen presentation, such as the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I ( B2M , HLA-A , HLA-B , HLA-C , HLA-F , and HLA-H ) and MHC class II ( CD74 ), and important immune cytokine and chemokine genes, such as IL32 , IL33 , CCL19 , and CXCL12 .
Two additional fibroblast populations expressed the marker gene MYOC (Fibro_MYOC1 and Fibro_MYOC2) encoding for proteins associated with assembly and disassembly of actin filaments and smooth muscle relaxation (e.g., MYOC and HSPB6 ). The Fibro_MYOC2 subset expressed the C7 gene, which encodes a subunit of the membrane attack complex (MAC) and other complement component genes (e.g., CFD , CFH , and C3 ). Both the populations express genes important for adipogenesis, lipid metabolism, and protection against oxidative stress (e.g., APOC1 , APOD/E , GPX3 , and MGST1 ). Myofibroblasts (Fibro_ACTA2), highly expressing gene modules of both fibroblast (e.g., COL1A1 , COL3A1 , COL5A1/2 , COL8A2 , and COL11A1 ) and smooth muscle cells (e.g., ACTA2 and MYL4 ), are considered key effector cells in SSc ( Gabbiani et al., 1972 18. Gabbiani, G. ∙ Hirschel, B.J. ∙ Ryan, G.B. ... Granulation tissue as a contractile organ: study of structure and function J. Exp. Med. 1972; 135 :719-734 Google Scholar ; Denton and Khanna, 2017 15. Denton, C.P. ∙ Khanna, D. Systemic sclerosis Lancet. 2017; 390 :1685-1699 Google Scholar ) but in our analysis comprised only a small fraction (on average 1.05%) of skin fibroblasts.
Interestingly, we identified a highly abundant, uncharacterized fibroblast subset (29.1% ± 4.5% of all fibroblasts in healthy subjects, 95% confidence interval) expressing LGR5 . LGR5 is a leucine-rich repeat-containing receptor for R-spondins that activates the canonical Wnt signaling pathway and acts as a stem cell marker of the intestinal epithelium and skin hair follicle ( Barker et al., 2007 4. Barker, N. ∙ van Es, J.H. ∙ Kuipers, J. ... Identification of stem cells in small intestine and colon by marker gene Lgr5 Nature. 2007; 449 :1003-1007 Google Scholar ; Jaks et al., 2008 25. Jaks, V. ∙ Barker, N. ∙ Kasper, M. ... Lgr5 marks cycling, yet long-lived, hair follicle stem cells Nat. Genet. 2008; 40 :1291-1299 Google Scholar ). Similar to myofibroblasts and MYOC expressing fibroblasts, the LGR5 + fibroblasts express a large gene module involved in the contractile system of smooth muscle and genes important during wound healing (e.g., MYL6 , TPM1 , ACTB , and ACTG1 ) in addition to genes encoding for unique ECM components (e.g., COL12A1 , MFAP5 , PRG4 , CILP , SPARC , and LUM ) ( Figures 3 D and 3E; Table S3 ). The LGR5 + fibroblast subset overexpresses many genes associated with ECM degradation and skin remodeling, including metalloproteinase MMP2 and its inhibitors TIMP2 , the dipeptidyl peptidase IV ( DPP4/CD26 ), and the secretory leukocyte peptidase inhibitor ( SLPI ), along with other ECM remodeling/assembly genes ( Table S3 ). Additionally, this subset also highly expresses complement regulatory genes (e.g., CD55 , CD59 , and CLU ), which prevent complement activation and generation of the MAC, genes associated with vascular formation and remodeling, platelet aggregation, and coagulation (e.g., ANGPTL1/2 , CTHRC1 , PTGIS , THBS2 , CD248 , PDGFRB/L , and ANXA5 ) as well as genes important for iron storage and delivery (e.g., FTH1 and SCARA5 ). The LGR5 + fibroblasts express high levels of the Annexin gene family and VAT1 gene, which both play a key role in the trafficking, organization, and exocytosis of vesicles critical for cell-cell communication. Finally, the LGR5 + fibroblasts express unique atypical chemokine receptors, including ACKR3 , which encodes a receptor for chemokines CXCL11, CXCL12, and opioids ( Burns et al., 2006 10. Burns, J.M. ∙ Summers, B.C. ∙ Wang, Y. ... A novel chemokine receptor for SDF-1 and I-TAC involved in cell survival, cell adhesion, and tumor development J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203 :2201-2213 Google Scholar ; Meyrath et al., 2020 40. Meyrath, M. ∙ Szpakowska, M. ∙ Zeiner, J. ... The atypical chemokine receptor ACKR3/CXCR7 is a broad-spectrum scavenger for opioid peptides Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :3033 Google Scholar ).
Overall, our comprehensive analysis revealed a remarkable degree of functional heterogeneity within skin fibroblasts, including an LGR5 expressing fibroblast subset. Skin fibroblasts express gene modules of diverse functions far exceeding their role as matrix-producing reparative cells, reflecting a wide range of potential functions in fibrosis, inflammation, immune responses, metabolism, angiogenesis, vascular and blood pressure modulation, coagulation, and neurogenesis ( Figure 3 E).
Following the generation of a population-level high-resolution cell atlas of healthy and SSc patients’ skin, we searched for significant changes in stromal cell populations and signaling pathways during SSc disease progression. Comparing the stromal cell compartment of SSc patients (42 lSSc and 52 dSSc) with that of healthy subjects (n = 50), we found significant perturbations in fibroblasts, vascular, and pericyte lineages at both the individual and group levels ( Figures 4 A–4C, and S5 A; STAR Methods ). Strikingly, the most significant changes in the fibroblast lineage were observed in the LGR5 + fibroblast subpopulation, which are substantially reduced in the dSSc patients compared with those in healthy subjects and lSSc patients ( Figures 4 A–4C and S5 A); hence, we define this cell population as ScAFs. Progressive reduction in ScAFs was observed from the early to late stages of the dSSc disease, with the strongest reduction in patients with an early disease or high skin score and in part of the lSSc patients ( Figures S5 A and S5B). To evaluate if ScAF perturbation is a specific aspect of the SSc fibrotic process or potentially a more general mechanism of loss of tissue structure, we conducted a single-cell analysis of 6 patients with a related fibrotic skin disease, GVHD (5 with sclerodermatous type and 1 with lichenoid type) and 4 patients with localized scleroderma (morphea), and identified a similar perturbation of the ScAF in patients with the sclerodermatous type of GVHD ( Figures S5 C and S5D). We further validated the perturbation of ScAF in SSc by profiling the stromal cells in the skin of families containing both healthy subjects and SSc patients ( Figure S5 E). In addition to the reduction of ScAF, we also revealed significant perturbations in other fibroblast populations, including decreased MYOC subsets 1 and increased MYOC subsets 2 in SSc patients compared with healthy subjects ( Figures 4 A–4C and S5 A). Finally, we found a significant increase in the fraction of vascular endothelial cells (expressing CD74 and ACKR1 /RBP7 ) and pericytes (expressing RGS5 and TGFBI ), mainly in the dSSc patients with a high skin score compared with other groups (p < 0.05, Figures 4 A–4C and S5 A).
To define molecular perturbations within cell subpopulations in lSSc and dSSc patients, we computed differentially expressed genes between the different SSc groups and healthy subjects for every fibroblast subset ( STAR Methods ). The most substantial transcriptional changes in the fibroblast lineage were observed in the ScAF subset of the dSSc patients ( Figures 4 D–4F). In addition to significant downregulation of the LGR5 gene itself in the remaining LGR5 + cells sampled from dSSc patients, we identified (mainly in the earlier disease stages) many perturbations in genes and signaling pathways implicated in key pathophysiological processes that drive SSc: fibrosis, vasculopathy, and inflammation ( Figures 4 E, 4F, and S5 F; Table S3 ). The substantial differences in gene expression of the ScAFs of dSSc patients included upregulation of genes associated with excessive production and deposition of specific ECM components (e.g., COL1A1 , COL3A1 , COL5A1,2 , EFEMP1 , BGN , POSTN , and COMP ) in parallel with the inhibition of ECM breakdown and uncontrolled tissue proteases activity (upregulation of the SERPINH1 , SERPINE2 , and PRSS23 genes and the downregulation of the SLPI and TIMP2 genes). Additionally, the ScAFs derived from the dSSc and lSSc patients shared activated profibrotic signaling programs, including genes associated with the type I IFN signature, TGF-β pathway, and IL1 pathway. Differential regulation of the Wnt signaling associated genes (upregulation: SFRP4 and DKK3 ; downregulation: WISP2 ), IGF1 signaling associated genes ( IGF1 and IGFBP4 ), and genes encoding for the CCN family proteins (an acronym for CYR61 , CTGF , and NOV ), which constitute a signaling hub associated with fibrosis ( Jun and Lau, 2011 27. Jun, J.Il. ∙ Lau, L.F. Taking aim at the extracellular matrix: CCN proteins as emerging therapeutic targets Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2011; 10 :945-963 Google Scholar ), was distinct to dSSc patient ScAFs. Other gene perturbations in the ScAFs of dSSc patients are associated with increased and dysregulated angiogenesis, generation of abnormal leaky vessels, activation of coagulation and platelet aggregation (i.e., THBS1 , PLPP3 , and SERPINH1/SERPINE2 , respectively), and with abnormal inter-cellular communication and vesicle and granule targeting (i.e., GJA1 and RAB31 ). Compared with the ScAFs of the lSSc patients, those of the dSSc patients downregulated genes associated with protection against oxidative damage (e.g., GPX3 , MGST1 , and SCARA5 ) and adipogenesis (e.g., ADIRF ), which correspond to the widespread tissue damage and loss of subcutaneous adipose tissue, respectively, in dSSc patients ( Marangoni and Lu, 2017 37. Marangoni, R.G. ∙ Lu, T.T. The roles of dermal white adipose tissue loss in scleroderma skin fibrosis Curr. Opin. Rheumatol. 2017; 29 :585-590 Google Scholar ).
Interestingly, the ScAFs in the lSSc and early disease dSSc patients significantly overexpressed genes connected with cellular senescence, including cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16 ( CDKN2A ) and CDKN1A (p21) ( Figures 4 E, S5 F, and S7 E–S7G), consistent with previous studies that show evidence for cellular senescence in SSc ( Dumit et al., 2014 16. Dumit, V.I. ∙ Küttner, V. ∙ Käppler, J. ... Altered MCM protein levels and autophagic flux in aged and systemic sclerosis dermal fibroblasts J. Invest. Dermatol. 2014; 134 :2321-2330 Google Scholar ; Lakota and Varga, 2021 31. Lakota, K. ∙ Varga, J. Linking autoimmunity, short telomeres and lung fibrosis in SSc Nat. Rev. Rheumatol. 2021; 17 :511-512 Google Scholar ).
In addition to the ScAFs, we observed signaling perturbations in other fibroblast subsets in the SSc patients, mainly in the MYOC and PTGDS subpopulations ( Figures 4 D and S5 G). These two subsets overexpressed unique genes (e.g., SVEP1 , TIMP1 , METAP2 , TPP1 , CCL19 , and IL33 ) but also share several gene modules with the ScAF subset (e.g., type I IFN and IL1-related genes, CCNs , and ECM-related modules). This resemblance suggests that all of these subsets are affected by the same pathological microenvironment; however, it is also possible that the MYOC and PTGDS subsets transdifferentiate from the ScAFs or compensate for the loss of the LGR5 expressing fibroblasts. Taken together, our analysis defined a distinctive fibroblast subset, ScAFs, which is drastically perturbed both in its abundance and signaling activity in the SSc patients compared with healthy subjects and within the SSc subgroups. The ScAF subset, mainly in the dSSc patients, expresses many genes critical for fibrosis and other essential aspects of SSc pathogenesis and may define a potential molecular diagnostic and therapeutic tool for SSc patients.
Since ScAFs are strongly associated molecularly with SSc pathogenesis, we proceeded with in vivo characterization of the ScAF accessible chromatin regions and TF regulatory circuits and their perturbation in SSc. For this purpose, we performed single-cell genome-wide multiome profiling of fresh fibroblasts including ScAFs and other stromal cells derived from the affected skin of 9 dSSc patients (7/9 with skin score ≥20 and 3/9 with disease duration <1 year) and 9 healthy subjects, simultaneously recovering the mRNA and accessible chromatin regions (by ATAC-seq) from the same individual cells ( Figures 4 G, S6 A, and S6B). We obtained 6,710 and 2,417 QC-positive cells containing both RNA and ATAC signals from the healthy and dSSc samples, respectively. Using label transferring from our RNA cellular reference map, we assigned these cells to predefined clusters, overall retrieving 2,083 ScAFs. The ATAC signal revealed that the same stromal cell subsets identified by RNA expression signatures are also defined by unique chromatin accessible regions ( Figure 4 H).
To assess the gene regulation programs in skin stromal cells, we computed differential ATAC peaks across individual skin stromal cell populations from healthy subjects. DNA motif enrichment analysis on these peaks revealed that these programs are orchestrated by dedicated TF circuits uniquely expressed in the relevant cell subset ( Figure S6 C). We then compared the ATAC peaks of individual skin stromal cell populations from the dSSc patients with those of healthy subjects. We detected limited changes at promoter regions (287 regions) but substantial differences at distal chromatin open regions (5,016 regions). These differential regulatory regions are enriched for genes perturbed in the different fibroblast subsets, e.g., LGR5 , CDKN2A , and SLPI/MATN 4 in the ScAFs ( Figure 4 I). DNA motif scanning on the differential regions revealed the 63 most significantly overrepresented motifs contributing to the skin stromal cell gene perturbation in dSSc disease ( Figure 4 J). We found that the DNA motifs for ATF3, JUN, and CREB1 are highly enriched in pathogenic ScAFs ( Figure 4 J), while regions containing TWIST1, HAND2, MXI1, NEUROD1, PRRX1, and PRRX2 motifs were specifically and significantly repressed in ScAFs from the dSSc patients compared with those from healthy and other skin stromal cells ( Figures 4 J and S6 C–S6E). Some enriched motifs in the pathogenic ScAFs are common to other fibroblast subsets in SSc, suggesting global TF circuitry perturbation (e.g., FOS, FOSL1/2, BACH1, and JDP2) ( Figure 4 J). In summary, our data uncovered 827 dSSc ScAF-specific regulatory regions that likely play a role in the SSc pathogenicity of ScAFs. These regions are enriched in the AP-1 motifs, highlighting this TF circuit as a major candidate regulator of the transition from healthy to pathogenic ScAFs. Future studies will focus on the exact mechanism that drives healthy ScAFs into the SSc disease state.
The complex communication networks between heterogeneous cell types in tissue are mediated in part through ligand and receptor (L-R) signaling connecting signal-transmitting and -receiving cells ( Zhou et al., 2018 55. Zhou, L. ∙ Todorovic, V. ∙ Kakavas, S. ... Quantitative ligand and receptor binding studies reveal the mechanism of interleukin-36 (IL-36) pathway activation J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293 :403-411 Google Scholar ). Examining L-R pairs in single-cell maps can potentially reveal central cellular components shaping tissue fate ( Camp et al., 2017 11. Camp, J.G. ∙ Sekine, K. ∙ Gerber, T. ... Multilineage communication regulates human liver bud development from pluripotency Nature. 2017; 546 :533-538 Google Scholar ; Cohen et al., 2018 13.

Lung single-cell signaling interaction map reveals basophil role in macrophage imprinting Cell. 2018; 175 :1031-1044.e18 Google Scholar ; Vento-Tormo et al., 2018 53. Vento-Tormo, R. ∙ Efremova, M. ∙ Botting, R.A. ... Single-cell reconstruction of the early maternal-fetal interface in humans Nature. 2018; 563 :347-353 Google Scholar ; Zhou et al., 2018 55. Zhou, L. ∙ Todorovic, V. ∙ Kakavas, S. ... Quantitative ligand and receptor binding studies reveal the mechanism of interleukin-36 (IL-36) pathway activation J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293 :403-411 Google Scholar ). In order to systematically map cellular interactions and reveal potential communication factors linked with SSc pathogenesis, we characterized L-R pairs between ScAFs and other skin cell types in normal and in disease state as described previously ( Vento-Tormo et al., 2018 53. Vento-Tormo, R. ∙ Efremova, M. ∙ Botting, R.A. ... Single-cell reconstruction of the early maternal-fetal interface in humans Nature. 2018; 563 :347-353 Google Scholar ; Figures 5 A and 5B; Table S4 ). We focused on L-R pairs whose ligand or receptor expression was significantly perturbed in SSc patients (Mann-Whitney test, FDR adjusted p < 0.05). Grouping the L-R pairs by functional annotations revealed systemic perturbations in ScAF signaling related to pathways implicated in SSc pathogenesis, including angiogenesis, vascular and blood pressure modulation, coagulation and fibrinolysis, immune dysregulation, complement activation, lipid metabolism, and ECM remodeling ( Figures 5 A and 5B; Table S4 ).
Within the ScAFs of the SSc patients, we observed the upregulation of different ligands recognized by skin vasculature receptors. The over-expression of these ligands is implicated in the increase of endothelial proliferation and migration, blood vessel formation, and tone modulation (via the VEGFB-NRP1/FLT1, THBS1-CD36, and ADM-CALCRL L-R interactions, respectively). Moreover, we detected perturbed signaling resulting in the dysregulation of coagulation and complement activation (e.g., THBS1-SCARB1, F3-TFPI/IL6, F2R-GNAI2, SERPING1-SELP/SELE, and C3-CD46), in line with the vascular aberrations and hypercoagulative state associated with SSc. Importantly, we identified perturbed signaling between the ScAFs of SSc patients and various skin immune cells. For example, the ScAFs of dSSc patients exhibited downregulation of the non-classical MHC class I antigen HLA-E, involved in immune self-non-self-discrimination through inhibition of activation and killing of the NK and effector T cells via its cognate receptors, encoded by KLRD1 and KLRC1 . In addition to their role in the perturbed L-R interactions associated with vascular dysfunction, coagulation, and immune modulation, the ScAFs in SSc patients are key players in other aberrant L-R interactions connected with lipid metabolism (e.g., APOD-LEPR, APOE-SCARB1), matrix deposition (e.g., CTGF-LRP1), and activation of profibrotic signaling, including Wnt and TGFβ signaling (e.g., LGR5-RSPO1/3/4 and TGFBR2-TGFB1, respectively) ( Figures 5 A and 5B; Table S4 ). Perturbations of L-R interactions were also observed in the vascular endothelial cells and pericytes of SSc patients. ( Figure S6 F). Next, we explored the spatial localization of ScAFs in the dermis of healthy subjects and in SSc patients. To visualize ScAFs and spatially localize and quantify them to specific skin niches in both healthy subjects and SSc patients ( Figures 5 C and S7 A), we combined smFISH with immunofluorescent staining in whole-mount skin tissue derived from healthy subjects, lSSc, and dSSc patients ( STAR Methods ). Following the confirmation of a high expression of LGR5 and CD55 proteins in ScAFs by FACS sorting of CD45 − /CD90 + /LGR5 + /CD55 + cells ( Figure S7 B), we stained fixed skin tissue with these ScAF-specific markers ( LGR5 mRNA and the CD55 protein) together with the fibroblast signature gene COL1A1 mRNA ( Figure 5 D; STAR Methods ). Surprisingly, we found that in the healthy skin, the ScAFs are scattered mainly in the deep reticular dermis ( Figures 5 C–5E) and featured long and thin extensions, represented by both CD55 and phalloidin staining of actin filaments ( Figures S7 C and S7D). In the dSSc patients, ScAF abundance and LGR5 expression on ScAFs were significantly reduced, providing orthogonal validation of our scRNA-seq analysis ( Figures 5 D, 5F, and 5G). In addition, we found that ScAFs from the dSSc patients are also morphologically perturbed, losing their elongated extensions ( Figures 5 D and S7 D). Additionally consistent with our scRNA-seq data, we detected upregulation of COL1A1 in dSSc ScAFs as well as in other fibroblasts in the dermis ( Figure 5 D). The lSSc patients displayed intermediate ScAF levels and COL1A1 expression in their deep dermis ( Figure 5 D). We also validated that the ScAFs derived mainly from lSSc patients show significantly elevated levels of the p16 protein ( Figures S7 F and S7G). Taken together, we found that ScAFs participate in many ligand-receptor interactions with the immune and stromal compartments and that perturbation of these interactions is associated with the major SSc pathophysiological processes, suggesting that ScAFs may constitute a signaling hub coordinating cell-cell communication in the healthy skin. The finding that ScAFs localize specifically in the deep reticular dermis of healthy skin and display a protruding structure suggests that they may normally serve as a guidance scaffold to define the correct tissue organization.
SSc is a heterogeneous disease, with variable clinical manifestations encompassing skin fibrosis and other fibrotic traits such as interstitial lung disease (ILD), gastrointestinal (GI) dysmotility and malabsorption, impaired cardiac function, flexion contractures of joints, myopathy, and vascular traits like pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), scleroderma renal crisis (SRC), and digital ulcers (DU) ( Denton and Khanna, 2017 15. Denton, C.P. ∙ Khanna, D. Systemic sclerosis Lancet. 2017; 390 :1685-1699 Google Scholar ; Royle et al., 2018 44. Royle, J.G. ∙ Lanyon, P.C. ∙ Grainge, M.J. ... The incidence, prevalence, and survival of systemic sclerosis in the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink Clin. Rheumatol. 2018; 37 :2103-2111 Google Scholar ). There are currently no standard molecular biomarkers for the prediction of these diverse SSc manifestations. To test whether specific disease manifestations ( Table S1 ) are associated with specific molecular features, we analyzed patients’ cellular and molecular profiles jointly with their clinical features ( STAR Methods ). We found very few associations between immune cell subset gene expression and SSc clinical manifestations but high numbers of clinical disease-related genes linked to skin stromal cells, particularly fibroblasts ( Figure S7 H). Within the fibroblast populations, ScAFs and the MYOC subset 1 population are highly associated with both skin and extra-skin systemic manifestations ( Figures 6 A and 6B). For example, a high skin score is strongly correlated with low ScAF percentage and high RGS5 + pericyte and skin NK cell percentage ( Figures 6 A and 6B).
Focusing on the ScAF subset, we analyzed the genes associated with at least one clinical disease trait and identified 473 upregulated and 280 downregulated genes significantly associated with SSc pathology ( Figure 6 C). These genes make up four major modules: one represents ScAF genes highly expressed in healthy subjects, two include either upregulated or downregulated genes associated with dSSc patients and a high skin score ( Figure 6 C), and one contains upregulated genes shared between lSSc and dSSc patients but with no significant skin score associations ( Figure 6 C). Within these ScAF gene modules, we identified potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets implicated in the key pathophysiological processes of SSc ( Figures 6 C and 6D; Table S5 ). For example, EFEMP1 is highly correlated with dSSc and a higher skin score but also associated with GI manifestations and joint contractures (JCS) in both the SSc groups ( Figure 6 D). Likewise, SMOC2 , which encodes a protein-promoting matrix assembly and endothelial cell proliferation ( Jang et al., 2020 26. Jang, B.G. ∙ Kim, H.S. ∙ Bae, J.M. ... SMOC2, an intestinal stem cell marker, is an independent prognostic marker associated with better survival in colorectal cancers Sci. Rep. 2020; 10 :14591 Google Scholar ), is correlated with dSSc, a higher skin score, DU, and JCS ( Figure 6 D). Finally, IL1R1 , highly expressed in the ScAFs of SSc patients, is not correlated with a disease subset or a skin score but is positively associated with ILD severity, consistent with previous studies that note the importance of the IL-1 pathway in lung fibrosis ( Birnhuber et al., 2019 8. Birnhuber, A. ∙ Crnkovic, S. ∙ Biasin, V. ... IL-1 receptor blockade skews inflammation towards Th2 in a mouse model of systemic sclerosis Eur. Respir. J. 2019; 54 :1900154 Google Scholar ). Interestingly, we further found a positive correlation between IL-1β-producing skin monocytes and ILD ( Figure 6 A). Together, our data illustrate that diverse dermal pathways and cells, specifically the ScAFs, are significantly associated with SSc clinical traits, and these may serve as targets for more effective biomarkers and therapeutic strategies for SSc.

Section: Discussion

In this study, we report a population-scale single-cell genomic analysis of immune and stromal cells derived from blood and skin samples of the entire clinical spectrum of SSc patients and healthy subjects. We observed immune cell compartment changes mainly in subsets of dSSc patients, corresponding with different SSc skin pathology phases (early inflammatory phase with immune activation versus fibrotic phase). Specifically, we found a significant increase in skin NK cells in the dSSc patients with an early disease or with a high skin score, implicating NK cells in disease initiation. In parallel, we observed significant downregulation of the non-classical MHC class I antigen HLA-E on the pathogenic ScAF, which is important for immune self-non-self-discrimination by NK cells. Consistently, a previous study ( Benyamine et al., 2018 5. Benyamine, A. ∙ Magalon, J. ∙ Sabatier, F. ... Natural killer cells exhibit a peculiar phenotypic profile in systemic sclerosis and are potent inducers of endothelial microparticles release Front. Immunol. 2018; 9 :1665 Google Scholar ) highlights the role of NK cells purified from SSc patients as a potent immune inducer of endothelial activation at the early stage of SSc. We further found increased skin pDCs in the dSSc patients with a high skin score. The high IFN I signature present in the blood and affected skin of SSc patients is indicative of the presence of aberrant pDCs. In fact, several studies have confirmed that pDCs largely infiltrate the skin of SSc patients, release high quantities of CXCL4 and IFN-α, and play a major role in determining the severity of the disease ( Carvalheiro et al., 2020 12. Carvalheiro, T. ∙ Zimmermann, M. ∙ Radstake, T.R.D.J. ... Novel insights into dendritic cells in the pathogenesis of systemic sclerosis Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2020; 201 :25-33 Google Scholar ).
Our study reveals highly diverse fibroblasts with gene expression modules reflecting their wide range of critical functions in the healthy and sclerodermatous skin, including skin remodeling, metabolism, immune modulation, angiogenesis, coagulation, and neurogenesis. While other stromal subtypes have been previously implicated as key players in SSc pathogenicity, mainly ɑSMA + myofibroblast ( Gabbiani et al., 1972 18. Gabbiani, G. ∙ Hirschel, B.J. ∙ Ryan, G.B. ... Granulation tissue as a contractile organ: study of structure and function J. Exp. Med. 1972; 135 :719-734 Google Scholar ; Denton and Khanna, 2017 15. Denton, C.P. ∙ Khanna, D. Systemic sclerosis Lancet. 2017; 390 :1685-1699 Google Scholar ), we could not confirm these phenomena in our SSc cohort.
We discovered a discrete fibroblast subset, ScAFs, that displays elongated extensions, potentially important for coordinating the correct tissue organization and homeostasis, similar to other LGR5 -expressing mesenchymal cells ( Lee et al., 2017 32. Lee, J.H. ∙ Tammela, T. ∙ Hofree, M. ... Anatomically and functionally distinct lung mesenchymal populations marked by Lgr5 and Lgr6 Cell. 2017; 170 :1149-1163.e12 Google Scholar ; Halpern et al., 2020 21. Halpern, K.B. ∙ Massalha, H. ∙ Zwick, R.K. ... Lgr5+ telocytes are a signaling source at the intestinal villus tip Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :1936 Google Scholar ). Re-analyzing the published scRNA-seq dataset from scleroderma patients ( Tabib et al., 2021 48. Tabib, T. ∙ Huang, M. ∙ Morse, N. ... Myofibroblast transcriptome indicates SFRP2 hi fibroblast progenitors in systemic sclerosis skin Nat. Commun. 2021; 12 :4384 Google Scholar ) revealed the same ScAF subset although in lower abundance. In the sclerodermatous skin, we found global and significant perturbations in ScAFs, reflected by alterations in their numbers, morphology, interactions with other cells, and their massive transcriptional and regulatory reprogramming of genes related to SSc fibrotic and vascular aberrations. Examining the skin of dSSc patients with short disease duration highlighted the importance of ScAF perturbation in the early disease stage. We found not only a shared gene module in ScAFs from the skin of limited and diffuse SSc patients compared with healthy controls but also a large number of unique molecular features representing each group of SSc patients. These findings support a model of SSc pathogenesis that involves two steps of reprogramming of the healthy skin ScAF from the critical skin homeostatic hubs to key pathogenic cells in SSc ( Figure 7 ). The major differences between the limited (step 1) and the diffuse ScAF (step 2) cells are additional perturbations in the dSSc ScAF ECM deposition pathways in parallel with inhibition of ECM breakdown, activation of angiogenesis, and activation of profibrotic signaling pathways such as JAK-STAT and IGF-1 ( Figure 7 ). Additionally, senescence hallmark genes were upregulated mainly in lSSc and early dSSc ScAF. The upregulation of antioxidant markers in ScAF of lSSc and their downregulation in dSSc compared with controls, in addition to significant downregulation of HLA-E and aberrant CD55 expression on dSSc ScAF, may also contribute to the extensive tissue damage found in the diffuse form.
Multiome analysis of skin stromal cells revealed the involvement of epigenetic and TF circuits, highlighting a potential role for the AP-1 family members in regulating the transition from healthy to pathological ScAFs ( Figure 7 ). We are approaching an exciting era of large single-cell genomic cohorts of hundreds of patients, combining deep single-cell molecular profiles with diverse phenotypic clinical metadata. Our SSc cohort is currently the largest published single-cell dataset connecting patient cellular, molecular, and epigenetic profiles with their clinical metadata. It enabled us to discover unique associations between diverse genes, pathways, and particular disease complications, which may serve as potential biomarkers for predicting disease trajectories in patients. Our detailed molecular characterization of ScAFs may also provide a foundation for the development of the next generation of drugs that leverage the unique signaling repertoire of these cells to restore their homeostatic phenotype (LGR5 dependence on R-spondin; Lin et al., 2017 36. Lin, Y. ∙ Fang, Z.P. ∙ Liu, H.J. ... HGF/R-spondin1 rescues liver dysfunction through the induction of Lgr5+ liver stem cells Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :1175 Google Scholar ) or block specific checkpoints. These strategies can open new horizons in the field of fibrotic diseases in general and in SSc in particular.
To translate our finding to a mechanistic model of fibrosis and therapy intervention, it is of importance to design more relevant animal and human ex vivo models of SSc that will allow exploration of the initial insult leading to SSc and specifically to the perturbation of ScAFs and other stromal and immune cells. Additional research is needed to determine the role of LGR5 gain- or loss-of-function on ScAF physiology. Finally, given the huge heterogeneity in SSc, a larger cohort of SSc patients and longitudinal follow-up will enable further definition of additional immune subtypes with roles in disease manifestations and progression and additional molecular-clinical correlations and biomarkers.

Patients who were diagnosed with SSc based on the 2013 American College of Rheumatology/European League against Rheumatism revised criteria for SSc ( Van Den Hoogen et al., 2013 52. Van Den Hoogen, F. ∙ Khanna, D. ∙ Fransen, J. ... 2013 classification criteria for systemic sclerosis: an American College of Rheumatology/European league against rheumatism collaborative initiative Ann. Rheum. Dis. 2013; 72 :1747-1755 Google Scholar ), were recruited to the study from rheumatology departments in two medical centers in Israel.
The group of SSc patients in our cohort consisted of 80 female (82.5%). Disease subtype and internal organ involvement were assessed according to established criteria; 44 patients (45.4%) have limited cutaneous SSc (lSSc), and 53 (54.6%) have diffuse cutaneous SSc (dSSc). The mean disease duration from the first non-Raynaud's phenomenon scleroderma symptom is 7.9 years in the dSSc group (+/- 7.36 years, disease duration between 5 month to 26 years), and 10.2 (+/-8.02 years, disease duration between 3 month to 33 years) in the lSSc group. Early disease defined as disease duration of ≤3 years (n=28), 11 dSSc patients were within 1 year of first non-Raynaud’s disease manifestation. In the dSSc patients 26 patients (49%) had high skin score (≥20) in the time of skin biopsy as measured by modified Rodnan Skin Score (mRSS). Active disease in our study refers to patients with high skin scores, and/or early in their disease process. Assessment of disease severity was done according to Medsger severity score ( Medsger et al., 2003 39. Medsger, T.A., Jr ∙ Bombardieri, S. ∙ Czirjak, L. ... Assessment of disease severity and prognosis Clin Exp Rheumatol. 2003; 21 :S42-S46 PMID: 12889222 Google Scholar ). Several of the patients were taking disease-modifying medications (DMARDs) as indicated in Table S1 . SSc patients under biological Disease-Modifying antirheumatic Drugs (bDMARDs) were excluded. After informed consent (in accordance with Helsinki declaration), skin samples were obtained through punch biopsy (4 mm), 10 cm distal to the elbow and placed in saline containing tubes on ice and then transferred to cold FACS buffer (EDTA pH8.0, 2mM, BSA 0.5% in PBS). Whole blood samples were collected at the time of skin biopsy, were placed in EDTA-containing tubes (Beckton Dickenson) on ice and diluted 1:1 with ice cold FACS buffer. Skin and blood samples immediately transported to the lab. As a control, we also collected blood and skin samples from healthy patients following the same procedure.
In order to generate gentle and efficient single-cell suspensions from human skin tissue, we used Miltenyi human whole skin dissociation kit (catalog num. 130-101-540), which combines mechanical dissociation with enzymatic degradation of the extracellular adhesion proteins. In short, first we cut the skin biopsy into small pieces (< 1mm) and transferred them into gentleMACS C Tube containing 435μL of Buffer and 65 μL of enzyme mix. Next, samples were incubated in a water bath at 37 °C for 1h. After incubation we diluted the samples by adding 0.5 mL of cold cell culture medium, tightly closed C Tube and attached it upside down onto the sleeve of the gentleMACS dissociator, and run the gentleMACS Program h_skin_01. After a short centrifugation step to collect the sample material at the tube bottom, we applied the cell suspension to a 70 μm pre-separation filter, placed on a 15 mL tube, and washed with ice cold FACS buffer. Then, we centrifuged the cell suspension at 300×g for 10 minutes at 4°C and aspirated the supernatant completely. Finally, after red blood cell lysis (Sigma) for 5min at 4°C, centrifugation at 300×g for 10 minutes at 4°C, and washing, we resuspended the cells for FACS staining and sorting.
Blood mononuclear cell separation was performed by density centrifugation media (Ficol-paque, GE Life Sciences) in a 1:1 ratio with blood cells. Centrifugation (460g, 25min) was performed at 10°C, and the mononuclear cells were carefully aspirated and washed with ice cold FACS buffer. After red blood cell lysis (Sigma) for 5 minutes at 4°C, centrifugation at 300×g for 10 minutes at 4°C, and washing, we resuspended the cells for FACS staining and sorting.
Skin cell suspension and blood mononuclear cells were stained with the following antibodies: CD45 (PerCp/Cyanine 5.5, 304028, Biolegend), CD90 (PE 328144, Biolegend), LGR5 (PE, 373803, Biolegend), CD55 (FITC, 311306, Biolegend). All FACS antibodies were used with a 1:100 dilution. Samples were filtered through a 40μm strainer before commencing sorting. Single cell sorting was performed using FACSAria Fusion cell sorter, and FACS Symphony S6, cell sorter (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). After doublets exclusion, isolated live cells were single-cell sorted into 384-well cell capture plates containing 2μL of lysis solution and barcoded poly(T) reverse-transcription (RT) primers for single-cell RNA-seq. Four empty wells were kept in each 384-well plate as a no-cell control for data analysis. Immediately after sorting, each plate was spun down to ensure cell immersion into the lysis solution, snap frozen on dry ice, and stored at –80°C until processed. Cells were analyzed using BD FACSDiva software (BD Bioscience) and FlowJo software (FlowJo, LLC).
Single-cell libraries were prepared as previously described ( Jaitin et al., 2014 24. Jaitin, D.A. ∙ Kenigsberg, E. ∙ Keren-Shaul, H. ... Massively parallel single-cell RNA-seq for marker-free decomposition of tissues into cell types Science. 2014; 343 :776-779 Google Scholar ; Keren-Shaul et al., 2019 30. Keren-Shaul, H. ∙ Kenigsberg, E. ∙ Jaitin, D.A. ... MARS-seq2.0: an experimental and analytical pipeline for indexed sorting combined with single-cell RNA sequencing Nat. Protoc. 2019; 14 :1841-1862 Google Scholar ). Briefly, mRNA from cells sorted into barcoded cell capture plates and converted into cDNA, later pooled by using an automated pipeline. The pooled sample is then linearly amplified by T7 in vitro transcription, and the resulting RNA is fragmented and converted into a sequencing-ready library by tagging the samples with pool barcodes and Illumina adapters during ligation, RT, and PCR. Each pool of cells was tested for library quality and concentration was assessed as described earlier ( Jaitin et al., 2014 24. Jaitin, D.A. ∙ Kenigsberg, E. ∙ Keren-Shaul, H. ... Massively parallel single-cell RNA-seq for marker-free decomposition of tissues into cell types Science. 2014; 343 :776-779 Google Scholar ; Keren-Shaul et al., 2019 30. Keren-Shaul, H. ∙ Kenigsberg, E. ∙ Jaitin, D.A. ... MARS-seq2.0: an experimental and analytical pipeline for indexed sorting combined with single-cell RNA sequencing Nat. Protoc. 2019; 14 :1841-1862 Google Scholar ). Overall, barcoding was done in three levels: Cell barcodes allow attribution of each sequence read to its cell of origin, thus enabling pooling; Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMIs) allow tagging each original molecule in order to avoid amplification bias; and plate barcodes allow elimination of the batch effect.
Cells were bulk sorted on FACS Symphony S6, cell sorter (BD Biosciences) using 100 nozzle and flow rate of 2 for 3 hours and pooled together. 75.000 and 40000 cells were obtained equally from 9 healthy and 9 dSSc patients, respectively, and processed according to 10x Genomics Chromium Single Cell Multiome ATAC+ Gene Expression low cell number protocol according to protocol number CG000365_DemonstratedProtocol_NucleiIsolation_ATAC_GEX_Sequencing_RevB used for cell lysis (0.1x lysis buffer and lysed for 6.5 min) to obtain intact nuclei. Single cell ATAC and RNA-seq libraries were prepared using the Chromium single cell multiome ATAC + gene expression platform (10x Genomics). Nuclei were prepared and counted to ensure quality and concentration. Nuclei were then transposed according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Transposed nuclei suspension was loaded onto Next GEM Chip J targeting 5000 nuclei and then ran on a Chromium Controller instrument to generate GEM emulsion (10x Genomics). Single-cell gene expression libraries, as well as single cell ATAC-seq libraries, were generated according to the manufacturer’s protocol using the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell multiome ATAC+ gene expression kit. Final libraries were quantified using NEBNext Library Quant Kit for Illumina (NEB) and high sensitivity D1000 TapeStation (Agilent). Each library was sequenced separately on a NovaSeq 6000 instrument using an SP 100 cycles reagent kit (Illumina), targeting 25,000 reads/nuclei for ATAC-seq and a minimum of 20,000 reads/nuclei for gene expression.
Single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) was used to reveal mRNA expression levels in the intact tissue, enabling the zonation patterns of landmark genes ( LM ) to be measured with a high spatial resolution. Probe libraries were designed using the Stellaris FISH Probe Designer Software (Biosearch Technologies, Inc., Petaluma, CA). SmFISH probes were coupled to Cy5, TMR or Alexa594 fluorescent dyes. First, skin biopsies (4mm of skin punch extends through to the subcutaneous fat) were taken into cold 4% PFA and incubated for 3 hours at 4°C. Then, samples were moved to 30% sucrose solution in cold 4% PFA over-night at 4°C. Samples were then rinsed in PBS and embedded in cryo-molds with Optimal Cutting Temperature (OCT) before freezing. 40-60 μm (for 3D imaging, LGR5 staining) or 10 μm (for 2D imaging, p16 staining) thick sections of fixed skin were cryosection onto poly L-lysine coated coverslips or cell imaging dish (35mm, 170μm, TCT, Eppendorf, 0030740017), respectively, and used for smFISH staining. Next, 40-60 μm\10 μm sections were fixed with cold 4% PFA for 30 minutes\10 minutes, respectively, and underwent gentler fixation and permeabilization with ETOH 70% for a minimum 2h at 4°C. Then, the skin sections were hybridized with smFISH probe sets (LGR5 conjugated to Cy5, Col1A1-conjugated to alexa594), according to a previously published protocol with some modifications ( Halpern et al., 2020 21. Halpern, K.B. ∙ Massalha, H. ∙ Zwick, R.K. ... Lgr5+ telocytes are a signaling source at the intestinal villus tip Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :1936 Google Scholar ). Briefly, tissues were treated for 10 minutes with proteinase K (10 μg/ml Ambion, AM2546) and washed twice with 2×SSC (Ambion, AM9765). Immuno-stained tissues were further permeabilized with either triton 0.5% (for CD55/phalloidin protein staining) or tween 0.2% (for p16 protein staining). Following two washes with 2×SSC, tissues were incubated in wash buffer (20% Formamide Ambion AM9342, 2×SSC) for 90 minutes and mounted with the hybridization buffer (10% Dextran sulfate Sigma D8906, 20% Formamide, 1 mg/ml E. coli tRNA Sigma R1753, 2×SSC, 0.02% BSA Ambion AM2616, 2 mM Vanadyl-ribonucleoside complex NEB S1402S) mixed with the probes. Hybridization mix was incubated with tissues for overnight in a 30°C incubator. After the hybridization, tissues were washed with wash buffer twice at 30 °C. For protein staining, coverslip or cell imaging dishes were incubated with CD55 (1:100)/ p16 (1:50) primary antibody that was added to GLOX buffer (0.4% glucose, 10 mM Tris buffer PH=8, 2×SSC). For immunofluorescence staining, unlabeled mouse anti human CD55-UNBL (9661-01, SouthernBiotech, 1:100), or mouse Anti human p16 (F12) (sc-1661, Santa-crus Biotechnology, 1:50) were used as primary antibodies following the post-hybridization washes. Staining for CD55 was followed by CY2 anti-mouse (715-225-151, Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs, 1:100) secondary antibody whereas as secondary antibody for p16 staining, we used biotinylated donkey anti-mouse (715-065-151, Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs, 1:100), followed by streptavidin Cy2 (016-220-084, Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs, 1:100). We further used Alexa Fluor™ 488 conjugated phalloidin (A12379, Invitrogen, 1:500) for immunofluorescence staining of F-actin. When we combined phalloidin with CD55 staining, the secondary Ab for CD55 was CY3 anti-mouse (CN-715-165-151, Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs 1:100,). Lastly, samples were counterstained with 50 ng/ml DAPI (D9542, Sigma-Aldrich) in GLOX buffer.
Imaging of skin punch biopsies of 40-60 μm slices was performed using a Andor Dragonfly Spinning disc confocal imaging system (Andor Technology PLC) connected to a Leica DMi8 microscope (Inverted) (Leica GMBH). Imaging was performed with a 40m pinhole disk. Slide overview was performed with a 20X/0.75 air objective tiles with 10% overlap and then stitched together. Following imaging conditions were used. Channels: DAPI staining excitation 405nm, emission 450/50nm, exposure 100ms; CD55 staining excitation 488nm, emission 495/20nm, exposure 200ms; COL1A1 mRNA staining excitation 561nm, emission 620/60nm, exposure 200ms; LGR5 mRNA staining excitation 637nm, emission 700/75nm, exposure 200ms. Laser power for all lasers was set for 20%. Signal was detected by an sCMOS Zyla (Andor) 2048×2048 camera in 16-bit depth, lens 20X/0.75 air imaging 665μ × 665μ pixel size 0.324μ. High magnification of specific loci were imaged using the same conditions with a 63 × 1.3 Glycerol objective 211μ × 211μ (XY) pixel size 0.103μ. Images were deconvolved with the internal Andor Fusion deconvolution application.
MARS-seq libraries, pooled at equimolar concentrations, were sequenced using an Illumina NextSeq 500 or NovaSeq 6000 sequencer, at a sequencing depth of 20K-50K reads per cell as previously described ( Jaitin et al., 2014 24. Jaitin, D.A. ∙ Kenigsberg, E. ∙ Keren-Shaul, H. ... Massively parallel single-cell RNA-seq for marker-free decomposition of tissues into cell types Science. 2014; 343 :776-779 Google Scholar ; Keren-Shaul et al., 2019 30. Keren-Shaul, H. ∙ Kenigsberg, E. ∙ Jaitin, D.A. ... MARS-seq2.0: an experimental and analytical pipeline for indexed sorting combined with single-cell RNA sequencing Nat. Protoc. 2019; 14 :1841-1862 Google Scholar ). Reads are condensed into original molecules by counting same unique molecular identifiers (UMI). We used statistics on empty-well spurious UMI detection to ensure that the batches we used for analysis showed a low level of cross single-cell contamination (less than 3%). MARS-seq reads were processed as previously described ( Jaitin et al., 2014 24. Jaitin, D.A. ∙ Kenigsberg, E. ∙ Keren-Shaul, H. ... Massively parallel single-cell RNA-seq for marker-free decomposition of tissues into cell types Science. 2014; 343 :776-779 Google Scholar ; Keren-Shaul et al., 2019 30. Keren-Shaul, H. ∙ Kenigsberg, E. ∙ Jaitin, D.A. ... MARS-seq2.0: an experimental and analytical pipeline for indexed sorting combined with single-cell RNA sequencing Nat. Protoc. 2019; 14 :1841-1862 Google Scholar ). Reads were mapped to human reference genome hg38 using HISAT (version 0.1.6); reads with multiple mapping positions were excluded. Reads were associated with genes if they were mapped to an exon, using the UCSC genome browser for reference. Exons of different genes that shared genomic position on the same strand were considered a single gene with a concatenated gene symbol.
To analyze the MARS-seq data from all the samples, we used the MetaCell package ( Baran et al., 2019 3. Baran, Y. ∙ Bercovich, A. ∙ Sebe-Pedros, A. ... MetaCell: analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data using K-nn graph partitions Genome Biol. 2019; 20 :206 Google Scholar ) as previously described ( Jaitin et al., 2014 24. Jaitin, D.A. ∙ Kenigsberg, E. ∙ Keren-Shaul, H. ... Massively parallel single-cell RNA-seq for marker-free decomposition of tissues into cell types Science. 2014; 343 :776-779 Google Scholar ; Keren-Shaul et al., 2019 30. Keren-Shaul, H. ∙ Kenigsberg, E. ∙ Jaitin, D.A. ... MARS-seq2.0: an experimental and analytical pipeline for indexed sorting combined with single-cell RNA sequencing Nat. Protoc. 2019; 14 :1841-1862 Google Scholar ; Li et al., 2019 35. Li, H. ∙ van der Leun, A.M. ∙ Yofe, I. ... Dysfunctional CD8 T cells form a proliferative, dynamically regulated compartment within human melanoma Cell. 2019; 176 :775-789.e18 Google Scholar ; Cohen et al., 2021 14. Cohen, Y.C. ∙ Zada, M. ∙ Wang, S.Y. ... Identification of resistance pathways and therapeutic targets in relapsed multiple myeloma patients through single-cell sequencing Nat. Med. 2021; 27 :491-503 Google Scholar ). Gene features with high variance to mean were selected using the variation-to-mean parameter T vm > 0.08 and minimal total UMI > 100. From the gene features, we excluded high abundance lincRNA and genes linked with poorly supported transcriptional models (such as genes annotated with the prefix "AC [0-9]", "AL [0-9]", etc.). Annotation of the metacell model was done using the metacell confusion matrix and analysis of marker genes. Finally, in the initial clustering, we identified immune cells, stromal cells, and doublets contamination. We next removed doublets contamination and performed second round clustering on immune cells and stromal cells separately. We identified immune or stromal cells using straightforward analysis of known cell type markers (e.g., COL1A2 – fibroblast cells, TRAC – T cells, C1QA - macrophages, S100A8 - monocytes, and more), and cross-validation with the existing data from previous works. In the final clustering, the gene feature selection strategy described above retained a total of 2,202 genes from immune cells and 2,026 genes from stromal cells for the computation of the Metacell balanced similarity graph. We used K = 500 bootstrap iterations. Metacell splitting was performed by clustering the cells within each metacell and splitting it if distinct clusters are detected. We examined batch effect by comparing the multiple plates from the same sample processed in the same batch or across different batches and cells from the same population but different healthy subjects, and confirmed our method displayed no clear batch effect and our analysis is robust.
The 2D projection is computed using a force-directed layout algorithm on a balanced similarity graph. First, a raw similarity matrix is generated by computing Pearson’s correlations on the transformed UMI counts of features (genes). Next, the raw similarity matrix is used to generate a weighted adjacency matrix for a weighted, directed cell graph G, in which a heavy edge from cell i to cell j indicates strong attraction of the former to the latter. Then, the balanced similarity graph G is partitioned into metacell graph G M using an adaptation of k-means to graphs with bootstrapping. Finally, the coordinates for each metacell in the 2D projection are computed by applying a standard force-directed layout algorithm to the metacell graph G M , and the cells are positioned by averaging the metacell coordinates of their filtered neighbor cells in the original balanced graph G.
In order to provide robust estimates of gene expression between fibroblast metacells, we calculated a z-score for each gene of each fibroblast metacell according to the following steps. First, for a given fibroblast metacell, we randomly selected 100 cells from the metacell and 100 cells from all fibroblast cells. Second, we computed a p-value using Mann-Whitney test for each gene comparing the normalized UMI counts in the 100 cells from the metacell and the 100 cells from all fibroblast cells. This p-value then was converted into a z-score. For each fibroblast metacell, we performed the previous two steps 100 times to obtain 100 z-scores for each gene, and we calculated the average value of the 100 z-scores to represent the relative expression of each gene in the given fibroblast metacell compared with the whole fibroblast population. We performed the same calculation for all the fibroblast metacells.
To calculate the normalized gene expression per metacell or per cell population, we first down-sampled total UMI counts of individual cells to the same level (n = 250 for immune cells and n = 400 for stromal cells). To account for the variable cell numbers, for each metacell or a population in each patient, we randomly sampled a fixed number of cells and calculated the average UMI counts for each gene. Lastly, we performed the previous step 100 times to estimate the means and distributions of gene expression in each metacell or cell population from a given subject, and finally use them as normalized gene expression.
We used the rich single cell gene expression information and performed differential gene expression analysis by comparing cells of the same subset from healthy control group and SSc patient groups. To account for the variable cell numbers between individual patients, the same number of cells were sampled from each patient for a given cell population. In order to obtain comparable results across different cell populations, we also controlled the total number of cells we sampled for a given population. A z-statistics was computed for each gene using Wilcoxon rank sum test on the down-sampled UMI counts from the cells of healthy control group and two SSc patient groups. Z-statistics Z mean for each gene was calculated by randomly repeating 100 times the sampling procedure. Z mean were converted into p values, and then we performed multiple testing correction on the p values with a standard Benjamini-Hochberg procedure and controlled for false discovery rate (FDR) q-value < 0.05.
Low-level read processing and alignment was performed with the Cell ranger ARC/2.0.0 tool. Data integration of RNA-seq data from 10x multiome with our MARS-seq reference atlas was done using label transfer. In short, we used a Knn-classifier (k=50) using the Pearson’s correlation as a similarity metric over the normalized gene features defined for the reference model. The distribution of cluster memberships over these k -neighbors was used to associate the new cell with a reference metacell (by majority voting) and to project the cell in two dimensions by weighted average of the linked reference clusters’ mapped x and y coordinates. We then performed WNN analysis with our 10x multiome data from healthy controls and dSSc patients using Seurat 4.0.6 and validated the label transfer from our MARS-seq reference atlas ( Hao et al., 2021 22. Hao, Y. ∙ Hao, S. ∙ Andersen-Nissen, E. ... Integrated analysis of multimodal single-cell data Cell. 2021; 184 :3573-3587.e29 Google Scholar ; Stuart et al., 2021 47. Stuart, T. ∙ Srivastava, A. ∙ Madad, S. ... Single-cell chromatin state analysis with Signac Nat. Methods. 2021; 18 :1333-1341 Google Scholar ). Specific parameters include min.dist = 0.5 for “RunMAP” and resolution = 1.2 for “FindClusters”. ChromVAR (1.16.0) was used for the analysis of motif accessibility on the merged 10 multiome ATAC-seq peaks from the ARC tools. Presto (1.0.0) was used to identify differential peaks and differential expressed genes. We defined differential ATAC-seq peaks with at least 5% cells with non-zero signals in at least one of the cell groups, FDR < 0.05, and logFC > 0.2. We used JASPAR2020 motif models for DNA motif scanning. We used gene models from EnsDb.Hsapiens.v86 and defined promoter regions as within 1Kb from transcription start site (TSS) distal chromatin regions as 50Kb away from TSS.
To visualize all skin interactions, we used a published dataset of ligand and receptor pairs ( Ramilowski et al., 2015 43. Ramilowski, J.A. ∙ Goldberg, T. ∙ Harshbarger, J. ... A draft network of ligand-receptor-mediated multicellular signalling in human Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 :7866 Google Scholar ). We applied a lenient filtering, including all LR with > 0.2 mean detected UMIs in at least one meta-cell (normalized to meta-cell size). We applied FDR-adjusted Mann-Whitney test to screen for ligands and receptors whose mean expression within ScAF or pericytes/vascular cells is significantly altered in dSSc or lSSc patients compared to healthy controls.
After excluding images containing hair follicles, z-stacks used to result in 113 z-stacks in total (35 stacks from 3 control donors, 41 from 4 lSSc patients, and 37 from 4 dSSc 4 patients). The first 30 slices of a z-stack were used for quantification. For the LGR5 mRNA channel, the 30 slices were maximum intensity projected by every three non-overlapping and adjacent slices, resulting in 10 merged slices. The DAPI channel was maximum intensity projected to one image. Maximum intensity projected images were fed into a pixel classification and object detection pipeline in Ilastik ( Berg et al., 2019 6. Berg, S. ∙ Kutra, D. ∙ Kroeger, T. ... ilastik: interactive machine learning for (bio)image analysis Nat. Methods. 2019; 16 :1226-1232 Google Scholar ) resulting in object classified images. The classification pipelines were trained for the LGR5 and DAPI channels separately. Multiple maximum intensity projected images from each patient group were used for manual training (DAPI: 3 control, 5 lSSc, 4 dSSc; LGR5 : 8 control, 5 lSSc, 7 dSSc) to identify the LGR5 signal spots and DAPI nuclei. Next, based on the object-classified images, the Euclidian distance between the centroids of LGR5 spots and DAPI nuclei were calculated. Each LGR5 spot was assigned to the closest nucleus. LGR5 spots located further than 80 μm from any nucleus were excluded. Image pre-processing was done with ImageJ. The calculation of Euclidian distances, the quantification and grouping of FISH signal was done with a custom Matlab script. Inferential statistics was done with R.
To test whether a specific disease manifestation is associated with specific molecular features, we performed linear regression with the lm function in R, using patients cell type abundances and gene expression profiles from the scRNA-seq data with their clinical features. For the cell type abundances, we removed immune cell populations that are detected in less than two patients in a given source, and we only considered fibroblasts, pericytes, and vascular endothelial cell populations in the linear regression analysis. For the gene expression, for each population, only the data from the patients with a fixed minimal number of cells (20 cells, we also tested with 15 cells and the results were similar) were used in the analysis. To account for the variable cell numbers between individual patients for the same population, normalized gene expression was used. We performed linear regression for every expressed gene in a given population or a pooled cell linage and performed multiple testing correction on the p values with a standard Benjamini-Hochberg procedure and controlled for false discovery rate (FDR) q-value < 0.05.
Statistical analysis Data was presented as mean (±SEM) of three independent experiments. Comparisons between two groups of samples were evaluated using the Mann–Whitney U test. All P-values reported were two tailed and statistical significance was defined as P less than 0.05. All statistical analyses were conducted using R software (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).
