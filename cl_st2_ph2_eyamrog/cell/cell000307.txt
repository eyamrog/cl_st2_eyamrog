Title: 3D Genome of macaque fetal brain reveals evolutionary innovations during primate corticogenesis


Abstract: Summary

Elucidating the regulatory mechanisms of human brain evolution is essential to understanding human cognition and mental disorders. We generated multi-omics profiles and constructed a high-resolution map of 3D genome architecture of rhesus macaque during corticogenesis. By comparing the 3D genomes of human, macaque, and mouse brains, we identified many human-specific chromatin structure changes, including 499 topologically associating domains (TADs) and 1,266 chromatin loops. The human-specific loops are significantly enriched in enhancer-enhancer interactions, and the regulated genes show human-specific expression changes in the subplate, a transient zone of the developing brain critical for neural circuit formation and plasticity. Notably, many human-specific sequence changes are located in the human-specific TAD boundaries and loop anchors, which may generate new transcription factor binding sites and chromatin structures in human. Collectively, the presented data highlight the value of comparative 3D genome analyses in dissecting the regulatory mechanisms of brain development and evolution.

Section: Introduction

The human brain exhibits unique organizing principles and developmental patterns when compared with nonhuman primates (NHPs) ( Sousa et al., 2017 88. Sousa, A.M.M. ∙ Meyer, K.A. ∙ Santpere, G. ... Evolution of the Human Nervous System Function, Structure, and Development Cell. 2017; 170 :226-247 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (106) PubMed Google Scholar ). It was proposed that the developing human brain has an expanded proliferative zone, the outer subventricular zone (OSVZ), and more diverse neural progenitor cell types that account for human brain size expansion ( Lui et al., 2011 57. Lui, J.H. ∙ Hansen, D.V. ∙ Kriegstein, A.R.

Neurobiol. 2016; 39 :122-132 Crossref Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, the maturation of neurons appears to be prolonged, and neural networks are more complex in hominids compared to NHPs ( Marchetto et al., 2019 60. Marchetto, M.C. ∙ Hrvoj-Mihic, B. ∙ Kerman, B.E. ...

Sherwood, C.C. ∙ Gómez-Robles, A. Brain Plasticity and Human Evolution Annu. Rev. Anthropol. 2017; 46 :399-419 Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar ). For example, our recent study showed that the transgenic monkeys carrying a human version of MCPH1 (a key brain developmental gene) had delayed neuron differentiation and maturation and improved short-term memory, mimicking the brain developmental neoteny of humans ( Shi et al., 2019 86. Shi, L. ∙ Luo, X. ∙ Jiang, J. ... Transgenic rhesus monkeys carrying the human MCPH1 gene copies show human-like neoteny of brain development Natl. Sci.

Res. 2019; 40 :236-238 Crossref Scopus (4) PubMed Google Scholar ). Additionally, the subplate neurons form one of the first functional cortical circuits during fetal brain development and may associate with the unique developmental patterns of human neural circuits ( Hoerder-Suabedissen and Molnár, 2015 33.

Neurosci. 2013; 7 :423 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ), although the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive.
Recent advances in comparative genomic analyses have provided increasing evidences that our evolution, since the human-chimpanzee divergence, has been driven mostly by gene regulation ( Bird et al., 2007 4.

Several studies revealed that long-range chromatin interactions might regulate human-specific brain gene expression and associate with aging-related diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease ( Chen et al., 2018 7.

Won, H. ∙ Huang, J. ∙ Opland, C.K. ... Human evolved regulatory elements modulate genes involved in cortical expansion and neurodevelopmental disease susceptibility Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :2396 Crossref Scopus (2) PubMed Google Scholar ). Hence, it is feasible to hypothesize that the human-specific changes of chromatin structure may lead to gene regulation alterations and eventually contribute to the unique human brain phenotypes. To test this hypothesis, we need to generate brain 3D genome data of NHPs at key developmental stages in order to identify the human-specific gene regulatory changes. In theory, as the closest relative of human, chimpanzee would be the ideal NHP species to study ( Waterson et al., 2005 97. Waterson, R.H. ∙ Lander, E.S. ∙ Wilson, R.K., Chimpanzee Sequencing and Analysis Consortium Initial sequence of the chimpanzee genome and comparison with the human genome Nature. 2005; 437 :69-87 Crossref Scopus (1553) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, it is extremely difficult to obtain chimpanzee fetal brain samples for 3D genome experiments. Alternatively, as the most widely used NHP species, macaque is phylogenetically close to human (∼7% sequence divergence), and it is relatively easy to obtain brain samples at different developmental stages, making it a suitable model for exploring human brain evolution at 3D genome level.
Here, we collected brain tissues of Chinese rhesus macaque ( Macaca mulatta ) at mid-gestation, and constructed a high-resolution 3D genome map, which provides valuable basis for further comparative 3D genomic analysis. Through multi-omics evolutionary analyses among human, rhesus macaque, and mouse, we identified many human-specific chromatin structure changes including topologically associating domains (TADs) and loops. We also studied the genomic features and functional enrichment of the human-specific TADs and loops to shed new light on the genetic basis of human brain development and evolution.

Section: Results

We sampled three macaque fetal brains at mid-gestation (E84), the time of neurogenesis peak during development. We dissected cerebral cortex into two major zones: (1) cortex plate (CP), consisting primarily of post-mitotic neurons, and (2) germinal zone (GZ), consisting primarily of neural progenitors ( Figure 1 A; STAR methods ). To reveal the regulatory landscape of the developing macaque cortex, we constructed high-resolution genome-wide chromatin interaction maps using Hi-C. We also mapped gene expression (RNA sequencing [RNA-seq]), DNase I hypersensitive sites (DNase-seq), and CTCF occupancy (CTCF chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing [ChIP-seq]). We validated the accuracy of zone dissection by checking the expression of the known marker genes for neural progenitors ( SOX2 , PAX6 , and FOXG1 ) and neurons ( FEZF2 , SYP , and NEUROD1 ) ( Figure 1 B).
Using Hi-C 2.0 ( Belaghzal et al., 2017 2. Belaghzal, H. ∙ Dekker, J. ∙ Gibcus, J.H. Hi-C 2.0: An optimized Hi-C procedure for high-resolution genome-wide mapping of chromosome conformation Methods. 2017; 123 :56-65 Crossref Scopus (90) PubMed Google Scholar ), we sequenced ∼8 billion paired-end reads and generated nearly 5 billion unique mapped contacts in total ( Table S1 ). The biological and technical replicates are highly correlated (Pearson’s correlation R ≥ 0.95) ( Figures S1 A and S1B), and we therefore merged the data by zone type for downstream analysis. We validated contact quality of the Hi-C data by cis / trans interaction ratio and distance-dependent interaction frequency decay ( Figure S1 C; Table S1 ). We reached an ultra-deep resolution of 1.5 kilobase pairs (kb) ( Table S1 ; STAR methods ), which enables us to explore macaque 3D genome structure at different scales, including compartments, TADs, and loops ( Figure 1 C).
Most of the A/B compartments are conserved between CP and GZ, and the ratio (3.6%–3.8%) of switched compartments is consistent with previous findings in human fetal brains (CP versus GZ: 3.78%) ( Won et al., 2016 99. Won, H. ∙ de la Torre-Ubieta, L. ∙ Stein, J.L. ... Chromosome conformation elucidates regulatory relationships in developing human brain Nature. 2016; 538 :523-527 Crossref Scopus (199) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S1 D). We identified a total of 1,977 and 2,265 TADs for CP and GZ, respectively, among which 64.4% are shared between them ( Figure S1 E), and the numbers of the identified TADs in macaque is similar to the reported numbers of TADs in the human fetal brain ( Won et al., 2016 99. Won, H. ∙ de la Torre-Ubieta, L. ∙ Stein, J.L. ... Chromosome conformation elucidates regulatory relationships in developing human brain Nature. 2016; 538 :523-527 Crossref Scopus (199) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because the resolution of the published human fetal brain Hi-C data was only 10 kb ( Won et al., 2016 99. Won, H. ∙ de la Torre-Ubieta, L. ∙ Stein, J.L. ... Chromosome conformation elucidates regulatory relationships in developing human brain Nature. 2016; 538 :523-527 Crossref Scopus (199) PubMed Google Scholar ), for cross-species comparison, we called loops in macaque with the same resolution using the HICCUPS pipeline ( Rao et al., 2014 77. Rao, S.S. ∙ Huntley, M.H. ∙ Durand, N.C. ... A 3D map of the human genome at kilobase resolution reveals principles of chromatin looping Cell. 2014; 159 :1665-1680 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2411) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( STAR methods ). In total, we identified 8,399 and 15,048 loops in CP and GZ, respectively ( Figure S1 F). The 3C experiments show that 86.6% (26/30) of the loops can be validated, suggesting our Hi-C results are reliable ( Figure S1 G; Table S2 ). There are 8,179 (54.4%) loops shared between CP and GZ ( Figure S1 F), and the smaller number of loops (∼44% reduction) in CP relative to GZ is consistent with the reported reduction (∼40% to 50% decrease) of loops in human neurons relative to neural progenitor cells ( Rajarajan et al., 2018 75. Rajarajan, P. ∙ Borrman, T. ∙ Liao, W. ... Neuron-specific signatures in the chromosomal connectome associated with schizophrenia risk Science. 2018; 362 :eaat4311 Crossref Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ). As expected, the zone-specific loops are associated with differential gene expression ( Figure S1 H). For example, we observed zone-specific chromatin interactions at SOX2 (highly expressed in GZ) and BHLHE22 (highly expressed in CP), respectively ( Figures 1 D and S1 I).
To show that the identified loops using our ultra-deep contact maps are informative in detecting regulatory events in the genome, as a proof of principle, we checked interactions between two putative enhancers and the promoter of FOXP2 ( Figure 1 E), a well-known gene that plays an important role in human speech and language development ( Lai et al., 2000 46. Lai, C.S. ∙ Fisher, S.E. ∙ Hurst, J.A. ... The SPCH1 region on human 7q31: genomic characterization of the critical interval and localization of translocations associated with speech and language disorder Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 67 :357-368 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (141) PubMed Google Scholar , 2001 47. Lai, C.S. ∙ Fisher, S.E. ∙ Hurst, J.A. ... A forkhead-domain gene is mutated in a severe speech and language disorder Nature. 2001; 413 :519-523 Crossref Scopus (1273) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lennon et al., 2007 52. Lennon, P.A. ∙ Cooper, M.L. ∙ Peiffer, D.A. ... Deletion of 7q31.1 supports involvement of FOXP2 in language impairment: clinical report and review Am. J. Med. Genet. A. 2007; 143A :791-798 Crossref Scopus (69) PubMed Google Scholar ). These two putative enhancers are also active in humans (hs218 and hs956) and can drive forebrain- and midbrain-specific expression in mouse embryos ( Visel et al., 2007 95. Visel, A. ∙ Minovitsky, S. ∙ Dubchak, I. ... VISTA Enhancer Browser--a database of tissue-specific human enhancers Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35 :D88-D92 Crossref Scopus (557) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S1 J). The loops between these two enhancers and the promoter of FOXP2 were successfully identified by the Hi-C data ( Figure 1 E).
To assess the penetrance of the detected loops around FOXP2 , we performed 3D-DNA FISH using the brain tissue sections of fetal monkeys ( STAR methods ), and the results are consistent with the Hi-C data that the loop regulating FOXP2 are present in both CP (69.0%, 49/71) and GZ (76.7%, 66/86) at similar frequency (Fisher’s exact test, p = 0.284) ( Figures 1 F, 1G, S1 K, and S1L; Table S2 ). We saw similar penetrance ratios for another GZ-CP shared loop involving the SOX2 gene (63.0%, 53/84 in CP and 57.1%, 48/84 in GZ) (Fisher’s exact test, p = 0.528) ( Figures S1 M and S1N). In contrast, although a GZ-biased loop from Hi-C has overall lower penetrance ratio compared to the GZ-CP shared loops, it has a higher penetrance ratio in GZ (11.4%, 9/79) than in CP (3.7%, 3/81) (Fisher’s exact test, p = 0.077) ( Figures S1 M, S1O, and S1P). These cases indicate that our Hi-C data can effectively capture regulatory events during corticogenesis.
We next performed cross-species Hi-C analyses at multiple scales, which allows us to characterize human-specific patterns in 3D genome organization.
TADs are fundamental regulatory chromatin structures and are largely conserved across tissues and species ( Dixon et al., 2012 15. Dixon, J.R. ∙ Selvaraj, S. ∙ Yue, F. ... Topological domains in mammalian genomes identified by analysis of chromatin interactions Nature. 2012; 485 :376-380 Crossref Scopus (3008) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rao et al., 2014 77. Rao, S.S. ∙ Huntley, M.H. ∙ Durand, N.C. ... A 3D map of the human genome at kilobase resolution reveals principles of chromatin looping Cell. 2014; 159 :1665-1680 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2411) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, how TAD changes during evolution influence gene regulation of brain development are not well defined. Here, we characterize the evolutionary dynamics of TADs by comparative brain Hi-C across human, macaque, and mouse (outgroup). The developmental stage (17–18 gestation weeks) of the published human Hi-C data ( Won et al., 2016 99. Won, H. ∙ de la Torre-Ubieta, L. ∙ Stein, J.L. ... Chromosome conformation elucidates regulatory relationships in developing human brain Nature. 2016; 538 :523-527 Crossref Scopus (199) PubMed Google Scholar ) is equivalent to that of rhesus macaque, and the mouse Hi-C data were from in vivo neural progenitors (corresponding to GZ) and neurons (corresponding to CP) ( Bonev et al., 2017 5. Bonev, B. ∙ Mendelson Cohen, N. ∙ Szabo, Q. ... Multiscale 3D Genome Rewiring during Mouse Neural Development Cell. 2017; 171 :557-572.e24 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (361) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We identified TADs and TAD boundaries using the directionality index (DI) and the insulation score methods ( Crane et al., 2015 10. Crane, E. ∙ Bian, Q. ∙ McCord, R.P. ... Condensin-driven remodelling of X chromosome topology during dosage compensation Nature. 2015; 523 :240-244 Crossref Scopus (292) PubMed Google Scholar ; Dixon et al., 2012 15. Dixon, J.R. ∙ Selvaraj, S. ∙ Yue, F. ... Topological domains in mammalian genomes identified by analysis of chromatin interactions Nature. 2012; 485 :376-380 Crossref Scopus (3008) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S2 A; STAR methods ). We compared the features of TADs among human, macaque, and mouse. The number and size of TADs among species are similar in both CP and GZ ( Figure S2 B). We define the shared TADs among the three species as the conserved TADs, and those only gained or lost in human as the human-specific TADs (hsTADs) ( STAR methods ). We found 499 hsTADs, including 410 human gained TADs (hgTADs) and 89 human lost TADs (hlTADs) ( Figure S2 C). The medium size of hgTADs is 640 kb, smaller than the conserved TADs (900 kb) ( Figure S2 C), consistent with the published data showing a large size of the conserved TADs by comparing human, gibbon, and other mammalian species ( Lazar et al., 2018 51. Lazar, N.H. ∙ Nevonen, K.A. ∙ O’Connell, B. ... Epigenetic maintenance of topological domains in the highly rearranged gibbon genome Genome Res. 2018; 28 :983-997 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ). It was reported that the transcriptionally active domains in Drosophila tend to have smaller size than the inactive domains ( Sexton et al., 2012 83. Sexton, T. ∙ Yaffe, E. ∙ Kenigsberg, E. ... Three-dimensional folding and functional organization principles of the Drosophila genome Cell. 2012; 148 :458-472 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1046) PubMed Google Scholar ). Hence, hgTADs are likely active regulatory domains. By contrast, hlTADs occur less frequently than hgTADs in the human genome, likely due to a strong functional constraint on loosing previously functional TADs during evolution, and their size (1,320 kb) is larger than the conserved TADs ( Figure S2 C). We saw similar species-specific TAD size patterns in macaque and mouse ( Figure S2 C).
We then compared the TAD boundaries among species ( STAR methods ). The results show that ∼55% (n = 1,513) of the TADs boundaries are conserved across species, and ∼14% (n = 385) of the TAD boundaries are the hgTAD boundaries ( Figures 2 A and 2B; Table S3 ).
We further explored the features of the conserved and the hgTAD boundaries. The conserved TAD boundaries have stronger insulation than the hgTAD boundaries ( Figures 2 C and S2 D). Although most of the conserved and the hgTADs boundaries are enriched with CTCF binding, the enrichment levels are lower for the hgTAD boundaries (63%) than the conserved TAD boundaries (77%), indicating that the hgTAD boundaries are less CTCF dependent than the conserved TAD boundaries ( Figure 2 D). We also found the hgTAD boundaries showed weaker CTCF ChIP-seq signals than the conserved boundaries in neural cells ( Song et al., 2019 87. Song, M. ∙ Yang, X. ∙ Ren, X. ... Mapping cis-regulatory chromatin contacts in neural cells links neuropsychiatric disorder risk variants to target genes Nat. Genet. 2019; 51 :1252-1262 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S2 E). We finally examined the tissue and cell type conservation ratios ( Schmitt et al., 2016 81. Schmitt, A.D. ∙ Hu, M. ∙ Jung, I. ... A Compendium of Chromatin Contact Maps Reveals Spatially Active Regions in the Human Genome Cell Rep. 2016; 17 :2042-2059 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (272) PubMed Google Scholar ) and found that the conserved TAD boundaries had higher conservation ratio across tissues and cell types, while the hgTAD boundaries were more tissue and cell-type-specific ( Figures 2 E and S2 F). Collectively, through cross-species comparison, we were able to identify human-specific TADs, especially the hgTADs, which showed distinct features in view of size, CTCF binding strength, and tissue/cell specificity, an implication functional specialization of these newly evolved TADs during human brain evolution.
Previously, it was reported that the mammalian interspersed repeats (MIRs), a conserved family of transposable elements (TEs), can serve as insulators within TAD boundaries in a CTCF-independent manner ( Wang et al., 2015 96. Wang, J. ∙ Vicente-García, C. ∙ Seruggia, D. ... MIR retrotransposon sequences provide insulators to the human genome Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112 :E4428-E4437 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). We performed an enrichment analysis for TEs in the human genome and compared the patterns between the hgTAD boundaries and the conserved TAD boundaries. We found the conserved TAD boundaries were enriched for evolutionarily old TEs, including MIR, LINE-2 (L2), Charlie, and MaLR ( Figure S2 G). By contrast, the hgTAD boundaries are enriched in evolutionarily young TEs, and four TE families are slightly enriched, including Alu, LINE-1 (L1), human endogenous retrovirus subfamily 1, and K (ERV1 and ERVK) ( Figures 2 F and S2 G). In particular, compared to the conserved boundaries, the hgTAD boundaries are significantly enriched in AluY, the youngest Alu elements in primates ( Kapitonov and Jurka, 1996 38. Kapitonov, V. ∙ Jurka, J. The age of Alu subfamilies J. Mol. Evol. 1996; 42 :59-65 Crossref Scopus (239) PubMed Google Scholar ), while no significant enrichment was detected in the relatively old Alu elements (AluJ and AluS) ( Figure 2 G), implying that the young Alu elements might be actively involved in forming the human-specific contact patterns ( Cournac et al., 2016 9. Cournac, A. ∙ Koszul, R. ∙ Mozziconacci, J. The 3D folding of metazoan genomes correlates with the association of similar repetitive elements Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44 :245-255 Crossref Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ). Similarly, in the L1 subfamilies, the evolutionarily young L1PA is significantly enriched for the hgTAD boundaries, but not the relatively old L1PB ( Figure S2 H).
We then examined the genes associated with the conserved and the hgTAD boundaries ( STAR methods ). We found that genes associated with the hgTAD boundaries showed marginally significant expression difference across species compared with the conserved TAD boundaries (Fisher’s exact test, p = 0.06) ( Figure S2 I). The conserved TAD boundaries were more enriched in housekeeping genes, while the hgTAD boundaries were more enriched in brain-development-related genes ( Figures S2 J and S2K; Table S3 ). One example is the hgTAD boundary around CNTN5 , a gene involved in neuron circuit formation and autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) ( Ashrafi et al., 2014 1. Ashrafi, S. ∙ Betley, J.N. ∙ Comer, J.D. ...

Social Responsiveness Scale-aided analysis of the clinical impact of copy number variations in autism Neurogenetics. 2011; 12 :315-323 Crossref Scopus (59) PubMed Google Scholar ). This hgTAD boundary contains Alu Y elements and is correlated with an increased CNTN5 expression in human than in macaque ( Figure 2 H).
Collectively, we observed a significant enrichment of TEs, especially the evolutionarily young TEs (AluY and L1PA) at the hgTADs boundaries, which may contribute to the origin of the human-specific TADs in brain during evolution.
Compared to TADs, chromatin loops are more dynamic across developmental stages and may affect gene expression ( Bonev et al., 2017 5. Bonev, B. ∙ Mendelson Cohen, N. ∙ Szabo, Q. ... Multiscale 3D Genome Rewiring during Mouse Neural Development Cell. 2017; 171 :557-572.e24 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (361) PubMed Google Scholar ). We identified loops in the three species at 10 kb resolution using the HICCUPS pipeline ( Rao et al., 2014 77. Rao, S.S. ∙ Huntley, M.H. ∙ Durand, N.C. ... A 3D map of the human genome at kilobase resolution reveals principles of chromatin looping Cell. 2014; 159 :1665-1680 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2411) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S3 A; STAR methods ). Aggregating peak analysis (APA) demonstrated the accuracy of loop calling ( Figure S3 B). This was further supported by the epigenetic features of loops ( Figure S3 C).
Next, we compared loops across species using the merged CP and GZ loop profiles so that the species-specific rather than the zone-specific changes can be detected. In total, we identified 1,904 conserved loops (ConsLs) among the three species and 1,266 human-specific loops (HSLs) ( Figures 3 A and 3B; Table S4 ), and these loops were validated by APA ( Figures 3 A and S3 D). In general, the lengths of HSLs and the macaque-specific loops are significantly smaller than that of ConsLs (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, p < 2.2 × 10 −16 ), while the pattern is opposite in mouse ( Figure S3 E). Similar to the result of the TAD boundaries, the species-specific loop anchors are less enriched in CTCF ChIP-seq signals than the ConsL anchors ( Figure S3 F).
To explore the function of the different loop categories, we integrated them with human fetal brain H3K4me1 signals (Kundaje et al., 2015) which reflect enhancer potentials. Remarkably, HSLs are significantly enriched for enhancers compared to ConsLs (Fisher’s exact test, p < 2.2 × 10 −16 ), while no such enrichment is detected for promoters ( Figures 3 C and 3D). Almost 80% of the HSL anchors contain at least one enhancer, compared to less than 60% for the ConsL anchors ( Figure 3 D). In terms of loop types, the enhancer-promoter interactions account for only ∼27% of HSLs, and nearly 40% of HSLs are enhancer-enhancer interactions, which is a significant enrichment compared to ConsLs (Fisher’s exact test, p < 2.2 × 10 −16 ) ( Figure 3 E). The enrichment of enhancer-enhancer interactions is not seen in the macaque/mouse specific loops ( Figures S3 G and S3H).
Enhancer-enhancer interactions are implicated in gene control by forming enhancer cliques or spatially interaction hubs to regulate gene expression ( Mumbach et al., 2017 63. Mumbach, M.R. ∙ Satpathy, A.T. ∙ Boyle, E.A. ... Enhancer connectome in primary human cells identifies target genes of disease-associated DNA elements Nat.

Oncogenic Notch Promotes Long-Range Regulatory Interactions within Hyperconnected 3D Cliques Mol. Cell. 2019; 73 :1174-1190.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sanborn et al., 2015 79. Sanborn, A.L. ∙ Rao, S.S. ∙ Huang, S.C. ... Chromatin extrusion explains key features of loop and domain formation in wild-type and engineered genomes Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112 :E6456-E6465 Crossref Scopus (653) PubMed Google Scholar ). To identify target genes regulated by enhancer-enhancer interactions, we generated an undirected graph using the Hi-C loops and detected communities using the fast greedy algorithm ( Phanstiel et al., 2017 71. Phanstiel, D.H. ∙ Van Bortle, K. ∙ Spacek, D. ... Static and Dynamic DNA Loops form AP-1-Bound Activation Hubs during Macrophage Development Mol. Cell. 2017; 67 :1037-1048.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (85) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( STAR methods ). In many communities, multiple enhancers regulate one or several promoters ( Figure 3 F). Genes in the same communities have higher co-expression correlation than those in different communities both in CP and GZ ( Figure 3 G), suggesting that the detected communities may represent co-regulation units.
One remarkable case showing the regulatory feature of the human-specific interactions involves the AUTS2 (autism susceptibility candidate 2) gene. Strikingly, there is a complex interaction hub regulating AUTS2 in the human fetal brain. The hub contains 14 enhancers and more than half of the loops in the hub are human-specific ( Figures 3 H, 3I, and S3 I). Two human enhancers (hs1425 and hs658) showed midbrain and neural-tube-specific expression in mouse embryos ( Visel et al., 2007 95. Visel, A. ∙ Minovitsky, S. ∙ Dubchak, I. ... VISTA Enhancer Browser--a database of tissue-specific human enhancers Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35 :D88-D92 Crossref Scopus (557) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S3 J). By contrast, there is only one loop detected in macaque and three in mouse within the orthologous region ( Figures 3 I and S3 I). Consistently, in the CP zone, the expression of AUTS2 is significantly higher in human than in macaque ( Figure S3 K). In addition, compared with macaque, human has more CTCF-binding sites in this region, some of which are close to the HSL anchors ( Figure 3 I). The difference in CTCF-binding sites may be responsible for the chromatin structure and gene expression difference between human and macaque brains.
We defined 1,411 and 1,079 target genes for ConsLs and HSLs, respectively, by combining target genes of direct promoter-enhancer or promoter-promoter loops and target genes of enhancer-enhancer loops through contact communities ( Table S4 ; STAR methods ). We found that the HSL target genes tend to be more upregulated in human compared to macaque than the ConsL target genes and the target genes of the macaque-specific loops ( Figures S4 A and S4B), an indication of gene regulatory changes associated with HSLs.
Gene regulation usually works in a tissue and cell-type-specific manner. We analyzed enrichment of target genes in different laminae using the microarray data from the laser-micro-dissected human fetal brain ( Miller et al., 2014 62. Miller, J.A. ∙ Ding, S.L. ∙ Sunkin, S.M. ... Transcriptional landscape of the prenatal human brain Nature. 2014; 508 :199-206 Crossref Scopus (550) PubMed Google Scholar ). Surprisingly, the HSL target genes are significantly enriched in inner cortical plate (CPi) and subplate (SP) compared to the ConsL target genes ( Figure 4 A). For example, NR4A2 and TMEM178A , the two SP preferentially expressed genes, are regulated by HSLs ( Table S4 ). We confirmed this pattern by checking the published human fetal brain single-cell RNA-seq data ( Nowakowski et al., 2017 67. Nowakowski, T.J. ∙ Bhaduri, A. ∙ Pollen, A.A. ... Spatiotemporal gene expression trajectories reveal developmental hierarchies of the human cortex Science. 2017; 358 :1318-1323 Crossref Scopus (220) PubMed Google Scholar ). Interestingly, the HSL target genes are enriched in excitatory projection neurons from the cortical deep layer, and this enrichment is the most prominent in the excitatory neurons of SP ( Figure 4 B). In contrast, the target genes of the macaque specific loops are not enriched in any lamina ( Figure S4 C). We also checked the target genes of the human-macaque shared loops (not present in mouse), and we saw a significant enrichment in ventricular zone (VZ) ( Figure S4 C), consistent with the view that the primate brains have an enlarged neural progenitor pool compared with rodents ( Lui et al., 2011 57. Lui, J.H. ∙ Hansen, D.V. ∙ Kriegstein, A.R. Development and evolution of the human neocortex Cell. 2011; 146 :18-36 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (677) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, the target genes of the human-macaque shared loops are slightly enriched in excitatory SP neurons, but statistically not significant ( Figure S4 D).
We then explored the function of the HSL target genes. First, we performed gene co-expression module enrichment analysis using the modules identified in the previous report ( Miller et al., 2014 62. Miller, J.A. ∙ Ding, S.L. ∙ Sunkin, S.M. ... Transcriptional landscape of the prenatal human brain Nature. 2014; 508 :199-206 Crossref Scopus (550) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that the HSL target genes were significantly enriched in five modules (M6, M16, M26, M34, and M38) ( Figures S4 E and S4F). The most enriched module is M16, which is enriched in SP, and the function of M16 is related to synaptic transmission and synaptogenesis ( Figure 4 C), consistent with the known function of SP ( Judaš et al., 2013 35. Judaš, M. ∙ Sedmak, G. ∙ Kostović, I. The significance of the subplate for evolution and developmental plasticity of the human brain Front. Hum. Neurosci. 2013; 7 :423 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ). Of note, there are many synapse-related genes regulated by HSLs in M16, such as NLGN1 , one of the synaptic cell-adhesion molecules that mediate synapse formation ( Figure 4 C). Alterations of NLGN1 have been implicated in autism and other cognitive diseases ( Dean and Dresbach, 2006 12. Dean, C. ∙ Dresbach, T. Neuroligins and neurexins: linking cell adhesion, synapse formation and cognitive function Trends Neurosci. 2006; 29 :21-29 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (222) PubMed Google Scholar ). The other four enriched modules are involved in regulation of transcription (M6), long-term depression (M26), DNA replication (M34) and cell cycle (M38) ( Figure S4 F). These data suggest HSLs regulate genes in several functional modules, especially synapse development of the SP neurons.
Next, we performed Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis, and the results show that the HSL target genes are related to biological processes such as axon guidance, neuron migration, and synapse assembly ( Figures S4 G and S4H; Table S4 ). Axon guidance plays an important role in shaping neuron circuits ( Stoeckli, 2018 92. Stoeckli, E.T. Understanding axon guidance: are we nearly there yet? Development. 2018; 145 :dev151415 Crossref Scopus (72) PubMed Google Scholar ). Many genes involved in the axon guidance pathway are regulated by HSLs, especially genes encoding key guidance molecules (ephrins and semaphorins) such as EPHA7 and SEMA3A ( Figure 4 D). Altogether, these results further support our hypothesis that the human-specific chromatin interactions play a key role in human cortex development, especially the human-specific changes in the SP lamina during early neural circuit development.
One promising HSL target gene is EPHA7 . It is SP-preferentially expressed and upregulated in humans compared with macaque ( Figures 4 E–4G), and can influence cortical dendritic development and spine maturation ( Clifford et al., 2014 8. Clifford, M.A. ∙ Athar, W. ∙ Leonard, C.E. ... EphA7 signaling guides cortical dendritic development and spine maturation Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111 :4994-4999 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). We identified a human-specific loop showing enhancer-promoter interaction in the human fetal brain ( Figure 4 H). Concordantly, the enhancer activity in macaque is much weaker than that in human ( Figure 4 H). Furthermore, the enhancer in HSL anchor is brain-specific compared with other human fetal tissues ( Kundaje et al., 2015 45. Kundaje, A. ∙ Meuleman, W. ∙ Ernst, J. ..., Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium Integrative analysis of 111 reference human epigenomes Nature. 2015; 518 :317-330 Crossref Scopus (2646) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures 5 A and 5B). We used a luciferase assay to validate the enhancer activity among species, the results show that the enhancer activity in human is significantly higher than those of chimpanzee and macaque ( Figure 5 C). We compared the enhancer sequences among species and found six evolutionarily conserved sites that only changed in the human lineage ( Figure 5 D). These six human-specific single nucleotide changes (SNCs) formed new potential transcription factor (TF) binding sites in human ( Figure 5 D). Therefore, we speculate that the new TF binding sites may induce human-specific chromatin interaction changes, leading to expression divergence between human and macaque ( Figure 4 G).
To explore the functional role of the enhancer regulating human EPHA7 , we disturbed the enhancer sequence using the CRISPR-Cas9 method ( Figure 5 E). Three deletions were introduced within the enhancer locus, resulting in a 50% reduction of EPHA7 expression in neurons differentiated from human NPCs ( Figures 5 F and 5G). Next, we evaluated whether the disturbed enhancer affects neuron dendrite development. We observed significantly longer dendrite length in neurons with the disturbed enhancer compared with the controls ( Figures 5 H and 5I). These data suggest that the human-specific enhancer of the SP-preferentially expressed EPHA7 gene plays an important role in early neural circuit development which may contribute to the unique traits of the human brain.
TFs can bind to specific DNA motifs within gene regulatory elements and influence the chromatin 3D conformation to determine cell fate during development ( Stadhouders et al., 2018 90. Stadhouders, R. ∙ Vidal, E. ∙ Serra, F. ... Transcription factors orchestrate dynamic interplay between genome topology and gene regulation during cell reprogramming Nat. Genet. 2018; 50 :238-249 Crossref Scopus (101) PubMed Google Scholar , 2019 91. Stadhouders, R. ∙ Filion, G.J. ∙ Graf, T. Transcription factors and 3D genome conformation in cell-fate decisions Nature. 2019; 569 :345-354 Crossref Scopus (85) PubMed Google Scholar ). To explore how TFs may interact with the human brain 3D genome and regulate SP cell fate decision, we performed motif binding site analysis in the open chromatin regions of the HSL and ConsL anchors using the ATAC-seq profile from CP ( STAR methods ). As expected, the architectural proteins such as CTCF and CTCFL fall in the top of the TF list ( Figure S5 A). The percentage of binding in anchors and the significance of enrichment show distinctive changes for some of the motifs between HSL and ConsL anchors ( Figures 6 A and 6B). Architectural proteins (CTCF and CTCFL) are less enriched in the HSL anchors compared to the ConsL ones, consistent with our previous finding that HSLs are less CTCF dependent than ConsLs using CTCF ChIP-seq ( Figures 6 B and S3 F). In contrast, the neural cell-type-related TFs are more enriched in HSLs compared to ConsLs. Notably, we found three NFI factors (NFIA, NFIC, and NFIX) enriched in the HSL anchors, which can repress self-renewal of neural stem cells and activate the expression of genes associated with neuronal and astrocyte differentiation ( Harris et al., 2015 25. Harris, L. ∙ Genovesi, L.A. ∙ Gronostajski, R.M. ... Nuclear factor one transcription factors: Divergent functions in developmental versus adult stem cell populations Dev. Dyn. 2015; 244 :227-238 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ). We obtained similar results in motif binding analysis when using the ATAC-seq profile from GZ ( Figure S5 B) and different motif enrichment methods ( Figure S5 C).
Next, we intend to know whether part of these HSL-preferred bindings is sequence driven (i.e., containing SNCs). We checked the enrichment in the human-specific SNCs for TFs showing HSL-binding preference ( Figure S5 D). Approximately 65% (11 out of 17) of these TFs with HSL-binding preference are significantly enriched in the human-specific SNCs ( Figure 6 C) (false discovery rate [FDR] <0.001), such as TGIF1, EOMES, and TBR1 ( Figure 6 D). The human-fixed SNC enrichment ratio in the TF set with HSL-binding preference (65%) is much higher than all TFs (30.3%) and the TF set without binding preference (33.7%) ( Figure S5 E, Fisher’s exact test, p = 0.0056 and p = 0.016, respectively). One example of the human-specific SNC that generates new binding site is the enhancer regulating AUTS2 ( Figure 3 K) that contains one human-specific SNC resulting in a new TGIF1 binding site in human ( Figures 6 E and 6F). TGIF1 has an important role in regulating neuronal morphogenesis ( Nakashima et al., 2018 64. Nakashima, H. ∙ Tsujimura, K. ∙ Irie, K. ... Canonical TGF-β Signaling Negatively Regulates Neuronal Morphogenesis through TGIF/Smad Complex-Mediated CRMP2 Suppression J. Neurosci. 2018; 38 :4791-4810 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We then asked how many HSL target genes are regulated by these TFs showing enrichment difference between ConsLs and HSLs. We define target genes of TFs by combining motif binding analysis of promoter and gene-TF co-expression ( STAR methods ). We generated TF-target gene networks for the TFs with HSL-binding preference ( Figure 6 G). In fact, some of the TFs are the HSL target genes themselves such as TBR1, NFIA, NFIX, and TCF4, which display different lamina-specificity in the expression data. TBR1 and NFIA are SP-enriched, while NEUROG1/2 , EOMES , and TGIF1 are germinal layers enriched ( Figure 6 H). Remarkably, TBR1 has the largest number of target genes and most of them show CPi/SP enrichment ( Figures 6 G and 6I). A former study has revealed that TBR1 gene loss affects SP formation and thalamocortical connectivity ( Hevner et al., 2001 30. Hevner, R.F. ∙ Shi, L. ∙ Justice, N. ... Tbr1 regulates differentiation of the preplate and layer 6 Neuron. 2001; 29 :353-366 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (612) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting that TBR1 might be one of the key TFs regulating SP neuron specialization.
Collectively, we show that TBR1 and NFIA are candidate TFs mediating expression of the HSL-regulated gene to determine the fate of human SP neurons. Our results also echo a recent study, in which they demonstrated that NFIA can act as FOXP2 coactivators to promote chromatin decondensation and regulate the maturation of early excitatory SP neurons ( Hickey et al., 2019 31. Hickey, S.L. ∙ Berto, S. ∙ Konopka, G. Chromatin Decondensation by FOXP2 Promotes Human Neuron Maturation and Expression of Neurodevelopmental Disease Genes Cell Rep. 2019; 27 :1699-1711 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Former studies have shown that sequence changes in the genome may cause chromatin structural changes and pathogenic phenotypes ( Lupiáñez et al., 2015 58. Lupiáñez, D.G. ∙ Kraft, K. ∙ Heinrich, V. ... Disruptions of topological chromatin domains cause pathogenic rewiring of gene-enhancer interactions Cell. 2015; 161 :1012-1025 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (829) PubMed Google Scholar ; Spielmann et al., 2018 89. Spielmann, M. ∙ Lupiáñez, D.G. ∙ Mundlos, S. Structural variation in the 3D genome Nat. Rev. Genet. 2018; 19 :453-467 Crossref Scopus (137) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, we proceed to explore the sequence basis of the detected human-specific chromatin changes. The results suggesting that the HSL anchors are less conserved than the ConsL anchors when compared with chimpanzee and macaque ( Figure S6 A), and the between-species sequence divergence may contribute to HSL formation. We also checked whether HARs (human accelerated regions) ( Pollard et al., 2006 73. Pollard, K.S. ∙ Salama, S.R. ∙ Lambert, N. ... An RNA gene expressed during cortical development evolved rapidly in humans Nature. 2006; 443 :167-172 Crossref Scopus (638) PubMed Google Scholar ; Doan et al., 2016 16. Doan, R.N. ∙ Bae, B.I. ∙ Cubelos, B. ..., Homozygosity Mapping Consortium for Autism Mutations in Human Accelerated Regions Disrupt Cognition and Social Behavior Cell. 2016; 167 :341-354.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (94) PubMed Google Scholar ) are enriched in HSLs. The results indicate that the HSL anchors are significantly enriched for HARs (compared to random regions, permutation test, p = 1.07 × 10 −38 , and compared to ConsL anchors, Fisher’s exact test, p = 0.04) ( Figure 7 A). In particular, we identified 45 HARs located within the HSL anchors including enhancers or promoters ( Figure 7 B). In some cases, both anchors of a HSL contain HARs, and other cases show one HAR associated with multiple HSLs ( Figure 7 B). Interestingly, we found one HAR (ANC584) located within an HSL anchor on human chromosome 12 ( Figure 7 C). Both ChIP-seq (H3K4me1) and ATAC-seq data suggest ANC584 overlaps with an enhancer and show higher activity in human compared to macaque. The Hi-C data indicate that ANC584 may regulate the SP-preferentially expressed gene- SOX5 ( Figure 7 C), providing an example of how HARs may cause human-specific regulatory changes through spatial chromatin interaction in the SP laminae of the developing brain.
Next, we investigated the role of human-specific structural variants (SVs) in the formation of the human specific chromatin structure. We obtained the human-specific SV profile (human versus great apes) from the published data ( Dennis et al., 2017 14. Dennis, M.Y. ∙ Harshman, L. ∙ Nelson, B.J. ... The evolution and population diversity of human-specific segmental duplications Nat. Ecol. Evol. 2017; 1 :69 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kronenberg et al., 2018 44. Kronenberg, Z.N. ∙ Fiddes, I.T. ∙ Gordon, D. ... High-resolution comparative analysis of great ape genomes Science. 2018; 360 :eaar6343 Crossref Scopus (103) PubMed Google Scholar ; McLean et al., 2011 61. McLean, C.Y. ∙ Reno, P.L. ∙ Pollen, A.A. ... Human-specific loss of regulatory DNA and the evolution of human-specific traits Nature. 2011; 471 :216-219 Crossref Scopus (287) PubMed Google Scholar ). We checked the relationship between the human-specific SVs and HSL. We found 165 human-specific SVs overlapped with 161 HSL anchors ( Figure 7 D). We investigated if the human-specific SVs cause changes at the TAD level. We found 60 human-specific SVs located in 48 hgTAD boundaries and 74 human-specific SVs located in 57 hlTAD boundaries ( Figure 7 D). There are no significant differences of gene expression around the SV-overlapped hgTAD and hlTAD boundaries compared with the background, and no neural-related functions are enriched ( Figures S6 B and S6C). However, the ratio of upregulated gene in human compared with macaque is higher in the SV-overlapped hlTAD boundaries than the SV-overlapped hgTAD boundaries ( Figure S6 B). For example, a human-specific insertion (316 bp) is overlapped with an hlTAD boundary near the MAP4K3 gene ( Figures 7 E and 7F). Interestingly, this hlTAD boundary is tissue-specific. It is absent in human fetal brain ( Won et al., 2016 99. Won, H. ∙ de la Torre-Ubieta, L. ∙ Stein, J.L. ... Chromosome conformation elucidates regulatory relationships in developing human brain Nature. 2016; 538 :523-527 Crossref Scopus (199) PubMed Google Scholar ), adult hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, and neural progenitor cells ( Schmitt et al., 2016 81. Schmitt, A.D. ∙ Hu, M. ∙ Jung, I. ... A Compendium of Chromatin Contact Maps Reveals Spatially Active Regions in the Human Genome Cell Rep. 2016; 17 :2042-2059 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (272) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures S6 D and S6E). Nevertheless, it is present in human small bowel and spleen, and in chimpanzee and bonobo ( Zhang et al., 2019 103. Zhang, Y. ∙ Li, T. ∙ Preissl, S. ... Transcriptionally active HERV-H retrotransposons demarcate topologically associating domains in human pluripotent stem cells Nat. Genet. 2019; 51 :1380-1388 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures S6 E and S6F). More importantly, associating with this human-specific loss of TAD boundary, the TMEM178A gene (also a SP marker gene) gains an HSL that are absent in macaque and mouse ( Figures 6 F and S6 G), which may explain the observed higher expression of TMEM178A in the human fetal brain compared to macaque through “enhancer hijacking” ( Northcott et al., 2014 66. Northcott, P.A. ∙ Lee, C. ∙ Zichner, T. ... Enhancer hijacking activates GFI1 family oncogenes in medulloblastoma Nature. 2014; 511 :428-434 Crossref Scopus (276) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 7 G).
The presented data indicate the close involvement of human-specific genetic changes (HARs and SVs) in forming chromatin structural changes during human brain development, and we discovered cases showing SP-related changes in humans, suggesting SP is an important developmental lamina that has not been studied adequately.

Section: Discussion

We constructed an ultra-deep 3D genome map of macaque fetal brain and carried out comparative evolutionary analysis among human, rhesus macaque, and mouse at 3D genome level. We uncovered a prominent feature of HSLs (i.e., the enrichment of enhancer-enhancer interactions). Together with the enhancer-promoter interactions, they form regulatory communities. A former study found loops that appear during cell differentiation were more enriched in enhancer-enhancer interactions than static loops ( Phanstiel et al., 2017 71. Phanstiel, D.H. ∙ Van Bortle, K. ∙ Spacek, D. ... Static and Dynamic DNA Loops form AP-1-Bound Activation Hubs during Macrophage Development Mol. Cell. 2017; 67 :1037-1048.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (85) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our data suggest that, not only cell-type-specific loops but also species-specific loops may directly mediate enhancer-enhancer interactions. Compared with promoters, enhancers are spatiotemporal specific and may change constantly during development ( Nord et al., 2013 65. Nord, A.S. ∙ Blow, M.J. ∙ Attanasio, C. ... Rapid and pervasive changes in genome-wide enhancer usage during mammalian development Cell. 2013; 155 :1521-1531 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (202) PubMed Google Scholar ). The precise control of gene expression may require more sophisticated enhancer-enhancer interactions in a tissue or cell-type-specific manner during human brain development. Additionally, genes regulated by multiple enhancers may have an enlarged expression spectrum because turning on and off one enhancer may have limited effect on gene expression, while the expression change can be quite large when two or more enhancers are involved ( Kieffer-Kwon et al., 2013 40. Kieffer-Kwon, K.R. ∙ Tang, Z. ∙ Mathe, E. ... Interactome maps of mouse gene regulatory domains reveal basic principles of transcriptional regulation Cell. 2013; 155 :1507-1520 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (214) PubMed Google Scholar ). Hence, this multi-enhancer regulation is likely an acquired mechanism for the fine-tuning of human brain development.
SP, the largest transient zone expanded in the human fetal brain, is approximately four times thicker than the cortical plate during mid-gestation ( Kostovic and Molliver, 1974 42. Kostovic, I. ∙ Molliver, M.E. New interpretation of laminar development of cerebral cortex synaptogenesis in different layers of neopallium in human fetus Anat. Rec. 1974; 178 :395 Google Scholar ; Kostovic and Rakic, 1990 43. Kostovic, I. ∙ Rakic, P. Developmental history of the transient subplate zone in the visual and somatosensory cortex of the macaque monkey and human brain J. Comp. Neurol. 1990; 297 :441-470 Crossref Scopus (675) PubMed Google Scholar ). SP has an important role in establishment of thalamocortical connection and contributes to cortical lamination through migration to cortical deep layer ( Kanold et al., 2003 37. Kanold, P.O. ∙ Kara, P. ∙ Reid, R.C. ... Role of subplate neurons in functional maturation of visual cortical columns Science. 2003; 301 :521-525 Crossref Scopus (213) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ozair et al., 2018 68. Ozair, M.Z. ∙ Kirst, C. ∙ van den Berg, B.L. ... hPSC Modeling Reveals that Fate Selection of Cortical Deep Projection Neurons Occurs in the Subplate Cell Stem Cell. 2018; 23 :60-73.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ). A recent study reported that human accelerated conserved noncoding sequences regulate genes enriched in SP, which might be involved in human specific neurodevelopment ( Miller et al., 2014 62. Miller, J.A. ∙ Ding, S.L. ∙ Sunkin, S.M. ... Transcriptional landscape of the prenatal human brain Nature. 2014; 508 :199-206 Crossref Scopus (550) PubMed Google Scholar ). We show that HSLs regulate genes mainly enriched in the SP lamina, implying that the SP neurons are important in neural circuit formation and plasticity during human brain development.
We investigated the role of HARs and human-specific SVs in forming human-specific chromatin structures. However, different from the former study showing that 42% HARs interact with the flanking gene promoters ( Doan et al., 2016 16. Doan, R.N. ∙ Bae, B.I. ∙ Cubelos, B. ..., Homozygosity Mapping Consortium for Autism Mutations in Human Accelerated Regions Disrupt Cognition and Social Behavior Cell. 2016; 167 :341-354.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (94) PubMed Google Scholar ), we observe that HARs may occur within the enhancer-enhancer mediated HSL anchors, suggesting that HARs can work in different ways to regulate gene expression in the developing human brain. On the other hand, although the chromatin landscape constrains SVs within humans and across primate evolution ( Fudenberg and Pollard, 2019 20. Fudenberg, G. ∙ Pollard, K.S. Chromatin features constrain structural variation across evolutionary timescales Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2019; 116 :2175-2180 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ), we identified 134 human-specific SVs located in the human-specific TAD boundaries. Importantly, we found that the SVs overlapped with the hlTAD boundaries may contribute to the detected regulatory changes during SP development. To fully understand the contribution of the human-specific genetic changes (such as HARs and SVs), more omics and functional experiments are needed.
We show that four TE families are enriched in the hgTAD boundaries, especially the two young TE subfamilies (AluY and L1PA), which may contribute to hgTAD formation and influence gene expression during human brain development. Currently, how TEs regulate TAD boundary formation is still in question. Two possible mechanisms have been proposed: (1) the transcriptional activity of TEs can decide TAD boundary formation ( Zhang et al., 2019 103. Zhang, Y. ∙ Li, T. ∙ Preissl, S. ... Transcriptionally active HERV-H retrotransposons demarcate topologically associating domains in human pluripotent stem cells Nat. Genet. 2019; 51 :1380-1388 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ); and (2) other proteins can compete with CTCF in binding TEs to form TAD boundaries ( Kaaij et al., 2019 36. Kaaij, L.J.T. ∙ Mohn, F. ∙ van der Weide, R.H. ...

Kaaij et al. (2019) 36. Kaaij, L.J.T. ∙ Mohn, F. ∙ van der Weide, R.H. ... The ChAHP Complex Counteracts Chromatin Looping at CTCF Sites that Emerged from SINE Expansions in Mouse Cell. 2019; 178 :1437-1451.e14 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar reported the ChAHP complex (CHD4, ADNP, HP1) can bind to SINE B2 transposable elements and compete with CTCF in forming TAD boundaries in mouse. We therefore speculate that those TEs enriched in the hgTAD boundaries may provide binding sites for neural-development-related TFs and promote formation of the hgTAD boundaries.
It should be noted that we used liftover to get the corresponding locations of TAD boundaries and loop anchors when performing cross-species analyses. Therefore, the non-syntenic regions were mostly excluded in this process, which may give an inflated picture of the overall conservation of 3D genome architecture. We find most human TADs and loops are located in the syntenic regions ( Figures S7 A and S7B), and the conservation levels of TADs and loops in the syntenic regions are slightly overestimated due to the low conservation of the non-syntenic regions ( Figures S7 C and S7D). The non-syntenic TADs and loops are associated with different types of genome structural changes during evolution such as translocations, inversions, and large gaps ( Figure S7 E). We presented examples to show how these non-syntenic regions affect the evolution of human chromatin structures ( Figures S7 F and S7G). More accurate genome landscape (such as a high-quality macaque reference genome) ( He et al., 2019 27. He, Y. ∙ Luo, X. ∙ Zhou, B. ... Long-read assembly of the Chinese rhesus macaque genome and identification of ape-specific structural variants Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :4233 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ) would be needed to better understand the relationship between non-syntenic regions and 3D genome architectures.
In summary, we generated a high-resolution 3D genome profile of NHP during corticogenesis, which allowed us to reveal the human-specific 3D genome changes through cross-species analyses. Comparative 3D genome analyses are powerful approaches in deciphering the regulatory mechanisms of brain development and evolution.

Fetal brain of rhesus macaque was obtained from Kunming Primate Research Center, Kunming Institute of Zoology. All animal procedures were conducted following the international standards, and were approved in advance by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (Approval No: SMKX-2017021).
We collected three fetal brains of rhesus macaque ( Macaca mulatta ) at mid-gestation (E84), and the fronto-parietal cortex was dissected. The brains were kept in ice-cold DMEM/F12 (GIBCO, 11320033) during dissection. Under a dissection microscope, the coronal sections were divided into two major zones: CP - consisting primarily of post-mitotic neurons, including the marginal zone (MZ), cortical plate (CP) and subplate (SP) and GZ - consisting primarily of neural progenitors, containing intermediate zone (IZ), outer subventricular zone (OSVZ), inner subventricular zone (ISVZ) and ventricular zone (VZ). The dissected tissues were further cut into small pieces and digested in TrypLE Express Enzyme (GIBCO, 12604021). The tissues were vortexed and kept at 37°C for 10 min. The cell suspension was pipetted further to disperse into single cells and centrifuged at 300 g for 5 mins to obtain cell pellets. The digestion medium was carefully removed, the cells were washed twice with PBS. Finally, the cell pellets were re-suspended in 1ml DMEM medium (GIBCO, 12430054) and kept on ice. The cells were divided into two parts: one was crosslinked by formaldehyde for Hi-C, DNase-seq and ChIP-seq, and the other was immediately frozen for RNA-seq. Cells were fixed by final concentration of 1% formaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich, F1635), mixed for 10 mins at room temperature. Fixation was quenched using 2.5 M glycine at room temperature for 5 mins and immediately centrifuged at 800 g for 10 mins. Supernatant was removed and frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C until further use.
Human neural progenitor cells (NPCs) induced from human iPSC were expanded by plating on Poly-L-ornithine (Sigma, P4957) and Laminin (GIBCO, 23017015) coated plates with proliferation media [Neurobasal media (GIBCO, 21103049), 1% N2 supplement (GIBCO, A1370701), 2% B27 (GIBCO, 17504044), 20 ng ml −1 basic fibroblast growth factor (GIBCO, 13256029) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin] following the published protocols ( Gunhanlar et al., 2018 23. Gunhanlar, N. ∙ Shpak, G. ∙ van der Kroeg, M. ... A simplified protocol for differentiation of electrophysiologically mature neuronal networks from human induced pluripotent stem cells Mol. Psychiatry. 2018; 23 :1336-1344 Crossref Scopus (65) PubMed Google Scholar ). For differentiation, NPCs were cultured in the differentiation media composed of Neurobasal, N2, B27, NEAA (Sigma, M7145), 1% Glutmax (Sigma, 3505061), 10 ng/ml BDNF (GIBCO, PHC7074) and 10 ng/ml GDNF (GIBCO, PHC7041), 1 μM Dibutyryl CAMP (Sigma, D0627), 200 μM ascorbic acid (Sigma, A5960) and 1% penicillin/ streptomycin. Half of the media was replaced by fresh medium every 3 days. All cells were incubated at 37°C and 5% CO 2 .
Hi-C libraries were constructed based on the published Hi-C 2.0 protocol ( Belaghzal et al., 2017 2. Belaghzal, H. ∙ Dekker, J. ∙ Gibcus, J.H. Hi-C 2.0: An optimized Hi-C procedure for high-resolution genome-wide mapping of chromosome conformation Methods. 2017; 123 :56-65 Crossref Scopus (90) PubMed Google Scholar ). Five million fixed cells were re-suspended in lysis buffer (final concentration of 10 mMTris, pH 8.0, 10 mM NaCl, 0.2% Igepal CA-630 and 1 × cOmplete protease inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich, 11697498001) and incubated on ice for 10 mins. Removal of lysis buffer was done by centrifugation at 2500 g for 5 mins at 4°C, followed by removal of supernatant. The pellet was re-suspended in 342 μL 1 × NEBuffer 3.1, and incubated with 38 μL 10% SDS at 65°C for 10 mins. Next, 43 μL of 10% Triton X-100 was added to the Hi-C-tube to quench the SDS at 37°C for 15min. We then add 12 μL 10 × NEBuffer 3.1 and 400U DpnII (NEB, R0543), and mix gently to digest the chromatin overnight at 37°C on a rocking platform. On the next day, the DpnII restriction enzyme was inactivated at 65°C for 25 mins. Then, biotin-14-dATP (Life Technologies, 19524-016), dCTP, dGTP, dTTP and DNA polymerase I Kenow were added (NEB, M0210), and incubated at 23°C for 4 h. The digested chromatin was diluted and re-ligated by T4 DNA ligase (NEB, M0202), incubated at 16°C for 4 h, and shaken manually for three times. The chromatin products were de-cross-linked overnight by adding 30 μL proteinase K, and incubated at 65°C overnight. The DNAs were extracted and dissolved in 50ul 10 mMTris, pH 8.0. Then T4 DNA polymerase (NEB, M0203) was used to remove biotin from un-ligation ends for 4 hr at 20°C, and the enzymes were inactivated for 20 mins at 75°C. The DNAs were sheared to a size of 200-300 bp using Covaris M220. DNA size selection was conducted using AMpure XP magnetic beads (Beckman Coulter, A63881). Biotin pulldown was performed with Streptavidin T1 beads (Life Technologies, 65602). End repair, A adding, adaptor adding reaction, PCR amplification and DNA products size selection were performed sequentially. The libraries were sequenced by the Illumina PE150 paired-end sequencing platform.
DNase-seq processing followed the published protocol with slight modifications for our samples ( He et al., 2014 26. He, H.H. ∙ Meyer, C.A. ∙ Hu, S.S. ...

One million fixed cells were re-suspended in 1 mL buffer A+ (15 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 15 mM NaCl, 60 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.5 mM EGTA, pH 8.0, 0.15mM Spermine, 0.5mM Spermidine, 1 x PIC 50 × 200ul, 1mM PMSF, 0.5mM DTT, 0.2% NP40), digested on ice for 10 minutes, and centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 3 mins. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was re-suspended in 500ul 37°C pre-warmed 1x digestion buffer. 25U DNaseI (Roche, 4716728001) was added and inverted to mix, and incubated at 37°C for 5 mins. 500ul stop buffer was added (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 0.10% SDS, 100 mM EDTA, pH 8.0 with spermine, spermidine, and 2ul of RNase) to each reaction and mixed by inverting. The chromatin products were de-cross-linked overnight, and incubated at 65°C overnight. DNA extraction, end repair, A adding, adaptor adding reaction and PCR amplification were performed sequentially. The PCR products were run on a 2% agarose gel, the 180-500bp fragments were selected by gel cutting. The size selected DNAs were purified using QIAGEN Gel Purification Kit. The libraries were sequenced by the Illumina PE150 paired-end sequencing platform.
Five million fixed cells were re-suspended in cold cell lysis buffer (10mM Tris pH 8, 10mM NaCl, 0.2% NP-40, 1xEDTA-free Protease Inhibitors). Cells were lysed for 10 mins, washed once with cold PBS and re-suspended in 100ul per IP cold nuclei lysis buffer (50mM Tris pH8, 10mM EDTA, 1% SDS, 1xProtease Inhibitors). Nuclei were lysed for 15 mins at 4°C and then sonicated for 20 cycles using Bioruptor (Diagenode). After sonication, 5x volumes of IP dilution buffer (20mM Tris pH8, 2mM EDTA, 150mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.01% SDS, 1x protease inhibitors) was added, and chromatin was precleared using 25ul Protein A dynabeads (ThermoFisher, 10002D) / 1mL for 1hrs at 4°C with rotation. Beads were then washed once with 0.5% BSA in PBS, and added to the precleared chromatin and incubated overnight at 4°C with rotation. Beads were then washed once with cold IP wash buffer 1 (20mM Tris pH8, 2mM EDTA, 50mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS), twice with high salt wash buffer (20mM Tris pH8, 2mM EDTA, 500mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100,0.1% SDS), once with cold IP wash buffer 2 (10mM Tris pH8,1mM EDTA,250mM LiCl,1% NP-40,1% sodium deoxycholate) and twice with cold TE buffer (1mM Tris pH8, 1mM EDTA).

RNA was extracted from GZ and CP cells using the QIAGEN miRNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN, 217004). Concentration and purity were evaluated with a NanoDrop. 2 μg total RNA per sample was used as input material for the RNA sample preparation. Library preparation was completed using the VAHTS Total RNA-seq Library Prep Kit for Illumina (Vazyme, NR603-01) following the manufacturer’s recommendations. The libraries were sequenced by the Illumina PE150 paired-end sequencing platform.
Oligopaint libraries were designed using the OligoMiner pipeline ( Beliveau et al., 2018 3. Beliveau, B.J. ∙ Kishi, J.Y. ∙ Nir, G. ... OligoMiner provides a rapid, flexible environment for the design of genome-scale oligonucleotide in situ hybridization probes Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115 :E2183-E2192 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ). We run OligoMiner on the rheMac8 reference genome with the “balance” parameter sets (36-41 nucleotide homology length) using LDM and kmerFilter. Probes were designed to target a 70 Kb region at a density of about 5.17 probes per kilobase (Table S2).
Frozen fetal monkey brain was coronally sectioned at 8 μm. The tissues were fixed using 4% PFA for 10min at room temperature, washed with PBS for three times, then permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 (Sigma, 10789704001) in PBS for 15min at room temperature and treated with 100ug/ml RNaseA at 37°C for 45 min. The slides were incubated in 0.5M HCl for 10 min at room temperature, washed with 2 × SSC (Thermo Fisher Scientific, AM9763), and treated with 0.01M HCl/0.0025% pepsin (Macklin, P6322-100 g) for 10min at 37°C. The pepsin was then inactivated by washing with 50mM Mgcl 2 /PBS for twice, and the slides were washed with 2 × SSC for three times, then incubated in 50% of Formamide (Sigma, S6639-1L) with 2 × SSC overnight at 4°C. In the next day, the cells were predenatured at 78°C for 10min and put into 70%, 90% and 100% cold ethanol for 2 min sequentially and then air-dried. The 1st probes were denatured at 86°C for 5min and put quickly on ice. Then the probes were loaded on slide areas with cells, and the slides were incubated at 86°C for 3min and put quickly on ice, hybridized at 42°C overnight in a dark and humidified chamber. In the next day, the slides were washed with 2 × SSC/0.1% Tri-tonX-100 for three times at 60°C. The 2st probes were added on the slides and incubated at room temperature for 1h. The slides were washed with 40% Formamide/2 × SSC one time and 30% Formamide/2 × SSC two times, mounted by ProLong Diamond Antifade Mountant with DAPI (ThermoFisher Scientific, P36966).
We designed four sgRNAs to disturb the human EPHA7 enhancer using the guide RNA design tool CHOPCHOP ( http://chopchop.cbu.uib.no/ ) (sgRNA1: CCCTAAATTCAGGAACTATT; sgRNA2: GGCTTGACTCAACTGACCAA; sgRNA3: TAGTTACTCTCTGCACAACC; sgRNA4: GCCAAATTCATGTCGTTTCC). sgRNAs were cloned into the pL-CRISPR.EFS.GFP (Addgene, 57818) or pL-CRISPR.EFS.tRFP (Addgene, 57819) plasmids ( Heckl et al., 2014 28. Heckl, D. ∙ Kowalczyk, M.S. ∙ Yudovich, D. ... Generation of mouse models of myeloid malignancy with combinatorial genetic lesions using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing Nat. Biotechnol. 2014; 32 :941-946 Crossref Scopus (276) PubMed Google Scholar ). Lenti-virus were produced using 293T cells and concentrated with Lenti-X Concentrator reagent (Takara, 631231). Human NPCs were cultured and infected with the concentrated virus, and in the next day, the virus was removed and replaced with fresh medium. Two days later, the NPCs were differentiated by replacing differentiation medium and cultured for two weeks. The dual GFP/tRFP positive cells were isolated by FACS for genome DNA and RNA extraction. The sgRNAs efficiency were validated by PCR amplification of the human EPHA7 enhancer locus and the expression of EPHA7 was quantified by qPCR. EPHA7-enhancer PCR Primers: forward- ACTAGGTTTCTTGGTGTTCATTCCC, reverse- TTGTACAGTCCCTCTATCACATGCA; qPCR primers: GAPDH forward- GTCTCCTCTGACTTCAACAGCG, GAPDH reverse: ACCACCCTGTTGCTG-TAGCCAA, EPHA7 forward- CTCGCAAGTGAGTGGAGTAATG, EPHA7 reverse- GTTGAGTAGGTCCGTTCCCTTTG.
The differentiated neurons were fixed with 4% PFA, permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100, blocked with 10% BSA, and incubated with primary antibodies GFP (Abcam, ab13970, 1:1000) at 4°C overnight, then incubated with secondary antibodies at 25°C for 1 h, counterstained with DAPI. Digital image acquisition was performed using LEICA TCS SP8 microscope. ImageJ was used to measure dendrite length. Each group was repeated with three replicates, and P values were calculated using t test.
Human SK-N-SH cells were cultured with basic growth media (DMEM, 10%FBS, 2 mM Glutamine and 1x Pen/Strep). The human EHAP7 enhancer and the orthologous chimpanzee and macaque sequences were cloned into the pGL3-promoter vector (Promega, E1761). 500 ng pGL3-EPHA7-promoter or pGL3-promoter and 20ng pRL-TK (Promega) were transfected into SK-N-SH cells in 24-well plates using lipofectamine 3000. After 48 hours, cells were washed for three times using PBS, and luciferase activity was measured by Dual Luferase Reporter System (Promega). Each group was repeated with six technical replicates. Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity. P values were calculated using t test.
Five million cross-linked cells were re-suspended in lysis buffer and incubated on ice for 15 mins. Removal of lysis buffer was done by centrifugation at 2500 g for 5 mins at 4°C, followed by removal of supernatant. The pellet was re-suspended in 342 μL 1 × NEBuffer 3.1, and incubated with 38 μL 10% SDS at 65°C for 10 mins. Next, 43 μL of 10% Triton X-100 was added to the Hi-C-tube to quench the SDS at 37°C for 15min, then add 12 μL 10 × NEBuffer 3.1 and 400U DpnII (NEB, R0543), and mix gently to digest the chromatin overnight at 37°C on a rocking platform. In the next day, the DpnII re-striction enzyme was inactivated at 65°C for 25 mins. Then, re-ligated by T4 DNA ligase (NEB, M0202), incubated at 16°C for 4 h, and shaken manually for three times. The chromatin products were de-cross-linked overnight by adding 30 μL proteinase K, and incubated at 65°C overnight. Phenolic/chloroform was used to extract DNA. PCR and Sanger sequencing were carried out to confirm the long-range chromatin interaction. PCR primers are listed in Table S2.
The Fastq reads were aligned to reference genome (hg19 for human, rheMac8 for macaque, mm10 for mouse) using bowtie2 (v2.3.4) ( Langmead and Salzberg, 2012 49. Langmead, B. ∙ Salzberg, S.L. Fast gapped-read alignment with Bowtie 2 Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :357-359 Crossref Scopus (17046) PubMed Google Scholar ) with settings “bowtie2 –very-sensitive.” Bam files were transferred to sam files using Samtools (v1.9) ( Li et al., 2009 53. Li, H. ∙ Handsaker, B. ∙ Wysoker, A. ..., 1000 Genome Project Data Processing Subgroup The Sequence Alignment/Map format and SAMtools Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :2078-2079 Crossref Scopus (21853) PubMed Google Scholar ). Duplicated alignments were removed using PicardTools (v2.20.2) ( http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/ ). To avoid double contigs for the paired-end alignments, only one mate count. Only uniquely mapped alignments (MAPQ > 30) were kept. Averaged reads per million of mapped reads (RPM) in 10bp bins were calculated by deepTools (V3.2.1) ( Ramírez et al., 2014 76. Ramírez, F. ∙ Dündar, F. ∙ Diehl, S. ... deepTools: a flexible platform for exploring deep-sequencing data Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 :W187-91 Crossref Scopus (707) PubMed Google Scholar ) and transferred to coverage tracks. Technical replicates data were merged. Peaks were identified using MACS2 (V2.1.2) ( Zhang et al., 2008 102. Zhang, Y. ∙ Liu, T. ∙ Meyer, C.A. ... Model-based analysis of ChIP-Seq (MACS) Genome Biol. 2008; 9 :R137 Crossref Scopus (6096) PubMed Google Scholar ) with settings “macs2 call Peak –B –p 1e-5 –nomodle –extsize 200.”
The intra-species RNA-Seq Fastq reads were aligned to Mmul_8.0.1 reference genome ( ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-96/fasta/macaca_mulatta/dna/ ) using STAR (V2.6.16) ( Dobin et al., 2013 17. Dobin, A. ∙ Davis, C.A. ∙ Schlesinger, F. ... STAR: ultrafast universal RNA-seq aligner Bioinformatics. 2013; 29 :15-21 Crossref Scopus (10402) PubMed Google Scholar ). ENSEMBL gene annotation was used. Duplicated alignments were removed using PicardTools (v2.20.2) ( http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/ ). The number of alignments mapped to exons was counted using the summarizeOverlap function from the GenomicAlignments package (V1.18.1) ( Lawrence et al., 2013 50. Lawrence, M. ∙ Huber, W. ∙ Pagès, H. ... Software for computing and annotating genomic ranges PLoS Comput. Biol. 2013; 9 :e1003118 Crossref Scopus (1155) PubMed Google Scholar ). Conditional quantile normalization was performed using CQN package (V1.28.1) ( Hansen et al., 2012 24. Hansen, K.D. ∙ Irizarry, R.A. ∙ Wu, Z. Removing technical variability in RNA-seq data using conditional quantile normalization Biostatistics. 2012; 13 :204-216 Crossref Scopus (282) PubMed Google Scholar ) to correct read depth, exon length and GC content. Log2 normalized FPKM was used for quantification of expression levels. For inter-species RNA-Seq data comparison, we generated inter-species mRNA annotation in the way described in a previous study ( Zhu et al., 2018 105. Zhu, Y. ∙ Sousa, A.M.M. ∙ Gao, T. ... Spatiotemporal transcriptomic divergence across human and macaque brain development Science. 2018; 362 :eaat8077 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ) to minimize the bias of gene annotation across species. We generated human-macaque orthologous annotation based on human Gencode v19. In brief, the XSAnno ( Zhu et al., 2014 104. Zhu, Y. ∙ Li, M. ∙ Sousa, A.M.M. ... XSAnno: a framework for building ortholog models in cross-species transcriptome comparisons BMC Genomics. 2014; 15 :343 Crossref Scopus (4) PubMed Google Scholar ) method first liftOver human genome annotation to macaque, then low quality alignments was filtered out. The settings were, “-minMatch” 0.913, inter-species PID 0.9, PL 0.95, intra-species PID 0.97, PL 0.95. The human and macaque RNA-Seq data were aligned to hg19 and Mmul_8.0.1 respectively using STAR (V2.6.16) and the orthologous mRNA annotation. The reads mapped to genes were counted using featureCounts function from Rsubread packsge (V1.32.4) ( Liao et al., 2019 54. Liao, Y. ∙ Smyth, G.K. ∙ Shi, W. The R package Rsubread is easier, faster, cheaper and better for alignment and quantification of RNA sequencing reads Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 :e47 Crossref Scopus (197) PubMed Google Scholar ). FPKM was used for quantification of expression levels. Differential expression genes across species were identified using DESeq2 (V1.22.2) ( Love et al., 2014 56. Love, M.I. ∙ Huber, W. ∙ Anders, S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2 Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :550 Crossref Scopus (16017) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Paired-end reads of the Hi-C libraries were pre-processed using HiC-Pro (V2.9.0) as described in the previous report ( Servant et al., 2015 82. Servant, N. ∙ Varoquaux, N. ∙ Lajoie, B.R. ... HiC-Pro: an optimized and flexible pipeline for Hi-C data processing Genome Biol. 2015; 16 :259 Crossref Scopus (432) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, reads pairs were aligned to the reference genomes (hg19 for human, rheMac8 for macaque, and mm10 for mouse) in two steps. The first step aligns reads using bowtie2 end-to-end algorithm. The second step detect the ligation sites and the 5′ fraction of the reads were aligned back to the genome. Aligned read pairs were assigned to DpnII restriction fragments. Invalid pairs like dangling end were filtered out. The genome was divided into specific size bins, and valid pairs were counted per bins. We used 500 kb, 100 kb, 40 kb bin sizes to generate raw and ICE (iterative correction and eigenvector decomposition) ( Imakaev et al., 2012 34. Imakaev, M. ∙ Fudenberg, G. ∙ McCord, R.P. ... Iterative correction of Hi-C data reveals hallmarks of chromosome organization Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :999-1003 Crossref Scopus (527) PubMed Google Scholar ) normalized matrix. 500 kb matrix was used to identify compartments, 100 kb matrix was used to calculate Pearson correlation of replicates, and 40 kb matrix was used to define TAD boundaries. The valid pair files were transformed to .hic files which were ready for juicer (V1.11.04) ( Durand et al., 2016 18. Durand, N.C. ∙ Shamim, M.S. ∙ Machol, I. ... Juicer Provides a One-Click System for Analyzing Loop-Resolution Hi-C Experiments Cell Syst. 2016; 3 :95-98 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ) using pre command. We extracted KR (Knight-Ruiz) and VC_SQRT (square root of vanilla coverage) normalized matrix at 10 kb resolution. KR-normalized matrix was used to detect loops and to show Hi-C heatmaps. VC_SQRT-normalized matrix was used to show Hi-C heatmaps.
we defined and calculated the Hi-C map resolution as described in Rao et al. (2014) 77. Rao, S.S. ∙ Huntley, M.H. ∙ Durand, N.C. ... A 3D map of the human genome at kilobase resolution reveals principles of chromatin looping Cell. 2014; 159 :1665-1680 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2411) PubMed Google Scholar . The map resolution is defined as the smallest bin size where 80% of bins have at least 1,000 contact reads. The calculating scripts are from the published study
( https://github.com/aidenlab/juicer/blob/master/misc/calculate_map_resolution.sh .).
We assigned A/B compartments as described in the previous study ( Lieberman-Aiden et al., 2009 55. Lieberman-Aiden, E. ∙ van Berkum, N.L. ∙ Williams, L. ... Comprehensive mapping of long-range interactions reveals folding principles of the human genome Science. 2009; 326 :289-293 Crossref Scopus (3659) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, the expected contact frequency was calculated by the distance between the two loci. Pearson correlation matrix was calculated based on the observed/expected matrix. Principal component analysis was performed on the Pearson correlation matrix. The first principal component (PC1) was used to assign compartments. Eigenvalues with higher gene density was assigned as A compartment, otherwise assigned as B compartment.
We defined TAD boundaries by two methods: insulation score analysis and domain caller ( Dixon et al., 2012 15. Dixon, J.R. ∙ Selvaraj, S. ∙ Yue, F. ... Topological domains in mammalian genomes identified by analysis of chromatin interactions Nature. 2012; 485 :376-380 Crossref Scopus (3008) PubMed Google Scholar ; Crane et al., 2015 10. Crane, E. ∙ Bian, Q. ∙ McCord, R.P. ... Condensin-driven remodelling of X chromosome topology during dosage compensation Nature. 2015; 523 :240-244 Crossref Scopus (292) PubMed Google Scholar ). For insulation score analysis, local contact insulation score was calculated as described in the previous report. We calculated insulation score using 40 kb bin size and 800 kb sliding window size (average size of TAD). The insulation score was normalized by the mean of all bins per chromosome. Valleys along the normalized insulation score indicate the reduced Hi-C contact. The valleys were detected by the finding horizontal zero point of delta vector. We filtered the horizontal zero points at peaks. Boundaries with distance less than 40 kb were merged into one. For domain caller, we calculated directionality index in 40 kb bin size using 2 Mb window size. Then we inferred the true hidden directionality bias by hidden Markov model (HMM). Domains were inferred from the HMM state calls. Regions between TADs and less than 400 kb were defined as boundaries.
To test the insulation intensity of different types of boundaries, we defined insulation strength (see the illustration below). In brief, we calculated interactions within intra-TAD and inter-TAD 100 kb around a given boundary. Then we defined the ratio of (I intra- TAD – I inter-TAD ) and (I intra-TAD + I inter-TAD ) as insulation strength. Interactions in the diagonal were filtered out. I i n t e r − T A D ⁢ = I a + I b I i n t e r − T A D ⁢ = I c i n s u l a t i o n s t r e n g t h = I i n t r a − T A D ⁢ − I i n t e r − T A D I i n t r a − T A D ⁢ + I i n t e r − T A D Figure viewer
To compare boundaries across species, we liftOver ( Hinrichs et al., 2006 32. Hinrichs, A.S. ∙ Karolchik, D. ∙ Baertsch, R. ... The UCSC Genome Browser Database: update 2006 Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34 :D590-D598 Crossref Scopus (559) PubMed Google Scholar ) macaque’s and mouse’s boundaries to the human reference genome (hg19). If distance of two boundaries was less than 80 kb (2 bins), these two boundaries are defined as conserved boundaries of two species (see the illustration below). The boundary conserved in three species was defined as species-conserved boundary. To select the most-likely distinct boundaries, we defined species-specific boundary as distance more than 200 kb (5 bins). TADs flanked by the conserved boundaries at both sides are defined as conserved TADs. TADs flanked by the species-specific boundaries at least one side are defined as species-specific TADs. For the data shown in figures, we merged boundaries called from different brain regions (CP and GZ) or cell types (CN and NPC) for each species. Figure viewer
Repeat elements were downloaded from the UCSC Genome Browser ( http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/database/rmsk.txt.gz ). We calculated the density of repeat elements overlapped with Cons or HG TAD boundaries (numbers of repeat element per boundaries). Then we used t test to quantify the difference of repeat elements density between Cons and HG TAD boundaries.
We detected significantly enriched contact interactions using Hi-C computational Unbiased Peak Search (HiCCUPS) (V1.11.04) ( Durand et al., 2016 18. Durand, N.C. ∙ Shamim, M.S. ∙ Machol, I. ... Juicer Provides a One-Click System for Analyzing Loop-Resolution Hi-C Experiments Cell Syst. 2016; 3 :95-98 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ) with default settings as described in the previous study ( Rao et al., 2014 77. Rao, S.S. ∙ Huntley, M.H. ∙ Durand, N.C. ... A 3D map of the human genome at kilobase resolution reveals principles of chromatin looping Cell. 2014; 159 :1665-1680 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2411) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, fold change values quantifying enrichment of contact frequency compared to local background were calculated. Then we tested if the number of the observed contacts is significantly enriched. P value was Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted to correct for multiple tests. Pixels with enrichment in all local neighborhoods (donut, horizontal, vertical and lower right) were kept. Then cluster of nearby enriched pixels were analyzed using a greedy algorithm. To generate the maximum counts of reads, samples were merged for each brain zones. We detected loops at 10 kb resolution.
To test the enrichment of the detected loops, we performed the aggregated peak analysis (APA) using juicer tools (V1.11.04) ( Durand et al., 2016 18. Durand, N.C. ∙ Shamim, M.S. ∙ Machol, I. ... Juicer Provides a One-Click System for Analyzing Loop-Resolution Hi-C Experiments Cell Syst. 2016; 3 :95-98 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ) as described in the previous study ( Rao et al., 2014 77. Rao, S.S. ∙ Huntley, M.H. ∙ Durand, N.C. ... A 3D map of the human genome at kilobase resolution reveals principles of chromatin looping Cell. 2014; 159 :1665-1680 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2411) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, submatrices around peaks were taken from KR-normalized matrix and then summed. The APA matrix was plotted as the heatmap. APA score was calculated as ratio of number of reads in the center bin to average number of reads in the lower-left corner. APA score greater than 1 represents enrichment peak. Some APA scores labeled in figures were normalized by dividing all the submatrices by the mean value of the submatrix.
Cross-species loop comparison was achieved by the following pipeline. For each species, loops obtained from different brain zones or cell types are combined to get a concatenate loop list. The coordinates for loop anchors on target genome were obtained from source genome using UCSC liftOver and only loops with both anchors that can map to a 5kb to 20kb region are retained. LiftOver and reciprocal liftOver have to be unique. Anchors that have more than 50% overlapped with source coordinates during reciprocal liftOver are retained. Then the mapped position of each loop anchor was aligned to the unit resolution interval with the highest degree of coincidence.
For each mapped loop, two kinds of judgements were performed: the distance judgement which determines whether the mapped loop is located near any loop of target species and the enrichment judgement which determines whether the mapped loop still show signal enrichment in the Hi-C contact map of target species. The distance judgment is achieved by comparing the two-dimensional Euclidean distance between loops with some preset thresholds: 𝑑 𝑖 𝑠 𝑡 𝑎 𝑛 𝑐 𝑒 < m a x ⁡ ( 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑠 , m i n ⁡ ( 𝑟 1 × | 𝑖 − 𝑗 | , 𝑟 2 ) )
Here, the radius which is the output of HiCCUPS represents the surrounding area of corresponding target species loop and | 𝑖 − 𝑗 | represents the distance between two anchors of it, while 𝑟 1 and 𝑟 2 are relative distance coefficient and absolute distance threshold, respectively, which are preset parameters, and 0.2 and 20kb used for identifying conserved loops while 0.2 and 50kb used for finding species-specific loops.
The enrichment judgement was performed to check whether the mapped loops showed signal enrichment over the local background. Matrices were normalized and the expected normalized contacts at each distance were calculated. For each mapped loop, we defined several local neighborhoods as described by Rao et al. (2014) 77. Rao, S.S. ∙ Huntley, M.H. ∙ Durand, N.C. ... A 3D map of the human genome at kilobase resolution reveals principles of chromatin looping Cell. 2014; 159 :1665-1680 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2411) PubMed Google Scholar : donut, horizontal, vertical, and lower left. For each neighborhood, ratio of sum of the observed counts to sum of expected counts were calculated and then multiplied by the expected signal of the mapped loop, and this value is the estimation of expected contacts for the corresponding neighborhood. Then the fold-changes of observed contacts of mapped loop over the expected contacts of four kinds of neighborhoods are calculated separately. We calculated these four kinds of fold-changes for each enriched-pixel of target species and selected 20% quantiles of them to be thresholds. For example, when the target species is mouse, a mapped loop with fold-change of observed versus expected (horizontal and vertical) > 1.5, fold-change of observed versus expected (lower-left and donut) > 1.65, fold-change of observed versus expected (lower-left or donut) > 1.76 is considered as signal enriched. Otherwise, if all the fold-changes above are less than 1.3, the mapped loop is considered as no-enriched pixel. Combining the distance judgement and enrichment judgement, we can determine whether a mapped loop is species-conserved or species-specific in the following way: a mapped loop which is close enough to a loop of target species or has signal enrichment over local background will be considered as species-conserved; if it’s separated from all the loops of target species and determined as no-enriched pixel, it will be considered as species-specific. It should be noted that here we do not classify all the loops, but use different parameters when identifying conserved and species-specific loops to ensure that both loop sets are credible.

GO enrichment was performed on genes with promoter overlapped boundaries (20kb around) or loop anchors. Promoters were defined as upstream 2 kb and downstream 2kb of transcription start site (TSS). Biological process, cellular component and molecular function gene ontology were performed using DAVID ( Dennis et al., 2003 13. Dennis, Jr., G. ∙ Sherman, B.T. ∙ Hosack, D.A. ... DAVID: Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery Genome Biol. 2003; 4 :3 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ).
We use chromatin epigenomic features to infer enhancer activity. For all of the analyses, enhancers of human were defined as regions with an H3K4me1 peak of human fetal brain (E081) from the Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium ( Ernst and Kellis, 2015 19.

Enhancers of macaque were defined as regions with an H3K4me2 or H3K27ac peak of 12 PCW macaque frontal cortex from Reilly et al. (2015) 78. Reilly, S.K. ∙ Yin, J. ∙ Ayoub, A.E. ... Evolutionary genomics.

Enhancers of mouse were defined as regions with H3K4me1 peaks of mouse cortical neurons from Bonev et al. (2017) 5. Bonev, B. ∙ Mendelson Cohen, N. ∙ Szabo, Q. ...

To find enriched motif for transcription factor binding sites in ATAC-Seq peaks (for human) or DNase-I Hypersensitivity (DNase) peaks (for macaque and mouse) which overlapped with loop anchors, we obtained motifs from JASPAR v2018 ( Khan et al., 2018 39. Khan, A. ∙ Fornes, O. ∙ Stigliani, A. ... JASPAR 2018: update of the open-access database of transcription factor binding profiles and its web framework Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46 :D260-D266 Crossref Scopus (568) PubMed Google Scholar ) and known motifs from HOMER (V4.10) ( Heinz et al., 2010 29. Heinz, S. ∙ Benner, C. ∙ Spann, N. ... Simple combinations of lineage-determining transcription factors prime cis-regulatory elements required for macrophage and B cell identities Mol. Cell. 2010; 38 :576-589 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (4333) PubMed Google Scholar ). Sequences in the ATAC-Seq peaks or the DNase peaks were input for HOMER package motif finder algorithm findMotifGenome.pl. We used a random set of background regions chosen by HOMER. For the occurrence of motif, we used the FIMO (V5.0.2) ( Grant et al., 2011 22. Grant, C.E. ∙ Bailey, T.L. ∙ Noble, W.S. FIMO: scanning for occurrences of a given motif Bioinformatics. 2011; 27 :1017-1018 Crossref Scopus (1382) PubMed Google Scholar ) with P value cutoff 10 -4 .
We detected community as described in the previous report ( Phanstiel et al., 2017 71. Phanstiel, D.H. ∙ Van Bortle, K. ∙ Spacek, D. ... Static and Dynamic DNA Loops form AP-1-Bound Activation Hubs during Macrophage Development Mol. Cell. 2017; 67 :1037-1048.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (85) PubMed Google Scholar ). A non-directed network was generated from Hi-C interactions using igraph package (V1.2.4). Loop anchors were defined as nodes, and loops as edges. Community was detected by fastgreedy.community function from igraph with default settings. Protein-protein interaction network (STRING) community was detected in the same way.
We used mid-gestational human neocortical laminar gene expression data from the published study ( Miller et al., 2014 62. Miller, J.A. ∙ Ding, S.L. ∙ Sunkin, S.M. ... Transcriptional landscape of the prenatal human brain Nature. 2014; 508 :199-206 Crossref Scopus (550) PubMed Google Scholar ) to do lamina-specific and module-specific analysis. Lamina specificity was quantified as described in the previous study ( Parikshak et al., 2013 69. Parikshak, N.N. ∙ Luo, R. ∙ Zhang, A. ... Integrative functional genomic analyses implicate specific molecular pathways and circuits in autism Cell. 2013; 155 :1008-1021 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (523) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, specific expression of genes in a lamina was against to all other laminae, and t values of each gene per lamina were generated to quantify the expression specificity. Given a set of genes (such as all target genes regulated by HSLs), we quantified the skew of t value sets using whole genome genes as the background. We got z-scores and corresponding P values. We quantified module-specificity of a set of genes for 42 modules detected in the previous study ( Miller et al., 2014 62. Miller, J.A. ∙ Ding, S.L. ∙ Sunkin, S.M. ... Transcriptional landscape of the prenatal human brain Nature. 2014; 508 :199-206 Crossref Scopus (550) PubMed Google Scholar ). We assigned enrichment of a set of genes by permutation test. We randomly selected the same number as given gene sets 10,000 times. Then the numbers of the overlapped genes between randomly selected genes sets and genes in modules were used as background.
We evaluated the enrichment of the human-specific single nucleotide changes (SNCs) (determined by inter-species whole genome alignments, downloaded from the http://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/data_files/homo_sapiens/GRCh37/compara/ ) at the TFs binding motifs. First, we defined the TF set with HSL-binding preference and the TF set without binding preference compared to the conserved loops (using -log10 P Value (H-S - Cons) = 10 and ± 2 as thresholds respectively). Then we calculated the SNC-containing ratio per TFs and compared with the randomly selected regions (TFs with fewer than 5 SNC-containing motif instances were filtered out). The enrichments were evaluated by Fisher’s exact test, and P values were adjusted using the Benjamini & Hochberg method. About 65% (11 out of 17) of these TFs with HSL-binding preference are significantly enriched of the human-specific SNCs (FDR < 0.001).
For transcription factors showing differential enrichment between open chromatin regions of HSLs and ConsLs (NFIX, NFIA, NFIC, BHLHA15, TBR1, ATOH1, NR2E3, TCF4, OLIG2, NEUROG1, NEUROG2, EOMES and TGIF1), we predicted their putative target genes and generated TF-gene regulatory networks. First, we calculated Pearson correlation of TF-gene pairs using human fetal brain laminar gene expression data ( Miller et al., 2014 62. Miller, J.A. ∙ Ding, S.L. ∙ Sunkin, S.M. ... Transcriptional landscape of the prenatal human brain Nature. 2014; 508 :199-206 Crossref Scopus (550) PubMed Google Scholar ) per TF. We selected the genes with the top 1,000 most significant Pearson correlations. Then we filtered out genes of which promoter contains at least one binding site for the corresponding TF. We generated TF-gene regulatory networks using igraph package (V1.2.4). Nodes are TFs and putative target genes, and edges are Pearson correlations.
Images were acquired by a LEICA TCS SP8 confocal microscope with 63 × objective and 2.5 × Zoom factor. Images were obtained at 1,024 × 1,024 pixels with a scan speed of 600 Hz, frame average with 3, Z size with 0.33 μm and 25 Z-slices were taken. All the images were acquired under the same parameters. Image analysis was performed using imageJ ( Schindelin et al., 2012 80. Schindelin, J. ∙ Arganda-Carreras, I. ∙ Frise, E. ... Fiji: an open-source platform for biological-image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :676-682 Crossref Scopus (18835) PubMed Google Scholar ). The centroid positions in xyz were calculated by “3D Object Counter” plug-in with manually curated threshold per channels. Euclidean distances between each channel pairs were calculated.
We identified syntenic blocks between human and two other species (mouse and macaque) using Inferring Contiguous Ancestral Regions (inferCars) ( Ma et al., 2006 59. Ma, J. ∙ Zhang, L. ∙ Suh, B.B. ... Reconstructing contiguous regions of an ancestral genome Genome Res. 2006; 16 :1557-1565 Crossref Scopus (210) PubMed Google Scholar ) with the default settings. These blocks represent syntenic genomic regions across-species and the left part of the genome is considered as the non-syntenic regions. If the entire region of a TAD or loop is contained in a syntenic block, we consider it to be syntenic across species. For comparison, we define TADs and loops that span different syntenic blocks or fall in the junction areas of two adjacent syntenic blocks as non-syntenic 3D chromatin features. We also divide the non-syntenic human TADs and loops into 6 categories, including indel, translocation, inversion, large gap, interchromosomal recombination and other type according to the formation mechanisms of the related non-syntenic regions.
