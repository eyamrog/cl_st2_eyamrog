Title: Structural Basis of Human KCNQ1 Modulation and Gating


Abstract: Summary

KCNQ1, also known as Kv7.1, is a voltage-dependent K + channel that regulates gastric acid secretion, salt and glucose homeostasis, and heart rhythm. Its functional properties are regulated in a tissue-specific manner through co-assembly with beta subunits KCNE1–5. In non-excitable cells, KCNQ1 forms a complex with KCNE3, which suppresses channel closure at negative membrane voltages that otherwise would close it. Pore opening is regulated by the signaling lipid PIP2. Using cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM), we show that KCNE3 tucks its single-membrane-spanning helix against KCNQ1, at a location that appears to lock the voltage sensor in its depolarized conformation. Without PIP2, the pore remains closed. Upon addition, PIP2 occupies a site on KCNQ1 within the inner membrane leaflet, which triggers a large conformational change that leads to dilation of the pore’s gate. It is likely that this mechanism of PIP2 activation is conserved among Kv7 channels.

KCNQ1 (also known as Kv7.1 or KvLQT1) is widely distributed throughout different organs such as heart ( Barhanin et al., 1996; Sanguinetti et al., 1996 5.

KCNQ1 is the pore-forming subunit of the slow-delayed rectifier potassium channel ( I Ks ) in the human heart and therefore is vital for maintaining cardiac rhythm ( Barhanin et al., 1996; Sanguinetti et al., 1996 5.

KCNQ1—in complex with KCNE3—provides the driving force for proximal tubular and intestinal sodium absorption, gastric acid secretion, and intestinal cAMP-induced chloride secretion ( Al-Hazza et al., 2016; Julio-Kalajzić et al., 2018; Nakano and Shimizu, 2016; Preston et al., 2010 3.

Mutations in the kcnq1 gene or pharmacological disruption of KCNQ1 channel function cause human diseases such as long-QT syndrome, short-QT syndrome, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus, and deafness ( Nakano and Shimizu, 2016; Peroz et al., 2008; Thévenod, 2002 43.

KCNEs (KCNE1–5, also called minK-related peptides, MiRPs) are single-transmembrane-spanning beta subunits of potassium channels that modulate KCNQ1 functional properties and cellular localization ( Abbott et al., 2014; McCrossan and Abbott, 2004; Roura-Ferrer et al., 2010 1.

Impact of KCNE subunits on KCNQ1 (Kv7.1) channel membrane surface targeting J. Cell. Physiol. 2010; 225 :692-700 Crossref Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ). To fulfill its diverse roles in both excitable and nonexcitable cells, KCNQ1 is always found in association with one or more KCNE subunits in vivo . All five KCNE subunits can interact with KCNQ1, resulting in channel complexes with a wide range of functional properties ( Van Horn et al., 2011 68. Van Horn, W.D. ∙ Vanoye, C.G. ∙ Sanders, C.R. Working model for the structural basis for KCNE1 modulation of the KCNQ1 potassium channel Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2011; 21 :283-291 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ). For example, KCNE1 right-shifts the voltage dependence of KCNQ1 activation (that is, causes the channel to activate at more positive voltages), slows its activation and deactivation, increases the single-channel conductance, and eliminates inactivation. KCNE4 on the other hand is an inhibitor of KCNQ1 activity ( Grunnet et al., 2002 22. Grunnet, M. ∙ Jespersen, T. ∙ Rasmussen, H.B. ... KCNE4 is an inhibitory subunit to the KCNQ1 channel J. Physiol. 2002; 542 :119-130 Crossref Scopus (139) PubMed Google Scholar ).
KCNE3 alters the voltage sensitivity of KCNQ1 such that the current-voltage (I-V) relationship is almost linear over physiological membrane potentials ( Barro-Soria et al., 2015; Schroeder et al., 2000 6. Barro-Soria, R. ∙ Perez, M.E. ∙ Larsson, H.P. KCNE3 acts by promoting voltage sensor activation in KCNQ1 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112 :E7286-E7292 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar 56. Schroeder, B.C. ∙ Waldegger, S. ∙ Fehr, S. ... A constitutively open potassium channel formed by KCNQ1 and KCNE3 Nature. 2000; 403 :196-199 Crossref Scopus (436) PubMed Google Scholar ). A linear I-V relationship contrasts the more typical non-linear, step function-like I-V curve exhibited by most other Kv channels, including KCNQ1 in the absence of KCNE3. Linearity of the KCNQ1-KCNE3 I-V curve gives rise to K + conductivity in non-excitable cells such as polarized epithelial cells of the colon, small intestine, and airways. KCNE3 is thought to stabilize the S4 segment of KCNQ1 voltage sensors in an activated state, which in turn locks the channel open at negative voltages that would otherwise cause it to close ( Barro-Soria et al., 2015, 2017 6. Barro-Soria, R. ∙ Perez, M.E. ∙ Larsson, H.P. KCNE3 acts by promoting voltage sensor activation in KCNQ1 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112 :E7286-E7292 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar 7. Barro-Soria, R. ∙ Ramentol, R. ∙ Liin, S.I. ... KCNE1 and KCNE3 modulate KCNQ1 channels by affecting different gating transitions Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :E7367-E7376 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, a plausible mechanism has been proposed, suggesting that D54 and D55 of KCNE3 stabilize the KCNQ1 S4 in its activated conformation through electrostatic interactions with arginines on S4 ( Barro-Soria et al., 2015; Choi and Abbott, 2010 6. Barro-Soria, R. ∙ Perez, M.E. ∙ Larsson, H.P. KCNE3 acts by promoting voltage sensor activation in KCNQ1 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112 :E7286-E7292 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar 12. Choi, E. ∙ Abbott, G.W. A shared mechanism for lipid- and beta-subunit-coordinated stabilization of the activated K+ channel voltage sensor FASEB J. 2010; 24 :1518-1524 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, a concrete structural description of how KCNE3 does this is still missing.
The channel activity of KCNQ1 is also regulated by the signaling lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) ( Loussouarn et al., 2003 33. Loussouarn, G. ∙ Park, K.H. ∙ Bellocq, C. ... Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate, PIP2, controls KCNQ1/KCNE1 voltage-gated potassium channels: a functional homology between voltage-gated and inward rectifier K+ channels EMBO J. 2003; 22 :5412-5421 Crossref Scopus (181) PubMed Google Scholar ). PIP2 functions as a co-factor of KCNQ1 and is required for the activation of KCNQ1 homo-tetramers as well as its complexes with different KCNEs ( Zaydman and Cui, 2014 73. Zaydman, M.A. ∙ Cui, J. PIP2 regulation of KCNQ channels: biophysical and molecular mechanisms for lipid modulation of voltage-dependent gating Front. Physiol. 2014; 5 :195 Crossref Scopus (96) PubMed Google Scholar ). PIP2 likely acts by coupling the voltage sensor domain to the pore domain of KCNQ1 because in the absence of PIP2, the voltage sensors move, but the pore does not open ( Zaydman et al., 2013 74. Zaydman, M.A. ∙ Silva, J.R. ∙ Delaloye, K. ... Kv7.1 ion channels require a lipid to couple voltage sensing to pore opening Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110 :13180-13185 Crossref Scopus (146) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our previous structural study offered a hypothesis for the site of PIP2 binding ( Sun and MacKinnon, 2017 61. Sun, J. ∙ MacKinnon, R. Cryo-EM Structure of a KCNQ1/CaM Complex Reveals Insights into Congenital Long QT Syndrome Cell. 2017; 169 :1042-1050 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (229) PubMed Google Scholar ). Now we test this hypothesis and in addition describe the conformational changes that ensue once PIP2 binds.

Section: Results and Discussion

We first carried out structural studies of the “PIP2-free” hKCNQ1 EM -KCNE3 complex together with calmodulin (CaM), which is likely a structurally obligate subunit of KCNQ1 ( Ghosh et al., 2006; Sachyani et al., 2014; Shamgar et al., 2006 19. Ghosh, S. ∙ Nunziato, D.A. ∙ Pitt, G.S. KCNQ1 assembly and function is blocked by long-QT syndrome mutations that disrupt interaction with calmodulin Circ.

Res. 2006; 98 :1055-1063 Crossref Scopus (171) PubMed Google Scholar ). The N-terminal and C-terminal loops of human KCNQ1 were truncated to obtain a biochemically stable construct (hereafter called hKCNQ1 EM ). Full-length KCNE3 was tagged with mCherry fluorescence protein at its N terminus to monitor the intactness of the protein complex during purification. CaM was also overexpressed, although endogenous CaM from the HEK293S GnTl – cells used for protein expression may already be sufficient ( Figure S1 A; Goehring et al., 2014 20.

Protoc. 2014; 9 :2574-2585 Crossref Scopus (433) PubMed Google Scholar ). The resulting hKCNQ1 EM -KCNE3-CaM complex has an almost linear activation curve in electrophysiological recordings from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, manifesting functional features similar to those described in previous reports ( Gao et al., 2008; Kroncke et al., 2016; Mazhari et al., 2002; Van Horn et al., 2011 18.

Biol. 2011; 21 :283-291 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 1 A).
The structure of the “PIP2-free” hKCNQ1 EM -KCNE3-CaM complex was determined at a resolution of 3.1 Å using single-particle cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) analysis with C4 symmetry imposed ( Figures S1 B–S1D; Table S1 ). Structural studies were carried out in the presence of 4 mM EGTA. The final cryo-EM map allowed de novo model building ( Figures 1 B and 1C). In the presence of KCNE3, the architecture of human KCNQ1-CaM is similar to that of the Xenopus complex ( Sun and MacKinnon, 2017 61. Sun, J. ∙ MacKinnon, R. Cryo-EM Structure of a KCNQ1/CaM Complex Reveals Insights into Congenital Long QT Syndrome Cell. 2017; 169 :1042-1050 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (229) PubMed Google Scholar ), and thus we use the same nomenclature for secondary structure elements ( Figure S2 A). The channel complex has dimensions ∼70 Å × 70 Å × 110 Å ( Figure 1 C). KCNQ1 adopts a “decoupled” configuration with activated voltage sensors and a closed pore as expected in the absence of PIP2. The interface between KCNQ1 and CaM is conserved between the two species ( Figure S2 C). The overall RMSD between the human and Xenopus KCNQ1-CaM monomer is about 1.1 Å ( Figure S2 B).
The cryo-EM density permitted building of a model of KCNE3 that included the transmembrane helix, a cytosolic helix, and the connecting loop (amino acids 53–99). The remainder of KCNE3 was not resolved, presumably owing to structural disorder; the cryo-EM density of the cytoplasmic helix is weaker than that of the transmembrane helix. Of note, the structural model of KCNE3 in the complex deviates from an NMR structure of KCNE3 in the absence of KCNQ1 with an RMSD between the two structures of 7.6 Å ( Figure S2 F; Kroncke et al., 2016 30. Kroncke, B.M. ∙ Van Horn, W.D. ∙ Smith, J. ... Structural basis for KCNE3 modulation of potassium recycling in epithelia Sci. Adv. 2016; 2 :e1501228 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ). The structural differences undoubtedly reflect the separate contexts in which these structures were determined, one by itself and the other in a complex with the channel.
Four KCNE3 molecules are bound to one KCNQ1 tetramer. The number of KCNE subunits that can associate with the KCNQ1 tetramer has been debated ( Chen et al., 2003; Morin and Kobertz, 2008; Murray et al., 2016; Nakajo et al., 2010; Plant et al., 2014 11.

Unnatural amino acid photo-crosslinking of the IKs channel complex demonstrates a KCNE1:KCNQ1 stoichiometry of up to 4:4 Elife. 2016; 5 :e11815 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar 42.

Plant, L.D. ∙ Xiong, D. ∙ Dai, H. ... Individual IKs channels at the surface of mammalian cells contain two KCNE1 accessory subunits Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111 :1438-1446 Crossref Scopus (69) PubMed Google Scholar ). Previous investigations into the stoichiometry between KCNQ1 and KCNE1 (a paralog of KCNE3) have proposed either a fixed KCNQ1:KCNE1 stoichiometry of 4:2 or the possibility of multiple stoichiometries ranging from 4:1 to 4:4. During the structural reconstruction of the hKCNQ1 EM -KCNE3-CaM complex, we carried out 3D refinement without imposing symmetry restraints; the results support a 4:4 stoichiometry ( Figure S1 B), thus demonstrating that a 4:4 stoichiometry can occur.
To document the influence of KCNE3 on the structure of KCNQ1, we also determined the cryo-EM structure of hKCNQ1 EM -CaM in the absence of KCNE3 at a resolution of 3.1 Å ( Figure S3 ; Table S1 ). When aligning the pore domain of these two structures, we observe an ∼7-degree counterclockwise rotation of the voltage sensors relative to the pore in the KCNE3-bound complex, when viewed from the extracellular side ( Figure S2 E). This rotation moves the voltage sensor domains of KCNQ1 slightly away from the pore domain, allowing space for the KCNE3 subunits.
The interface between KCNE3 and KCNQ1-CaM consists of two parts: cytosolic interactions between KCNE3 and CaM ( Figure S2 D) and transmembrane interactions between KCNE3 and KCNQ1 ( Figure 2 A). At the cytosolic interface, KCNE3 lies on the top of a surface shaped by two neighboring CaM subunits ( Figure S2 D). At the transmembrane interface, KCNE3 is tucked into a cleft formed by three KCNQ1 subunits. The mainly hydrophobic surface of this cleft is lined by S6 from one subunit, S5 and the pore helix from a second subunit, and S1 and S4 from a third subunit ( Figure 2 B). The extracellular half of KCNE3 lies in between S1 and S6, consistent with previous biochemical data showing that residues flanking the extracellular end of the KCNE1 transmembrane helix could be crosslinked to S1 and S6 of KCNQ1 by introducing disulfide bonds ( Figure S2 G). Therefore, we expect that KCNE1 and KCNE3 occupy a similar location in the complex. We note, however, that some homologous residue pairs that could be strongly crosslinked in a previous study are quite far away in the hKCNQ1 EM -KCNE3-CaM complex ( Chung et al., 2009 14. Chung, D.Y. ∙ Chan, P.J. ∙ Bankston, J.R. ... Location of KCNE1 relative to KCNQ1 in the I(KS) potassium channel by disulfide cross-linking of substituted cysteines Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106 :743-748 Crossref Scopus (68) PubMed Google Scholar ). While it is possible that KCNE1 and KCNE3 can bind differently to KCNQ1, we think it is also likely that crosslinks sometimes occur between distant residues ( Figure S2 G).
The position of KCNE3 suggests a plausible explanation for why it prevents closure of KCNQ1 at negative voltages, thus rendering the I-V relation approximately linear. We observe that KCNE3 directly contacts the bottom of S4 when the voltage sensor adopts its up (depolarized) conformation ( Figure 2 C). If the contact stabilizes S4 in this conformation, then it would diminish the tendency for S4 to move downward toward the cytoplasm at hyperpolarizing membrane voltages. Likewise, the position of KCNE3 might destabilize S4 in its downward conformation. In either case, KCNE3 seems well poised to favor a depolarized conformation of the voltage sensor. This explanation is consistent with a voltage-clamp fluorometry study, which showed that KCNE3 primarily affects the movement of S4 to modify the voltage-dependent gating of KCNQ1 ( Barro-Soria et al., 2015 6. Barro-Soria, R. ∙ Perez, M.E. ∙ Larsson, H.P. KCNE3 acts by promoting voltage sensor activation in KCNQ1 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112 :E7286-E7292 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the molecular details of the locking mechanism we describe are distinct from an earlier model, in which D54 and D55 of KCNE3 were proposed to interact with R228 or R237 on S4 ( Barro-Soria et al., 2015; Choi and Abbott, 2010 6. Barro-Soria, R. ∙ Perez, M.E. ∙ Larsson, H.P. KCNE3 acts by promoting voltage sensor activation in KCNQ1 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112 :E7286-E7292 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar 12. Choi, E. ∙ Abbott, G.W. A shared mechanism for lipid- and beta-subunit-coordinated stabilization of the activated K+ channel voltage sensor FASEB J. 2010; 24 :1518-1524 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the structure, we observe that distances between D54 and R228 of 19.7 Å, between D55 and R228 of 27.4 Å, between D54 and R237 of 25.6 Å, and between D55 and R237 of 30.6 Å are too great to mediate the proposed electrostatic interactions.
Melman and colleagues showed that it is possible to modify KCNE3 so that its influence on KCNQ1 gating is similar to that of KCNE1 ( Melman et al., 2001, 2002 38. Melman, Y.F. ∙ Domènech, A. ∙ de la Luna, S. ... Structural determinants of KvLQT1 control by the KCNE family of proteins J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276 :6439-6444 Crossref Scopus (97) PubMed Google Scholar 39. Melman, Y.F. ∙ Krummerman, A. ∙ McDonald, T.V. KCNE regulation of KvLQT1 channels: structure-function correlates Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2002; 12 :182-187 Crossref Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ). The modification they made was mutation of amino acids Thr71, Val72, and Gly73 to the corresponding amino acids—Phe, Thr, and Leu—found in KCNE1. In the structure, these amino acids reside deep inside the membrane, where KCNE3 interacts with helices S1, S4, and S5 ( Figure 2 E). How this segment of the KCNE transmembrane helix confers specific gating properties onto KCNQ1 is unclear.
Because KCNE3 modifies KCNQ1 such that voltage-dependent closure does not occur across the physiological range of voltages, the KCNQ1-KCNE3-CaM channel essentially functions as a ligand-gated ion channel, with the ligand being the signaling lipid PIP2. To demonstrate PIP2 activation of hKCNQ1 EM -KCNE3-CaM, we used a liposome flux assay ( Su et al., 2016 60. Su, Z. ∙ Brown, E.C. ∙ Wang, W. ... Novel cell-free high-throughput screening method for pharmacological tools targeting K+ channels Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113 :5748-5753 Crossref Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ). Proteoliposomes were reconstituted with a high concentration of K + (160 mM KCl) and then diluted into K + -free solution with ionic strength held constant with 160 mM NaCl. Fluorescence decrease due to K + efflux was observed only when both hKCNQ1 EM -KCNE3-CaM and PIP2 were present in the vesicles, indicating that the purified channel complex is activated by PIP2 in vitro ( Figure 3 A).
We determined a cryo-EM structure of hKCNQ1 EM -KCNE3-CaM with PIP2 in nanodiscs at an overall resolution of 3.9 Å ( Figures 3 C and S4 ; Table S1 ; Denisov and Sligar, 2016; Nath et al., 2007 15.

Applications of phospholipid bilayer nanodiscs in the study of membranes and membrane proteins Biochemistry. 2007; 46 :2059-2069 Crossref Scopus (371) PubMed Google Scholar ). hKCNQ1 EM -KCNE3-CaM was first purified in detergent and then reconstituted into lipid nanodiscs containing soybean polar extract and brain PIP2 ( Figure 3 B). Following data collection and image analysis, the map showed the highest-quality density in the transmembrane domain and in cytoplasmic helices HA and HB, allowing side-chain assignment in these regions. Because the density in most other areas, including the CaM N-lobe, was too poor to ensure accurate sequence registration, we initiated model building by docking the model of the PIP2-free structure into the map. It was immediately evident that the PIP2-bound hKCNQ1 EM -KCNE3-CaM channel exhibited large conformational changes relative to the PIP2 structure ( Figures 1 B and 3 C).
Density consistent with PIP2 is observed near a loop that connects S4 to the S4-S5 linker of KCNQ1 ( Figure 4 B). The binding site contains multiple amino acids with positive-charged side chains contributed by S0, the S2-S3 loop, and the S4-S5 linker of KCNQ1, and possibly more distant interactions with amino acids from KCNE3 ( Figures 4 A and 4C). The location of PIP2 binding is consistent with biochemical and mutational studies that concluded PIP2 interacts with these same regions ( Choveau et al., 2018; Eckey et al., 2014; Kasimova et al., 2015; Telezhkin et al., 2013; Zaydman et al., 2013 13.

Several studies implicated also the importance of the junction between S6 and the HA helix, the HB helix, and the linker connecting these helices of KCNQ1 ( Choveau et al., 2018; Tobelaim et al., 2017; Zaydman et al., 2013 13.

USA. 2013; 110 :13180-13185 Crossref Scopus (146) PubMed Google Scholar ). The residues at the junction between S6 and HA may be important for the PIP2-induced conformational changes discussed below. However, the sites on HB or the linker connecting the HA and HB helices are not easily explained by our cryo-EM structure. KCNE3 also comes in close proximity to PIP2, suggesting that it might influence PIP2 regulation ( Li et al., 2011 32. Li, Y. ∙ Zaydman, M.A. ∙ Wu, D. ... KCNE1 enhances phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) sensitivity of IKs to modulate channel activity Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108 :9095-9100 Crossref Scopus (91) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The binding of PIP2 leads to large conformational changes in KCNQ1 ( Figure 5 ). The S6 and HA helices, which form a helix-loop-helix structure in the “PIP2-free” state, become a single continuous long helix ( Figure 5 A). This transition causes CaM to rotate almost 180 degrees, release its interaction with the voltage sensor, and move toward the central axis of the molecule. The linker connecting S6 to the HA helices (here called the “RQKH motif”) undergoes a structural rearrangement from a loop to a helix. The RQKH motif is absolutely conserved in sequence among KCNQ1 orthologs and paralogs (KCNQ1–5) ( Figure S5 E), suggesting the possibility of a similar PIP2-gating mechanism for the entire KCNQ family.
Correlated with the above conformational changes, the C-terminal half of S6 bends at the conserved “PAG” segment in the presence of PIP2, which has been identified as an important gating element ( Figure 5 B; Boulet et al., 2007; Seebohm et al., 2007 8. Boulet, I.R. ∙ Labro, A.J. ∙ Raes, A.L. ... Role of the S6 C-terminus in KCNQ1 channel gating J. Physiol. 2007; 585 :325-337 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar 57.

The bend causes the cytoplasmic pore entrance to dilate ( Figure 5 C). The region near Ser349, proposed to form the inner gate, expands from ∼1 Å to >3.5 Å ( Figure 5 C; Sun and MacKinnon, 2017 61.

Similar opening mechanisms through bending of S6 have also been observed in other channels ( Hite and MacKinnon, 2017; Hite et al., 2017; Lee and MacKinnon, 2018 24. Hite, R.K. ∙ MacKinnon, R.

Activation mechanism of a human SK-calmodulin channel complex elucidated by cryo-EM structures Science. 2018; 360 :508-513 Crossref Scopus (130) PubMed Google Scholar ). The narrowest region of the ion-conducting pathway remains ∼2.5 Å radius. Since a hydrated K + ion is larger than that (radius ∼4 Å), we are left to wonder whether the pore can dilate further or whether K + can diffuse across this region because the side chains are sufficiently dynamic. This situation of “a little narrower than expected” has occurred so repeatedly in various ion channels under conditions that should render conductivity that we wonder whether the diffusion of ions through a sufficiently dynamic region is analogous to the diffusion of molecular oxygen to heme in hemoglobin ( Hansen et al., 2011; Lee and MacKinnon, 2018; Park and MacKinnon, 2018; Perutz and Mathews, 1966; Takayanagi et al., 2013; Whorton and MacKinnon, 2013 23.

Because we determined the PIP2-free structure in detergent micelles (digitonin) and the PIP2-bound structure in nanodiscs, we repeated the structural comparison under conditions in which the only difference is the presence or absence of PIP2. To this end, we determined the structure of hKCNQ1 EM -KCNE3-CaM in nanodiscs without PIP2 at a resolution of 6.2 Å. The “PIP2-free” hKCNQ1 EM -KCNE3-CaM model docks almost perfectly into the map ( Figure S5 A). Thus, PIP2 drives the conformational change. We also examined the effects of PIP2 on KCNQ1 in the absence of KCNE3 and found that it produced the same conformational change ( Figure S5 B). To better appreciate the magnitude of conformational changes caused by the binding of PIP2, we made movies connecting the PIP2-free and PIP2-bound structures of the hKCNQ1 EM -KCNE3-CaM complex ( Video S1 and S2 ).

Pore Dilation of the KCNQ1 Channel Induced by PIP2, Related to Figure 5
The PIP2-mediated conformational change helps to rationalize the functional effects of certain disease-causing mutations, for example, R555H ( Figure S5 D). R555 is located on the HC helix of KCNQ1, which interacts with the CaM C-lobe in the PIP2-bound state. In cellular electrophysiological studies, this mutant channel exhibits markedly reduced I Ks current without altering channel trafficking ( Aromolaran et al., 2014 4. Aromolaran, A.S. ∙ Subramanyam, P. ∙ Chang, D.D. ... LQT1 mutations in KCNQ1 C-terminus assembly domain suppress IKs using different mechanisms Cardiovasc. Res. 2014; 104 :501-511 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ). The structures suggest that R555H might disrupt interactions between HC and CaM that are important for stabilization of the open KCNQ1-KCNE1 complex. The reduced channel activity then leads to a long-QT syndrome.
KCNQ1 is a voltage-dependent K + channel of physiological importance. In non-excitable cells, it forms a complex with KCNE3 that suppresses channel closure at negative membrane voltages that otherwise would close it. Conductivity of the pore is largely regulated by the signaling lipid PIP2: in the absence of PIP2 the channel closes and in its presence it opens. This paper addresses two central questions. First, how does KCNE3 prevent voltage-dependent closure of KCNQ1? And second, how does PIP2 open the KCNQ1-KCNE3-CaM complex? The answer to the first question is KCNE3 tucks its single-membrane-spanning helix against KCNQ1 in such a way that it appears to stabilize the up conformation of the voltage sensor, locking it in its “open” configuration. The answer to the second question is binding of PIP2 orchestrates global conformational changes that open the pore. The PIP2 binding site involves S0, the S2-S3 loop, the S4-S5 linker of KCNQ1, and possibly the juxtamembrane region of KCNE3. Through its interaction with these regions, PIP2 brings about a large conformational change in the cytoplasmic domain and opening of the ion-conducting pathway through expansion of the S6 helices.

Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 cells were cultured in DMEM/F-12 medium (GIBCO) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37°C. Sf9 cells were cultured in Sf-900 II SFM medium (GIBCO) at 27°C. HEK293S GnTI - cells were cultured in Freestyle 293 medium supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum at 37°C.
DNAs encoding human KCNQ1 ( Homo sapiens : NP_000209.2), KCNE3 ( Homo sapiens : NP_005463) and CaM ( Homo sapiens : NP_001734.1) were synthesized by Genewiz. To improve the biochemical and thermal stability of KCNQ1, the N-terminal and C-terminal regions were truncated, leaving a construct (hKCNQ1 EM ) with residues 76-620. EcoR I and Xho I sites were used for cloning the hKCNQ1 EM construct into a BacMam expression vector with a C-terminal green fluorescent protein (GFP)-6xHis tag linked by a preScission protease site. Full-length KCNE3 ( Homo sapiens : NP_005463) was cloned into a BacMam expression vector with an IL2 signal peptide followed by a mCherry2 fluorescence protein tag. CaM was cloned into a BacMam expression vector without any tags ( Figure S1 A).
Recombinant baculoviruses of hKCNQ1 EM , KCNE3 and CaM were generated separately using the Bac-to-Bac system according to manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen). Then P3 virus mixture of hKCNQ1 EM :CaM (9:1) or hKCNQ1 EM :KCNE3:CaM (5:5:1) was used for transduction of HEK293S GnTI - cells for protein expression. Briefly, for 1L cultures of HEK293S GnTI - cells (1.5-3x10 6 cells/mL) in Freestyle 293 media (GIBCO) supplemented with 2% FBS (GIBCO), about 100 mL P3 virus mixture was used. Infected cells were incubated at 37°C overnight, and protein expression was induced by adding 10 mM sodium butyrate. Cells were cultured at 30°C for another 48-60 hr before harvest ( Goehring et al., 2014 20. Goehring, A. ∙ Lee, C.H. ∙ Wang, K.H. ... Screening and large-scale expression of membrane proteins in mammalian cells for structural studies Nat. Protoc. 2014; 9 :2574-2585 Crossref Scopus (433) PubMed Google Scholar ).
4L of cell pellet was resuspended in 75 mL lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES pH7.4, 150 mM KCl, 4 mM EGTA, 2 μM leupepetin, 1 μM pepstatin, 100 μM PMSF, 3 μM E-64 and 1 μg/mL aprotinin), and then solubilized by adding 70 mL detergent mixture LMNG/CHS (8:1 mass ratio, 2% stock solubilized in 20 mM HEPES pH7.4, 150 mM KCl) to a final concentration of 1% while stirring at 4°C for 2 hr. Solubilized hKCNQ1 EM -CaM or hKCNQ1 EM -KCNE3-CaM was separated from the insoluble fraction by high-speed centrifugation (38,000 g for 1 hr), and incubated with 4 mL CNBR-activated Sepharose beads (GE healthcare) coupled with 4 mg high-affinity GFP nanobodies (GFP-NB) ( Kirchhofer et al., 2010 29. Kirchhofer, A. ∙ Helma, J. ∙ Schmidthals, K. ... Modulation of protein properties in living cells using nanobodies Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17 :133-138 Crossref Scopus (422) PubMed Google Scholar ). The GFP tag was cleaved by preScission protease 2hr or overnight at 4°C, and hKCNQ1 EM -CaM or hKCNQ1 EM -KCNE3-CaM complex was further purified by size-exclusion chromatography with a Superose 6, 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 20 mM HEPES pH7.4, 150 mM KCl, 4 mM EGTA, 0.06% Digitonin. The peak fractions were pooled, concentrated to 5-6 mg/ml using a 100-kDa MWCO centrifugal device (Ambion) and immediately used for cryo-EM grid preparation.
To prepare the lipid stock, soybean polar lipid extract (Soy-PL, Avanti) or Soy-PL:brain PIP2 (Avanti) mixture (1:1 mass ratio) dissolved in chloroform was dried as a thin film in a glass tube using an argon stream. Next, the lipid film was solubilized in 20 mM HEPES pH 7.4 with 0.8% DDM/CHS mixture (DDM:CHS = 5:1), resulting in a final concentration of 10 mM lipid as calculated from the average molecular weight of the lipid species.
Protein complex was reconstituted with MSP2N2 and Soy-PL or mixture of Soy-PL and brain PIP2 in a final ratio of 1:3:450, which was prepared in the following manner ( Denisov and Sligar, 2016 15. Denisov, I.G. ∙ Sligar, S.G. Nanodiscs for structural and functional studies of membrane proteins Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2016; 23 :481-486 Crossref Scopus (352) PubMed Google Scholar ). hKCNQ1 EM -CaM or hKCNQ1 EM -KCNE3-CaM eluted from the GFP-NB column was mixed with the DDM-CHS solubilized lipid, which was incubated for 30min at 4 degree to form mixed lipid-detergent micelles. Next, MSP2N2 was added to the protein-lipid mixture for another 30min incubation before an equal volume of freshly activated bio-beads SM2 were added to remove the detergent from the system. The resulting mixture was incubated at 4°C overnight with constant rotation. Bio-beads were removed, and the reconstituted mixture was further purified using size-exclusion chromatography with a Superose 6, 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 20 mM HEPES pH7.4, 150 mM KCl and 4 mM EGTA. The peak fractions were pooled, concentrated to 5-6 mg/ml using a 100-kDa MWCO centrifugal device (Ambion). For cryo-EM grid preparation, the concentrated protein sample was mixed with 120 mM Fos-Choline-8 at a volume ratio of 1:50 immediately before freezing.
Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, cultured in DMEM-F12 (GIBCO) with 10% FBS and L-glutamine, were transfected with the hKCNQ1 EM and KCNE3 expression plasmid (1:2 mass ratio) with lipofectamine 3000 reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific). A medium exchange was carried out after 4hr incubation with lipofectamine reagent. 48 hr following transfection, the media was replaced with bath solution and experiments were performed at room temperature using whole-cell patch-clamp techniques with polished borosilicate glass pipettes with resistances between 2-4 MΩ. All recordings were carried out using pClamp10.5 software (Molecular Devices), an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices), and an Axon digidata 1550 digitizer (Molecular Devices). Data were filtered at 1 kHz and digitized at 10 kHz.
The bath solution contains 10 mM HEPES-Na pH 7.2, 20 mM KCl, 130 mM NaCl, 5 mM glucose, 2 mM MgCl 2 and 1 mM CaCl 2 , and the pipette solution was 10 mM HEPES-Na pH 7.2, 50 mM KF, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM EGTA. Data were processed using Origin 9 (OriginLab).
Lipid mixtures, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (POPE) and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-snglycero-3-phospho-(1’-rac-glycerol) (POPG) at a 3:1 ratio (w/w) or POPE, POPG and PI(4,5)P2 at a 3:1:0.1 ratio were dried under an argon stream, and placed in a vacuum chamber overnight. Dried lipids were suspended by sonication in buffer containing 20 mM Tris pH 8 and 160 mM KCl. DDM was added and mixed with the lipid suspension for 1 hour at room temperature. The final DDM concentration was 10 mM and the lipid concentration 10 mg/ml. Purified channel complex was added to the lipid/DDM mixture at a protein-to-lipid ratio of 1:250 (w/w). After 30-min incubation at room temperature, SM2 biobeads (Bio-Rad) were added to remove DDM by incubating the mixture at 4°C overnight.
Proteoliposome vesicles were collected, briefly sonicated and diluted 25 times in buffer containing 20 mM Tris pH 8 and 160 mM NaCl and prior to the assay. 6 μL vesicles was mixed with 6 μL ACMA solution (7.5 μM) and 12 μL buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8 and 160 mM NaCl). Fluorescence was recorded every 5 s (λE X = 410 nm, λE M = 490 nm) using a plate reader (Tecan Infinite M1000). After the ACMA fluorescence stabilized, K + flux was initiated by addition of 6 μL CCCP (40 μM). At the end of the assay, 2 μM valinomycin was added to release K + from all vesicles and yield a minimum baseline fluorescence.
Cryo-EM grids were prepared with a Vitrobot Mark IV (FEI). Quantifoil R1.2/1.3 holey carbon gold grids were glow-discharged for 15 s. Then 3.6 μL of 5-6 mg/ml protein sample was pipetted onto the grids, which were blotted for 2 s under blot force 1 at 100% humidity and frozen in liquid nitrogen cooled liquid ethane. The grids were loaded onto a 300 keV Titan Krios (FEI) with a K2 direct electron detector (Gatan).
Images of all datasets except the hKCNQ1 EM -KCNE3-CaM with PIP2 dataset were recorded with SerialEM ( Mastronarde, 2005 35. Mastronarde, D.N. Automated electron microscope tomography using robust prediction of specimen movements J Struct Biol. 2005; 152 :36-51 Crossref Scopus (3221) PubMed Google Scholar ) in super-resolution mode with a super resolution pixel size of 0.515 Å and a defocus range of -1.1 to -2.4 μm. Data were collected with a dose rate of 8 electrons per physical pixel per second, and images were recorded with a 12.5 s exposure and 250 ms subframes (50 total frames). The hKCNQ1 EM -KCNE3-CaM with PIP2 was collected on Krios #2 equipped with a Cs corrector, energy filter and K2 detector in Simons Electron Microscopy Center, NYSBC. Images were recorded in super-resolution mode with a super resolution pixel size of 0.545 Å and a defocus range of -1.1 to -2.2 μm. Dose rate is set at 8 electrons per physical pixel per second, and images were recorded with a 10 s exposure using 200 ms subframes.
Super-resolution image stacks were gain-normalized, binned by 2 with Fourier cropping, and corrected for beam-induced motion using MotionCor2 ( Zheng et al., 2017 77. Zheng, S.Q. ∙ Palovcak, E. ∙ Armache, J.P. ... MotionCor2: anisotropic correction of beam-induced motion for improved cryo-electron microscopy Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :331-332 Crossref Scopus (4520) PubMed Google Scholar ). Contrast transfer function parameters were estimated from motion-corrected summed images without dose-weighting using GCTF ( Zhang, 2016 75. Zhang, K. Gctf: Real-time CTF determination and correction J. Struct. Biol. 2016; 193 :1-12 Crossref Scopus (2392) PubMed Google Scholar ). All subsequent processing was performed on motion-corrected summed images with dose weighting. About 3,000 particles were manually picked and processed with reference-free 2D classification in RELION to generate a template ( Zivanov et al., 2018 78. Zivanov, J. ∙ Nakane, T. ∙ Forsberg, B.O. ... New tools for automated high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination in RELION-3 eLife. 2018; 7 Published online November 9, 2018 Crossref Scopus (2943) PubMed Google Scholar ), which was used for particle picking using Gautomatch (written by Kai Zhang). Auto-picked particles were visually examined to remove false positives and were further cleaned up by multiple rounds of 2D classification in cryoSPARC ( Punjani et al., 2017 51. Punjani, A. ∙ Rubinstein, J.L. ∙ Fleet, D.J. ... cryoSPARC: algorithms for rapid unsupervised cryo-EM structure determination Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :290-296 Crossref Scopus (4045) PubMed Google Scholar ).
For hKCNQ1 EM -CaM and hKCNQ1 EM -KCNE3-CaM datasets, ab initio reconstruction was carried out in cryoSPARC requesting three classes. The best class was further refined by cryoSPARC followed by local refinement in RELION. For the hKCNQ1 EM -KCNE3-CaM with PIP2 dataset, the best classes from cryoSPARC were refined in RELION followed by 3D classification without alignment, resulting in one class with continuous density for all transmembrane helices. Then, particles from the best class were used for Bayesion polishing ( Scheres, 2012 55. Scheres, S.H. RELION: implementation of a Bayesian approach to cryo-EM structure determination J. Struct. Biol. 2012; 180 :519-530 Crossref Scopus (3645) PubMed Google Scholar ) followed by another round of 2D classification, 3D refinement and 3D classification without alignment in RELION. Next, the classes with good densities were combined for 3D refinement.
Either RELION or auto_sharpen of the Phenix program ( Terwilliger et al., 2018 65. Terwilliger, T.C. ∙ Sobolev, O.V. ∙ Afonine, P.V. ... Automated map sharpening by maximization of detail and connectivity Acta Crystallogr. D Struct. Biol. 2018; 74 :545-559 Crossref Scopus (150) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used for map sharpening. Models were built in Coot ( Emsley et al., 2010 17. Emsley, P. ∙ Lohkamp, B. ∙ Scott, W.G. ... Features and development of Coot Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :486-501 Crossref Scopus (20218) PubMed Google Scholar ). First, a homology model was generated using the I-TASSER server ( Yang et al., 2015; Yang and Zhang, 2015 71. Yang, J. ∙ Zhang, Y. I-TASSER server: new development for protein structure and function predictions Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43 :W174-W181 Crossref Scopus (1758) PubMed Google Scholar 72. Yang, J. ∙ Yan, R. ∙ Roy, A. ... The I-TASSER Suite: protein structure and function prediction Nat. Methods. 2015; 12 :7-8 Crossref Scopus (4338) PubMed Google Scholar ) and docked into the cryo-EM map. From this starting point manual rebuilding was carried out. The structural model was refined using phenix.real_space_refine ( Afonine et al., 2013 2. Afonine, P.V. ∙ Grosse-Kunstleve, R.W. ∙ Adams, P.D. ... Bulk-solvent and overall scaling revisited: faster calculations, improved results Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2013; 69 :625-634 Crossref Scopus (72) PubMed Google Scholar ) with secondary structure restraints and Coot iteratively. Protein structure quality was monitored using the Molprobity server ( Chen et al., 2010 10. Chen, V.B. ∙ Arendall, 3rd, W.B. ∙ Headd, J.J. ... MolProbity: all-atom structure validation for macromolecular crystallography Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :12-21 Crossref Scopus (11100) PubMed Google Scholar ). The resulting hKCNQ1 EM -CaM structure includes KCNQ1 residues 104-218, 223-396 and 506-568 and CaM residues 6-149. The resulting hKCNQ1 EM -KCNE3-CaM structure includes KCNQ1 residues 104-218, 222-396 and 506-569, KCNE3 residues 53-99 and CaM residues 6-149. The structure of hKCNQ1 EM -KCNE3-CaM with PIP2 includes hKCNQ1 residues 104-218, 225-387, 506-537 and 542-562, KCNE3 residues 53-92 and CaM residues 6-149.The pore radii were calculated using HOLE ( Smart et al., 1996 59. Smart, O.S. ∙ Neduvelil, J.G. ∙ Wang, X. ... HOLE: a program for the analysis of the pore dimensions of ion channel structural models J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14 354–360, 376 Crossref Scopus (1260) PubMed Google Scholar ). Figures were prepared using PyMOL (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 2.0 Schrödinger, LLC.) and UCSF Chimera ( Pettersen et al., 2004 48. Pettersen, E.F. ∙ Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ... UCSF Chimera--a visualization system for exploratory research and analysis J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25 :1605-1612 Crossref Scopus (33472) PubMed Google Scholar ).
All reported resolutions in cryoEM studies are based upon the 0.143 Fourier Shell Correlation criterion. Error bars in Figure 3 A represent standard error of the mean for three independent experiments.
