Title: Adult neural stem cell activation in mice is regulated by the day/night cycle and intracellular calcium dynamics


Abstract: Summary

Neural stem cells (NSCs) in the adult brain transit from the quiescent state to proliferation to produce new neurons. The mechanisms regulating this transition in freely behaving animals are, however, poorly understood. We customized in vivo imaging protocols to follow NSCs for several days up to months, observing their activation kinetics in freely behaving mice. Strikingly, NSC division is more frequent during daylight and is inhibited by darkness-induced melatonin signaling. The inhibition of melatonin receptors affected intracellular Ca 2+ dynamics and promoted NSC activation. We further discovered a Ca 2+ signature of quiescent versus activated NSCs and showed that several microenvironmental signals converge on intracellular Ca 2+ pathways to regulate NSC quiescence and activation. In vivo NSC-specific optogenetic modulation of Ca 2+ fluxes to mimic quiescent-state-like Ca 2+ dynamics in freely behaving mice blocked NSC activation and maintained their quiescence, pointing to the regulatory mechanisms mediating NSC activation in freely behaving animals.

Section: Introduction

The adult mammalian brain has a remarkable capacity to produce new neurons that integrate into preexisting neuronal networks and that play a functional role in animal behavior ( Akers et al., 2014 1.

The role of adult-born neurons in the constantly changing olfactory bulb network Neural Plast. 2016; 2016 :1614329 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ). These neurons are derived from adult neural stem cells (NSCs), and several studies have demonstrated that the generation and survival of new neurons are regulated by a diverse set of physiological stimuli and behavioral states, including physical exercise, stress, novel environments, diet, and social and maternal interactions ( Obernier and Alvarez-Buylla, 2019 42.

It is, however, not known how the physiology of NSCs is influenced by different behavioral states in freely behaving mice that naturally explore their environment and undergo distinct behavioral-state-dependent changes. Live imaging of adult NSCs in zebrafish ( Barbosa et al., 2015 6. Barbosa, J.S. ∙ Sanchez-Gonzalez, R. ∙ Di Giaimo, R. ... Neurodevelopment. Live imaging of adult neural stem cell behavior in the intact and injured zebrafish brain Science. 2015; 348 :789-793 Crossref Scopus (143) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the murine dentate gyrus ( Pilz et al., 2018 46.

Live imaging of neurogenesis in the adult mouse hippocampus Science. 2018; 359 :658-662 Crossref Scopus (225) PubMed Google Scholar ) has provided profound new insights into their mode of division and their progeny. However, NSCs have so far only been examined in animals under anesthesia, which resembles a non-active, sleep-like state ( Brown et al., 2010 12. Brown, E.N. ∙ Lydic, R. ∙ Schiff, N.D. General anesthesia, sleep, and coma N. Engl. J. Med. 2010; 363 :2638-2650 Crossref Scopus (899) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lewis et al., 2018 34. Lewis, L.D. ∙ Piantoni, G. ∙ Peterfreund, R.A. ... A transient cortical state with sleep-like sensory responses precedes emergence from general anesthesia in humans eLife. 2018; 7 :7 Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar ) that affects the physiology of neurons and glia ( Hemmings et al., 2005 24. Hemmings, Jr., H.C. ∙ Akabas, M.H. ∙ Goldstein, P.A. ... Emerging molecular mechanisms of general anesthetic action Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2005; 26 :503-510 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (434) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kim et al., 2018 30. Kim, D. ∙ Kim, H.J. ∙ Ahn, S. Anesthetics mechanisms: a review of putative target proteins at the cellular and molecular level Curr. Drug Targets. 2018; 19 :1333-1343 Crossref Scopus (6) PubMed Google Scholar ). We also know very little about the influence of the day/night cycle on NSC activity in vivo .
We thus developed a minimally invasive advanced technology that makes it possible to image NSCs in freely behaving mice for up to 2 months. Since the subventricular zone (SVZ) bordering the lateral ventricle contains the largest population of NSCs in the adult brain ( Obernier and Alvarez-Buylla, 2019 42. Obernier, K. ∙ Alvarez-Buylla, A. Neural stem cells: origin, heterogeneity and regulation in the adult mammalian brain Development. 2019; 146 :dev156059 Crossref Scopus (336) PubMed Google Scholar ), we installed mini-endoscopes in the lateral ventricle to perform side-view imaging of NSCs in the intact SVZ. We also used two-color mini-endoscopic imaging allowing to monitor NSCs identified by the activity of the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and prominin (P2) promoters ( Beckervordersandforth et al., 2010 7. Beckervordersandforth, R. ∙ Tripathi, P. ∙ Ninkovic, J. ...

Codega, P. ∙ Silva-Vargas, V. ∙ Paul, A. ... Prospective identification and purification of quiescent adult neural stem cells from their in vivo niche Neuron. 2014; 82 :545-559 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (460) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our in vivo imaging approaches revealed that the dynamics of NSC activation are regulated by day/night cycle, with a higher propensity for division during the day. This regulation was dependent on day/night changes in melatonin levels. Altering melatonin signaling either pharmacologically or by keeping the mice in constant light or constant darkness for 3 or 7 days modified the number of proliferative NSCs.
We then explored Ca 2+ dynamics in NSCs as a possible mechanism for integrating and decoding the multiple signals impinging on NSCs. This revealed striking differences in the dynamics and steady-state intracellular levels of Ca 2+ between the quiescent and proliferative states of NSCs and showed that several microenvironmental signals converge on intracellular Ca 2+ to regulate NSC activation and the transition from the quiescent to the proliferative state. Importantly, blocking melatonin receptors also affected these characteristic differences, and in vivo optogenetic manipulation of Ca 2+ fluxes into NSCs to mimic the Ca 2+ dynamics of the quiescent state blocked the transition of NSCs to the proliferative state. NSC division in freely behaving mice is thus regulated by the day/night cycle and is dependent on intracellular Ca 2+ dynamics, a key integrator of signals that regulate NSC activation versus quiescence.

Section: Results

To label adult NSCs in vivo and then follow their dynamics by live imaging, we electroporated CMV-GFP plasmids into the SVZ of postnatal day (P)0 to P1 CD1 pups (or CMV-RFP plasmids into GFAP-GFP pups) and analyzed label-retaining cells in adulthood ( Figure 1 A). As the plasmids were diluted by multiple rounds of division, only nondividing or slowly dividing cells retained the label ( Figure 1 B). Of the cells that retained XFP, 28.5% were nondividing Ki67-niche astrocytes that co-expressed GFAP and s100β, the latter being expressed by niche astrocytes, but not NSCs ( Codega et al., 2014 14. Codega, P. ∙ Silva-Vargas, V. ∙ Paul, A. ... Prospective identification and purification of quiescent adult neural stem cells from their in vivo niche Neuron. 2014; 82 :545-559 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (460) PubMed Google Scholar ), while the majority (53.4% ± 2.5%) were slowly dividing NSCs (GFAP + /s100β − ) ( Figures 1 C and 1D). Among the electroporated NSCs, 7.1% ± 1.7% were Ki67 + and hence proliferating activated NSCs (aNSCs). To ensure labeling specificity, we took advantage of the previously established fact that NSCs, unlike astrocytes and ependymal cells, exhibit coincident activity of the GFAP and prominin (P2) promoters ( Beckervordersandforth et al., 2010 7. Beckervordersandforth, R. ∙ Tripathi, P. ∙ Ninkovic, J. ...

Prospective identification and purification of quiescent adult neural stem cells from their in vivo niche Neuron. 2014; 82 :545-559 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (460) PubMed Google Scholar ). When P0–P1 pups were electroporated with two plasmids that drive the expression of GFP and mCherry under the GFAP and prominin (P2) promoters, respectively, hardly any niche astrocytes were labeled, as almost all labeled cells were s100β − . The percentage of activated Ki67 + NSCs among GFP + /mCherry + electroporated cells in the SVZ was 7.7% ± 1.0% at P60 ( Figure 1 E; Table S1 ), a virtually identical value to the one obtained by analyzing GFAP + /s100β − /Ki67 + XFP cells described above. We could thus reliably label NSCs, a small proportion of which are activated at a given stage, which is consistent with previous work ( Codega et al., 2014 14.

This labeling method enabled us to explore the dynamics of NSC division in freely behaving mice by live in vivo imaging. To achieve this, we used miniature microscopes (mini-endoscopes) connected to a gradient index (GRIN) lens (0.5 mm in diameter) inserted into the SVZ of adult mice (P60–P90) after electroporating CMV-GFP into P0–P1 pups ( Figure 1 F; Video S1 ). Immunolabeling for Ki67 in the SVZ following the insertion of the GRIN lens did not reveal any changes in the number of proliferating NSCs ( Figure S1 ). To further ascertain that the dynamics of NSC activation are not affected by the insertion of the GRIN lens into the SVZ, we also used a side-view mini-endoscope composed of a GRIN lens with a 45° prism glued to it ( Figures 1 F and 1G and S1 ). This mini-endoscope made it possible to perform side-view imaging of NSCs located at the lateral wall of the SVZ with the GRIN lens installed in the lateral ventricle ( Figure 1 G). No differences in the dynamics of NSC division were observed using either of these two mini-endoscopic implants. We could thus pool data from both approaches to image sparse label-retaining NSCs in vivo . Live imaging of adult NSCs (one image every 15 min) for several hours showed that a long quiescent phase is followed by a cell-division phase lasting 83.3 ± 11.4 min (n = 20 cells; Figures 1 H and 1J; Table S1 ; Video S2 ). NSC division was defined as completed mitosis of the mother cell with high fluorescence intensity into two clearly discernable daughter cells with reduced fluorescence intensities due to the dilution of the fluorophore in the two daughter cells ( Figure 1 H; Videos S2 and S3 ). The start of cell division was defined as the first time frame preceding the reduction in fluorescence intensity ( Figure 1 H, 9:00 a.m.) and the end of cell division as the time frame when two clearly discernable cells are observed ( Figure 1 H, 9:30 a.m.). This analysis focused on cell division (i.e., the M phase) and did not measure the full cell-cycle length, including the typically long G1 phase. To ascertain the identity of the NSCs during the in vivo imaging, we also used a two-color mini-endoscope to image NSCs labeled by the co-electroporation of the CMV-RFP and prominin (P2)-GFP plasmids and observed the same dynamics of NSC division (92.1 ± 20.3 min, n = 7 cells; Figures 1 I and 1J; Table S1 ). Two-color imaging allowed NSC division to be detected in two different channels using two different promoter-driven fluorophores, which alleviated issues associated with cell movement that may arise during one-color imaging. This validated the robustness and sensitivity of mini-endoscopic imaging for monitoring NSC division in freely behaving mice. In all of these experiments, the NSCs remained in the same position and did not migrate during the imaging, which is consistent with a previous report showing that GFAP-GFP + and nestin-GFP + cells in the SVZ are static and nonmigratory in acute brain slice preparations ( Kim et al., 2009 29.

Six other examples of NSC division in freely behaving mice, related to Figure 1 Time-lapse imaging of NSC division, with one image every 15 min for several hours in freely behaving mice. The arrows indicate NSCs undergoing division. Each video for each individual NSC is outlined by a different color. The first and last time frames for each individual NSC are also shown at the end of the video to facilitate the assessment of NSC division. For these specific videos the static noise was removed and a non-local means denoising algorithm was applied followed by deconvolution. The Richardson-Lucy iteration algorithm was chosen with an arbitrary Point Spread Function (PSF) of an optical system as an approximation.
Our mini-endoscopic imaging in freely behaving mice made it possible to determine whether NSC division is regulated by different behavioral states and whether it is different during the day and the night. To this end, we continuously imaged NSCs for 2–3 days, with one acquisition every 15 min ( Figure 2 A; Video S4 ). Surprisingly, we observed a higher propensity for NSC division during the day compared to the night ( Figure 2 B). Approximately 70% of NSC division occurred during the day, with a peak at 2–5 h Zeitgeber time (ZT), corresponding to 9–12 a.m. ( Figure 2 B). To ascertain day/night differences in the activation of NSCs, we examined the number of GFP + /mCherry + /Ki67 + cells in the fixed tissue, in the adult mice that had been electroporated at P0–P1 with the GFAP-GFP and prominin (P2)-mCherry plasmids at ZT 8 (3 p.m.) and ZT 18 (1 a.m.). A higher proportion of proliferating NSCs was detected at ZT 8 (during the day) than at ZT 18 (during the night), which was consistent with the live imaging data ( Figures 2 C and 2D). This effect was specific to SVZ NSCs, as no difference in the density of niche astrocytes was observed ( Figure S2 ). To further probe the influence of the day/night cycle on the regulation of NSC division, we kept adult GFAP-GFP and prominin (P2)-mCherry electroporated mice for 3 or 7 days in complete darkness. The control mice were kept on a 12-h/12-h light/dark cycle ( Figure 2 E). Immunolabeling for Ki67 revealed no difference with 3 days of constant darkness, while 7 days of constant darkness led to a significant reduction in the number of proliferating NSCs ( Figures 2 F and 2G; Table S1 ). Notably, NSCs are mostly quiescent, with few proliferating NSCs under baseline conditions during the 12-h/12-h light/dark cycle, such that a further decrease is difficult to detect and may hence require a longer inhibition time as during 7 days of darkness. To overcome this, we took an opposite approach and maintained mice in constant 250-lux light for 3 or 7 days. Indeed, this resulted in a 2.5- and 4-fold increase in the percentage of Ki67 + proliferating NSCs in the SVZ, respectively ( Figures 2 F and 2G; Table S1 ). To determine whether the increased proliferation of NSCs reflects a shorter G0 phase or the recruitment of more NSCs into cycle, we performed clustering analysis by monitoring the position of aNSCs relative to each other. Our data revealed only few clusters, suggesting that constant 250-lux induces NSC activation. Altogether, these data indicate that the day/night cycle has a marked impact on NSC activation.

To identify the mechanisms involved in this NSC activation, we focused on melatonin, a circadian hormone that is secreted by the pineal gland in response to darkness ( Nakahara et al., 2003 41. Nakahara, D. ∙ Nakamura, M. ∙ Iigo, M. ... Bimodal circadian secretion of melatonin from the pineal gland in a living CBA mouse Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100 :9584-9589 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ) and that inhibits the proliferation of cancer cells and tumor growth ( Blask et al., 2002 9. Blask, D.E. ∙ Sauer, L.A. ∙ Dauchy, R.T. Melatonin as a chronobiotic/anticancer agent: cellular, biochemical, and molecular mechanisms of action and their implications for circadian-based cancer therapy Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2002; 2 :113-132 Crossref Scopus (351) PubMed Google Scholar ). Melatonin secretion is bimodal, with a first peak at the day/night transition and a second larger peak around midnight ( Nakahara et al., 2003 41. Nakahara, D. ∙ Nakamura, M. ∙ Iigo, M. ... Bimodal circadian secretion of melatonin from the pineal gland in a living CBA mouse Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100 :9584-9589 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ). To determine whether NSC division is regulated by melatonin signaling, we first used RNAscope in situ hybridization for two melatonin receptors (MTR), MTR1a and MTR1b. Interestingly, these two G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) of melatonin were expressed at higher levels in the SVZ than in the striatum ( Figures 2 H and 2I). In the SVZ, nearly all cells labeled with DAPI expressed the MTR1a and MTR1b receptors ( Figures 2 H and 2I). To determine whether NSCs also express these receptors, we performed multiplex RNAscope in situ hybridization for GFP, mCherry, and MTR1a or MTR1b on adult mice electroporated with the GFAP-GFP and prominin (P2)-mCherry plasmids at P0–P1. Our analysis revealed that, like other cells in the SVZ, NSCs express these GPCRs ( Figures 2 H and 2I). Encouraged by the expression of melatonin receptors on NSCs, we proceeded to functional experiments and blocked their activity using luzindole, a nonselective inhibitor of MTR1a and MTR1b. Adult mice electroporated at P0–P1 with the GFAP-GFP and prominin (P2)-mCherry plasmids received two injections of luzindole for 7 days at 6 p.m. and 11 p.m., i.e., 1 h before each melatonin secretion peak ( Figure 2 J). Immunolabeling for Ki67 revealed that luzindole increases the number of proliferative NSCs in the SVZ ( Figures 2 K and 2L; Table S1 ). Conversely, the same injection paradigm of luzindole twice a day for 7 days had no effect on the number of Ki67 + proliferating NSCs when the injections were performed during the day ( Figure 2 L; Table S1 ) (i.e., at 9 a.m. and 2 p.m., when melatonin levels are low; Nakahara et al., 2003 41. Nakahara, D. ∙ Nakamura, M. ∙ Iigo, M. ... Bimodal circadian secretion of melatonin from the pineal gland in a living CBA mouse Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100 :9584-9589 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ). To increase melatonin levels during the daytime, we injected melatonin at 9 a.m. and 2 p.m. for 7 days, which resulted in the expected decrease in the activation of NSC compared to control DMSO-injected mice ( Figures 2 K and 2L; Table S1 ). To determine whether melatonin signaling also affects the dynamics of NSC division in freely behaving mice, we installed mini-endoscopes in adult mice electroporated with the CMV-GFP plasmid at P1. We performed in vivo imaging of NSCs following luzindole injections twice a day at 6 p.m. and 11 p.m. for 5 days ( Figure 2 M). In these experiments, two 48-h sessions of continuous NSC imaging were performed (1 image every 15 min). The two sessions were interrupted by a 24-h rest period during which the NSCs were not imaged. Interestingly, luzindole injections affected the day/night dependence of NSC activation ( Figures 2 N–2O), with 50% of NSC division occurring during the night ( Figure 2 O) compared with only 31.25% under baseline conditions ( Figure 2 B), with no significant changes in the duration of division phase (113.6 ± 13 min, n = 6 cells). These results indicate that day/night regulation of NSC division is mediated by melatonin signaling.
As neuronal activity regulates NSC physiology ( Song et al., 2016 50. Song, J. ∙ Olsen, R.H. ∙ Sun, J. ... Neuronal circuitry mechanisms regulating adult mammalian neurogenesis Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2016; 8 :a018937 Crossref Scopus (87) PubMed Google Scholar ) and melatonin affects intracellular Ca 2+ dynamics ( de Faria Poloni et al., 2011 16. de Faria Poloni, J. ∙ Feltes, B.C. ∙ Bonatto, D. Melatonin as a central molecule connecting neural development and calcium signaling Funct. Integr. Genomics. 2011; 11 :383-388 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ), we next studied the role of intracellular Ca 2+ signaling in adult NSCs in freely behaving animals. We co-electroporated a genetically encoded Ca 2+ indicator (GCaMP6s) and a proliferation sensor (geminin 1–110 -mCherry) driven by the GFAP and CMV promoters, respectively, into P0–P1 pups and performed two-color mini-endoscopic imaging in adulthood ( Figure 3 A). Intriguingly, GFAP-GCaMP6s + /geminin + aNSCs displayed a significantly lower frequency and amplitude of Ca 2+ transients than GFAP-GCaMP6s + /geminin − cells ( Figures 3 B–3D; Table S2 ). As GFAP-GCaMP6s + /geminin − cells may be niche astrocytes or quiescent NSCs (qNSCs), we performed 1-h Ca 2+ imaging (one acquisition every 30 s) of GFAP-GCaMP6s + cells in acute brain slices containing the SVZ followed by fixing and immunostaining for s100β and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) ( Figures S2 and S3 ). This post hoc immunolabeling made it possible to distinguish and accurately assess Ca 2+ dynamics in NSCs ( Figures 3 E–3G and S3 ) or niche astrocytes ( Figure S2 ). Our experiments confirmed that the transition from the quiescent (s100β − /PCNA − ) to the proliferative (s100β − /PCNA + ) state of NSCs is associated with a reduced frequency and amplitude of Ca 2+ transients ( Figures 3 E–3G; Table S2 ; Video S5 ). The same results were obtained using the dual labeling strategy for NSCs electroporated at P0–P1 with the GFAP-GCaMP6s and prominin (P2)-mCherry plasmids followed in adulthood by Ca 2+ imaging in slices and post hoc immunostaining for Ki67 ( Figures 3 H–3J and S3 ; Table S2 ). These data further confirmed that qNSCs and aNSCs exhibit different Ca 2+ dynamics, with a higher frequency and amplitude in qNSCs. To rule out any effect of long-term buffering of Ca 2+ by GCaMP6s on NSC physiology, we performed experiments with an organic Ca 2+ indicator (Rhod2-AM) in bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-label-retaining cells in GFAP-GFP mice followed by post hoc identification of imaged cells and again observed a difference in Ca 2+ transients between qNSCs and aNSCs ( Figure S3 ).

Ca 2+ activity in qNSCs and aNSCs in acute brain sections, related to Figure 3 Time-lapse Ca 2+ imaging of qNSCs and aNSCs. Imaging was performed on acute brain sections 2 months after the electroporation of the GFAP-GCaMP6s plasmid at P0-P1. The identity of imaged cells was determined by post hoc immunolabeling for PCNA and s100β. Insets show the Ca 2+ traces of imaged cells. Note higher basal fluorescence of the GCaMP6s signal in aNSCs suggesting for higher level of intracellular Ca 2+ .
In addition to the distinct frequency and amplitude of spontaneous Ca 2+ events in qNSCs and aNSCs, we also observed higher basal fluorescence of the GCaMP6s signal in aNSCs in vivo and in slices, hinting at different cytosolic levels of intracellular Ca 2+ in qNSCs and aNSCs ( Figures 3 B, 3E, 3F, 3H, and 3I; Video S5 ). Indeed, the ratiometric Ca 2+ indicator Twitch-2B ( Thestrup et al., 2014 51. Thestrup, T. ∙ Litzlbauer, J. ∙ Bartholomäus, I. ... Optimized ratiometric calcium sensors for functional in vivo imaging of neurons and T lymphocytes Nat. Methods. 2014; 11 :175-182 Crossref Scopus (275) PubMed Google Scholar ), driven by the GFAP promoter, revealed that there are higher steady-state cytosolic intracellular Ca 2+ levels in aNSCs than in qNSCs ( Figures 3 K–3M; Table S2 ). Taken together, our results show that Ca 2+ dynamics and cytosolic levels change markedly in adult NSCs during their transition from the quiescent to the proliferative state.
Our in vivo imaging data demonstrated that NSC division is under the control of day/night cycle and that inhibiting melatonin signaling increases NSC proliferation ( Figure 2 ). Given the differences in Ca 2+ dynamics and steady-state intracellular levels in qNSCs and aNSCs, we performed Ca 2+ imaging in acute brain slices to determine whether the increase in proliferative NSCs when MTRs are blocked is linked to Ca 2+ signaling. Prior to this, we first determined the reliability of the acute slice preparation with respect to melatonin levels by applying the inhibitor luzindole at different concentrations for 3 h to acute slices from P45–P60 mice that had received the GFAP-GFP and prominin (P2)-mCherry plasmids at P0–P1. The acute slices were prepared at 1–2 a.m., when melatonin levels are high ( Nakahara et al., 2003 41. Nakahara, D. ∙ Nakamura, M. ∙ Iigo, M. ... Bimodal circadian secretion of melatonin from the pineal gland in a living CBA mouse Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100 :9584-9589 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ). Post hoc immunolabeling for Ki67 revealed a 3- to 4-fold increase in the number of proliferating Ki67 + NSCs ( Figures 4 A and 4B), which is consistent with our in vivo data ( Figure 2 L). We next prepared acute brain slices from adult mice at the same time (1–2 a.m.) that had been electroporated at P0–P1 with GFAP-GCaMP6s and performed Ca 2+ imaging under baseline conditions and following application of luzindole (15 μM) ( Figure 4 C). To minimize potential melatonin washout in the acute brain slices by the 1–2 mL/min flow rate of artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF), we performed imaging only for 20–25 min (10 min at baseline followed by 10–15 min in the presence of luzindole, with one acquisition every 10 s). The Ca 2+ imaging was followed by post hoc identification of qNSCs and aNSCs by immunostaining for PCNA and s100β. Interestingly, luzindole decreased the frequency of Ca 2+ fluctuations in qNSCs ( Figure 4 D; Video S6 ). To investigate whether blocking MTRs also increases cytosolic Ca 2+ levels in vivo , we electroporated mice with GFAP-Twitch2B and prominin (P2)-mCherry at P0–P1 and injected luzindole i.p. in adulthood twice a day at 6 p.m. and 11 p.m. for 7 days ( Figure 4 E). The luzindole injections increased the steady-state intracellular levels of Ca 2+ in qNSCs, but not in aNSCs ( Figures 4 F and 4G). This showed that luzindole-mediated changes in NSC activation in acute brain slices ( Figures 4 A and 4B) and in vivo ( Figures 2 K–2L) are linked to modifications in intracellular Ca 2+ levels and the frequency of Ca 2+ fluctuations observed both in vivo and ex vivo ( Figures 4 C–4G).

Ca 2+ activity in qNSCs following the application of luzindole, related to Figure 4 Time-lapse Ca 2+ imaging of qNSCs under baseline conditions (left panel) and following the application of luzindole (right panel). Imaging was performed on acute brain slices prepared at 1-2 a.m. from the adult mouse that had been electroporated with GFAP-GCaMP6s plasmid at P0-P1. The identity of imaged cells was determined by post hoc immunolabeling for PCNA and s100β.
We next aimed to compare the novel role of luzindole in affecting NSC proliferation and Ca 2+ levels and dynamics to well-known stimulators of NSC division, such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), a highly potent pro-proliferative factor that triggers NSC and progenitor division ( Doetsch et al., 2002 18.

Neurosci. 2015; 9 :407 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ). We performed Ca 2+ imaging for 1 h under baseline conditions and following a 1-h application of EGF (0.1 μg/mL) in adult brain slices from mice electroporated at P0–P1 with the GFAP-GCaMP6 plasmid ( Figure 5 A) followed by a post hoc identification of qNSCs and aNSCs as described above ( Figures 5 B and S3 ). Consistent with the effects of luzindole, EGF decreased the frequency and amplitude of Ca 2+ signals in qNSCs ( Figures 5 C and 5D; Video S7 ) and further lowered the frequency of Ca 2+ signals in aNSCs, with no change in the amplitude ( Figures 5 C and 5D). To determine whether EGF also affects intracellular Ca 2+ levels, we incubated adult brain slices from mice electroporated at P0–P1 with the GFAP-Twitch2B plasmid with EGF followed by a post hoc identification of qNSCs and aNSCs. This incubation led to an increase in intracellular Ca 2+ levels in qNSCs, but not in aNSCs ( Figures 5 E and 5F). To ensure that the observed changes in Ca 2+ dynamics and cytosolic levels were linked to an increased proliferation of NSCs, we incubated acute brain slices from adult mice that had been electroporated with GFAP-GFP and prominin (P2)-mCherry plasmids at P0–P1 in EGF (0.1 μg/mL) for 3 h. As expected, this increased the number of proliferative NSCs ( Figures 5 G and 5H). These data and previous reports showing that EGF increases the proliferation of NSCs ( Doetsch et al., 2002 18. Doetsch, F. ∙ Petreanu, L. ∙ Caille, I. ... EGF converts transit-amplifying neurogenic precursors in the adult brain into multipotent stem cells Neuron. 2002; 36 :1021-1034 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (886) PubMed Google Scholar ; Joppé et al., 2015 28.

Neurosci. 2015; 9 :407 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ) imply that EGF receptors (EGFR) are already expressed in qNSCs. To test this hypothesis, we sorted qNSCs and aNSCs from the SVZ of GFAP-GFP mice based on the expression of GFP, CD133 (prominin), and EGFR ( Beckervordersandforth et al., 2010 7. Beckervordersandforth, R. ∙ Tripathi, P. ∙ Ninkovic, J. ...

We detected EGFR transcripts in qNSCs, albeit at lower levels than in aNSCs ( Figure S4 ). Altogether, our results suggest that the intracellular Ca 2+ levels and dynamics of NSCs are modulated by pro-proliferative factors such as EGF in a way similar to the effects observed when luzindole blocks melatonin receptors.

Melatonin receptors are GPCRs, while EGF binds to receptor tyrosine kinase receptors. These two receptor families regulate Ca 2+ levels and the frequency of Ca 2+ fluctuations by various mechanisms ( de Faria Poloni et al., 2011 16. de Faria Poloni, J. ∙ Feltes, B.C. ∙ Bonatto, D. Melatonin as a central molecule connecting neural development and calcium signaling Funct. Integr. Genomics. 2011; 11 :383-388 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hodeify et al., 2018 25.

(Editors) Calcium Entry Channels in Non-Excitable Cells CRC Press/Taylor & Francis, 2018; 215-240 Google Scholar ). Accordingly, both melatonin and EGF have been shown to influence Ca 2+ release from internal stores ( Bach et al., 2005 4. Bach, A.G. ∙ Wolgast, S. ∙ Mühlbauer, E. ...

Chem. 1996; 271 :30505-30509 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ). To explore the role of internal stores in determining Ca 2+ dynamics and levels during the NSC transition from quiescence to proliferation, we first used 2APB (100 μM), which blocks Ca 2+ release from inositol trisphosphate (IP3)-sensitive intracellular stores, and thapsigargin (3 μM), which inhibits sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase (SERCA). Ca 2+ imaging of GFAP-GCaMP6s-electroporated cells before and after the pharmacological treatments was followed by the post hoc identification of qNSCs and aNSCs, as described above ( Figures 6 A, 6B, and S3 ). Our results showed that both 2APB and thapsigargin decrease the frequency of Ca 2+ events and increase cytosolic Ca 2+ levels in qNSCs, but not in aNSCs ( Figures 6 C–6E; Table S2 ). Importantly, these changes in Ca 2+ dynamics and levels increased the proliferation of NSCs ( Figure 6 F), indicating that they play a functional role in NSC activation. No changes were observed following the blocking of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA), transient receptor potential cation (TrpC), or transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TrpV4) channels ( Figure 6 C).
The drawback of the pharmacological approach is the lack of cell specificity, as it affects all cells in a slice. To address this limitation, we used CRISPR-Cas9 to delete Itpr2 , the receptor that regulates the release of Ca 2+ from internal stores, specifically in SVZ NSCs, by co-electroporating a plasmid encoding a guide RNA (gRNA) that targets Itpr2 , Cas9, and mCherry under the prominin (P2) promoter (pU6-gRNA-P2-Cas9-T2A-mCherry) with GFAP-GFP or GFAP-GCaMP6 ( Figures S3 and S4 ) and monitored Ca 2+ activity specifically in these double-labeled NSCs. Deleting Itpr2 in NSCs decreased the frequency of Ca 2+ events in qNSCs ( Figures 6 G–6I; Table S2 ) and led to the entry of qNSCs into the proliferative state ( Figures 6 J and 6K; Table S1 ). Importantly, this increase in NSC proliferation was sustained for several weeks as we detected a higher number of aNSCs at 10 and 60 days post-electroporation in vivo ( Figure 6 K). It is worth noting that we assess acutely dividing cells when monitoring Ki67. The data indicate that there was a 2-fold increase in acutely dividing NSCs at any given moment from P10 to P60, and thus, the total increase in NSC proliferation over the entire period should be cumulative and hence in total much higher. Taken together, these results show that there is a causal relationship between internal store-dependent Ca 2+ dynamics in NSCs and their transition from the quiescent to the proliferative state.
The results reported above showed that the deletion of Itpr2 or 3 days of constant 250-lux light increase the number of proliferating NSCs in vivo . It remains unclear, however, whether the modulation of Ca 2+ dynamics alone can reverse the transition of NSCs from the quiescent to the proliferative state. To directly regulate Ca 2+ dynamics in NSCs of freely behaving mice in vivo , we optogenetically manipulated Ca 2+ dynamics using hBACCS2, a light-inducible actuator that allows the entry of Ca 2+ via ORAI channels ( Ishii et al., 2015 27. Ishii, T. ∙ Sato, K. ∙ Kakumoto, T. ... Light generation of intracellular Ca(2+) signals by a genetically encoded protein BACCS Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 :8021 Crossref Scopus (65) PubMed Google Scholar ). We first made sure that the optogenetic activation of hBACCS2 induces Ca 2+ entry into adult SVZ cells. To do so, we electroporated mice with GFAP-hBACCS2-IRES-GFP at P0–P1, prepared acute brain slices at P45–P60, and loaded the slices with the Rhod2-AM organic Ca 2+ indicator ( Figure 7 A). Ca 2+ activity was imaged under baseline conditions and following a single 60-s optogenetic stimulation at 488 nm. This showed that the light-induced stimulation of GFAP-hBACCS2 + cells increases Rhod2 fluorescent intensity in these cells ( Figure 7 B). After validating this construct, we proceeded to in vivo experiments by co-electroporating GFAP-hBACCS2-IRES-GFP (or GFAP-GFP as a control) together with Itpr2 gRNAs and Cas9 under the prominin (P2) promoter at P0–P1 and installing two optical fibers in the lateral ventricle at P60–P90 to cover the entire medio-lateral portion of the SVZ ( Figures 7 C and S5 ). To compensate for the 2-fold reduction in the Ca 2+ frequency induced by the Itpr2 deletion in qNSCs, we optogenetically stimulated NSCs with five or six pulses per hour for 3 days. Light-induced Ca 2+ entry into NSCs for 3 days restored the changes in proliferation induced by Itpr2 gene editing ( Figures 7 D and 7E; Table S1 ). Importantly, no effects were observed in the two control groups, one of which received no stimulation and one of which was optogenetically stimulated but did not receive the hBACCS2 construct ( Figures 7 D and 7E; Table S1 ).
As NSC activation was also regulated by the day/night cycle ( Figure 2 ) through melatonin signaling-mediated changes in Ca 2+ dynamics and levels ( Figure 4 ), we determined whether optogenetically induced Ca 2+ entry into NSCs would also restore the 3-day constant 250-lux light-induced increase in NSC proliferation. We thus co-electroporated GFAP-hBACCS2-IRES-GFP (or GFAP-GFP as a control) together with prominin (P2)-mCherry at P0–P1 and installed two optical fibers in the lateral ventricle in adulthood ( Figure 7 F). We kept the mice in constant 250-lux light for 3 days and at the same time optogenetically stimulated the NSCs as described above. Interestingly, optogenetically induced Ca 2+ entry into NSCs also reverted the constant light-induced transition to the proliferative state ( Figures 7 G and 7H). Altogether, our experiments demonstrate that there is a causal link between Ca 2+ signaling and NSC activation ( Figure 7 I) and reveal the key role played by subtype-specific Ca 2+ dynamics in qNSCs, which is sufficient to maintain the quiescent state even after promoting their transition to the activated state by prolonged daylight exposure or Itpr2 deletion.

Section: Discussion

Here, we provide the live in vivo imaging of NSCs in freely behaving mice monitoring their activation and division which led to two major new discoveries: their activation is biased to the beginning of the daylight time and is accompanied by changes in Ca 2+ dynamics and intracellular steady-state levels.
Live imaging of adult NSCs has already led to major insights, such as the discovery of the direct conversion of NSCs into neurons in the zebrafish forebrain and the discovery of self-renewing transit-amplifying daughter cells in the dentate gyrus ( Barbosa et al., 2015 6. Barbosa, J.S. ∙ Sanchez-Gonzalez, R. ∙ Di Giaimo, R. ... Neurodevelopment. Live imaging of adult neural stem cell behavior in the intact and injured zebrafish brain Science. 2015; 348 :789-793 Crossref Scopus (143) PubMed Google Scholar ; Pilz et al., 2018 46. Pilz, G.A. ∙ Bottes, S. ∙ Betizeau, M. ... Live imaging of neurogenesis in the adult mouse hippocampus Science. 2018; 359 :658-662 Crossref Scopus (225) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, in addition to the possible side effects of immobilization or anesthesia, certain aspects of NSC physiology can only be studied by continuous (every 15 min) imaging in freely behaving mice. One issue that could not be addressed previously is when NSC activation occurs over one or more 24-h cycles, as imaging could not be performed continuously for several days in animals that naturally explore their environment and go through several 24-h cycles. We used advanced mini-endoscopic imaging and observed a striking 70% bias toward NSC division during the daylight period. We corroborated these findings by demonstrating that constant light conditions as well as blocking MTR1a and MTR1b by luzindole during the night increase NSC activation and division, whereas constant darkness or stimulating MTR1a and MTR1b with melatonin during the day decrease NSC activation. Thus, the hormone melatonin, which is released in response to darkness ( Nakahara et al., 2003 41. Nakahara, D. ∙ Nakamura, M. ∙ Iigo, M. ... Bimodal circadian secretion of melatonin from the pineal gland in a living CBA mouse Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100 :9584-9589 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ), inhibits NSC activation, shifting NSC division in large part to the daylight period.
Interestingly, clock genes that regulate circadian rhythms have been shown to regulate stem cell behavior in other organs ( Benitah and Welz, 2020 8. Benitah, S.A. ∙ Welz, P.S. Circadian regulation of adult stem cell homeostasis and aging Cell Stem Cell. 2020; 26 :817-831 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ; Plikus et al., 2013 47.

USA. 2013; 110 :E2106-E2115 Crossref Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ; Samsa et al., 2016 49. Samsa, W.E. ∙ Vasanji, A. ∙ Midura, R.J. ... Deficiency of circadian clock protein BMAL1 in mice results in a low bone mass phenotype Bone. 2016; 84 :194-203 Crossref Scopus (99) PubMed Google Scholar ) as well as progenitor proliferation in the adult dentate gyrus ( Bouchard-Cannon et al., 2013 10. Bouchard-Cannon, P. ∙ Mendoza-Viveros, L. ∙ Yuen, A. ... The circadian molecular clock regulates adult hippocampal neurogenesis by controlling the timing of cell-cycle entry and exit Cell Rep. 2013; 5 :961-973 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (119) PubMed Google Scholar ). The lack of PERIOD2 abolishes the entry of progenitor cells into the cell cycle, while the genetic ablation of BMAL1 delays the exit of dentate gyrus progenitor cells from the cell cycle ( Bouchard-Cannon et al., 2013 10. Bouchard-Cannon, P. ∙ Mendoza-Viveros, L. ∙ Yuen, A. ... The circadian molecular clock regulates adult hippocampal neurogenesis by controlling the timing of cell-cycle entry and exit Cell Rep. 2013; 5 :961-973 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (119) PubMed Google Scholar ). It remains unclear, however, which signals integrate stem cell activation with circadian rhythms and animal behavior. This has particular relevance for NSCs, since brain neural networks govern animal behavior. Our data provide information on how external stimuli regulate the day/night activity of NSCs. Since mice are nocturnal animals, this also raised the interesting possibility that NSC division may be regulated by the sleep/wake cycle. Future experiments correlating NSC imaging using mini-endoscopes and rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM sleep recordings will be required to address this issue. It should be noted, however, that melatonin release is induced by darkness in both nocturnal and diurnal animals ( Macchi and Bruce, 2004 38. Macchi, M.M. ∙ Bruce, J.N. Human pineal physiology and functional significance of melatonin Front. Neuroendocrinol. 2004; 25 :177-195 Crossref Scopus (450) PubMed Google Scholar ), indicating that the inhibitory effects of melatonin on NSC activation observed in our study should occur independently of the sleep/wake state of the animals. However, additional signals may be superimposed on the regulation of NSC activation during the sleep/wake cycle. It would thus be interesting to assess NSC division in both diurnal and nocturnal animals. This would shed light on the possible complex interplay between regulatory factors that operate during the day/night and sleep/wake cycles and how combination of these factors modulates NSC activity.
It also remains so far unclear whether melatonin-induced modulation of NSC proliferation is cell autonomous or is triggered by the activation of other cell types in the SVZ that also express these receptors and signal to NSCs to modulate their transition from the quiescent to the proliferative state. Future studies using NSC-specific gene editing for MTR1a and MTR1b may help addressing this issue. Interestingly, hunger and satiety regulate NSC activation via axonal projections from hypothalamic proopiomelanocortin neurons that converge in the ventral SVZ ( Paul et al., 2017 43. Paul, A. ∙ Chaker, Z. ∙ Doetsch, F. Hypothalamic regulation of regionally distinct adult neural stem cells and neurogenesis Science. 2017; 356 :1383-1386 Crossref Scopus (96) PubMed Google Scholar ). As these are also subject to circadian rhythms ( Challet, 2019 13. Challet, E. The circadian regulation of food intake Nat. Rev. Endocrinol. 2019; 15 :393-405 Crossref Scopus (248) PubMed Google Scholar ), day/night signaling may be upstream and may contribute to the hunger- and satiety-induced activation of NSCs. Importantly, the NSC imaging technology developed in the present study now makes it possible to investigate how NSC function adapts in response to different behavioral states.
The second major advance in the present study is that our in vivo analysis of Ca 2+ dynamics and intracellular levels in NSCs unraveled a general mechanism of NSC activation. Our results showed that not only are the quiescent and proliferative states of NSCs determined by striking differences in intracellular Ca 2+ dynamics and steady-state cytosolic levels but also that changes in Ca 2+ dynamics and steady-state cytosolic levels drive NSC behavior in vivo . We uncovered a Ca 2+ signature of quiescent and active NSCs and showed that qNSCs exhibit a higher frequency and amplitude of Ca 2+ events but lower cytosolic Ca 2+ levels than aNSCs. Our results further showed that several signaling pathways converge on Ca 2+ to regulate the NSC transition from quiescence to proliferation. Inhibiting the quiescence-associated melatonin signaling pathway activates NSCs by reducing the frequency of Ca 2+ fluctuations and increasing intracellular Ca 2+ levels, and potentiating NSC division by EGF, a well-known factor that activates NSCs ( Doetsch et al., 2002 18. Doetsch, F. ∙ Petreanu, L. ∙ Caille, I. ... EGF converts transit-amplifying neurogenic precursors in the adult brain into multipotent stem cells Neuron. 2002; 36 :1021-1034 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (886) PubMed Google Scholar ; Joppé et al., 2015 28.

Neurosci. 2015; 9 :407 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ), affects Ca 2+ dynamics and levels in the same manner. We also unraveled the signaling mechanisms underlying these different Ca 2+ dynamics and showed that IP3-sensitive intracellular stores sustain Ca 2+ signaling in the quiescent state. Interestingly, both EGFR and MTR1 activity affect mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, while MTRs inhibits it ( Blask et al., 2002 9. Blask, D.E. ∙ Sauer, L.A. ∙ Dauchy, R.T. Melatonin as a chronobiotic/anticancer agent: cellular, biochemical, and molecular mechanisms of action and their implications for circadian-based cancer therapy Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2002; 2 :113-132 Crossref Scopus (351) PubMed Google Scholar ) and EGFR activates it ( Avraham and Yarden, 2011 3. Avraham, R. ∙ Yarden, Y. Feedback regulation of EGFR signalling: decision making by early and delayed loops Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 12 :104-117 Crossref Scopus (535) PubMed Google Scholar ). Both signaling pathways also affect intracellular Ca 2+ levels via IP3-sensitive intracellular stores ( de Faria Poloni et al., 2011 16. de Faria Poloni, J. ∙ Feltes, B.C. ∙ Bonatto, D. Melatonin as a central molecule connecting neural development and calcium signaling Funct. Integr. Genomics. 2011; 11 :383-388 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hodeify et al., 2018 25. Hodeify, R. ∙ Yu, F. ∙ Courjaret, R. ... Regulation and role of store-operated Ca(2+) entry in cellular proliferation Kozak, J.A. ∙ Putney, Jr., J.W. (Editors) Calcium Entry Channels in Non-Excitable Cells CRC Press/Taylor & Francis, 2018; 215-240 Google Scholar ), supporting the concept that the frequency of Ca 2+ signals may act as an integrator and decoder of various signals that then mediate the transition of NSCs from the quiescent to the active state ( Figure 7 I). Recent observations showing that fluid flow promotes the proliferation of SVZ progenitors via the epithelial sodium-channel-dependent activation of Ca 2+ -release activated channels (CRAC) and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) phosphorylation ( Petrik et al., 2018 45. Petrik, D. ∙ Myoga, M.H. ∙ Grade, S. ... Epithelial sodium channel regulates adult neural stem cell proliferation in a flow-dependent manner Cell Stem Cell. 2018; 22 :865-878.e8 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ) are also in line with this concept. Altogether, these results suggest that microenvironmental signals involved in the day/night, mitogenic, and cerebrospinal-fluid-induced regulation of NSCs converge on intracellular Ca 2+ signaling pathways to mediate NSC quiescence and proliferation.
Interestingly, similar Ca 2+ dynamics have been observed in gut and skin somatic stem cells ( Deng et al., 2015 17. Deng, H. ∙ Gerencser, A.A. ∙ Jasper, H.

NFATc1 balances quiescence and proliferation of skin stem cells Cell. 2008; 132 :299-310 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (360) PubMed Google Scholar ) as well as in embryonic and hematopoietic stem cells in vitro ( Luchsinger et al., 2019 37. Luchsinger, L.L. ∙ Strikoudis, A. ∙ Danzl, N.M. ... Harnessing hematopoietic stem cell low intracellular calcium improves their maintenance in vitro Cell Stem Cell. 2019; 25 :225-240.e7 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ; MacDougall et al., 2019 39.

Intracellular Ca 2+ homeostasis and nuclear export mediate exit from naive pluripotency Cell Stem Cell. 2019; 25 :210-224.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ). In gut stem cells, high cytosolic Ca 2+ levels trigger proliferation, whereas Ca 2+ oscillations maintain quiescence ( Deng et al., 2015 17. Deng, H. ∙ Gerencser, A.A. ∙ Jasper, H. Signal integration by Ca(2+) regulates intestinal stem-cell activity Nature. 2015; 528 :212-217 Crossref Scopus (140) PubMed Google Scholar ; He et al., 2018 23. He, L. ∙ Si, G. ∙ Huang, J. ... Mechanical regulation of stem-cell differentiation by the stretch-activated Piezo channel Nature. 2018; 555 :103-106 Crossref Scopus (236) PubMed Google Scholar ). These changes in Ca 2+ dynamics are required to decode metabolic, mechanical, and growth factor signals that balance gut stem cell quiescence and proliferation ( Deng et al., 2015 17. Deng, H. ∙ Gerencser, A.A. ∙ Jasper, H. Signal integration by Ca(2+) regulates intestinal stem-cell activity Nature. 2015; 528 :212-217 Crossref Scopus (140) PubMed Google Scholar ; He et al., 2018 23. He, L. ∙ Si, G. ∙ Huang, J. ... Mechanical regulation of stem-cell differentiation by the stretch-activated Piezo channel Nature. 2018; 555 :103-106 Crossref Scopus (236) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, it was previously difficult to determine whether Ca 2+ signals simply accompany stem cell activation states or whether they are indeed causative. We showed, using in vivo optogenetics, that experimentally modulating Ca 2+ fluxes into NSCs to mimic their quiescent state is sufficient to reverse their transition to the proliferative state. These data strongly support the concept of Ca 2+ signaling as the integrator and decoder of multiple signals that determine the activation or quiescence of NSCs.
How do fluctuations in intracellular Ca 2+ levels trigger changes in NSC proliferation? Interestingly, IP3 uncaging induces Ca 2+ fluctuations and stimulates gene expression via nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) ( Li et al., 1998 35. Li, W. ∙ Llopis, J. ∙ Whitney, M. ... Cell-permeant caged InsP3 ester shows that Ca2+ spike frequency can optimize gene expression Nature. 1998; 392 :936-941 Crossref Scopus (786) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, changes in intracellular Ca 2+ levels, in particular via IP3 receptors (IP 3 R), may trigger gene transcription in skin stem cells via the calcineurin/NFAT pathway ( Horsley et al., 2008 26. Horsley, V. ∙ Aliprantis, A.O. ∙ Polak, L. ... NFATc1 balances quiescence and proliferation of skin stem cells Cell. 2008; 132 :299-310 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (360) PubMed Google Scholar ). It has been also shown that gene expression may be dynamically modulated by the frequency of Ca 2+ fluxes, their amplitude, and their duration ( Dolmetsch et al., 1997 19. Dolmetsch, R.E. ∙ Lewis, R.S. ∙ Goodnow, C.C. ... Differential activation of transcription factors induced by Ca2+ response amplitude and duration Nature. 1997; 386 :855-858 Crossref Scopus (1603) PubMed Google Scholar ; Dolmetsch et al., 1998 20. Dolmetsch, R.E. ∙ Xu, K. ∙ Lewis, R.S. Calcium oscillations increase the efficiency and specificity of gene expression Nature. 1998; 392 :933-936 Crossref Scopus (1716) PubMed Google Scholar ). It remains to be shown how different downstream effectors in NSCs respond to Ca 2+ signals of different cytosolic levels, amplitudes, and frequencies to initiate gene expression and the entry of NSCs into the activation phase. Most importantly, however, our data show that Ca 2+ dynamics and intracellular steady-state levels are a key mechanism regulating NSC activation in freely behaving mice and are the mediator of profound circadian regulation of NSC activity.

The experiments were performed using two- to six-month-old CD1 (Charles River) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-GFP (The Jackson Laboratory) mice of both sexes, which were electroporated on postnatal days 0-1 (P0-P1). All experiments were approved by the Université Laval animal protection committee. The mice were housed one to five per cage. It should be noted that while mice are nocturnal animals, in our experiments we did not assess their locomotor activity during the day and night. They were kept on a 12-h light/dark cycle at a constant temperature (22°C) with food and water ad libitum .
For the electroporation of plasmids, P0-P1 CD-1 or GFAP-GFP pups were anesthetized by hypothermia and were placed on the stereotactic frame. The plasmids (1 μL, 3-6 μg/μL total, except for GFAP-GCaMP6s and GFAP-Twitch-2B) were injected in the lateral ventricle using the following coordinates (with respect to the lambda): anterior-posterior (AP) 1.8 mm, medio-lateral (ML) 0.8 mm, and dorso-ventral (DV) 1.6 mm. For GFAP-GCaMP6s and GFAP-Twitch2B not more than 1 μg/μL of 1 μL of solution was used to avoid buffering the intracellular Ca 2+ with these Ca 2+ indicators. We used the following plasmids: cytomegalovirus (CMV)-GCaMP6s (#40753, Addgene), kindly provided by Dr. Kim & GENIE Project, Janelia Research Campus; CMV-geminin 1-110 -mCherry, kindly provided by Dr. Miyawaki, RIKEN; CMV-RFP (#54764, Addgene), kindly provided by Drs. Campbell, Davidson, and Tsien; CMV-GFP (#U55763, Clontech), CMV-Twitch-2B (#49531, Addgene), kindly provided by Dr. Griesbeck, Max Planck Institute; and CMV-hBACCS2-IRES-GFP (#72891, Addgene), kindly provided by Dr. Nakata, Tokyo Medical University. CMV-mCherry was generated by PCR amplification of the cDNA encoding mCherry from pLenti-CaMKII-hChR2-mCherry-WPRE (a gift from Dr. Deisseroth, Stanford University) with primers 5′-GCGCTACCGGTCGCCACCATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAGGAGGATAACA-3′ and 5′-CTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGCCGC-3′. The PCR product was then digested with AgeI–BsrGI and was inserted into the AgeI–BsrGI sites of U55763 vector (Clontech). GCaMP6s, Twitch-2B, hBACCS2-IRES-GFP, and GFP were sub-cloned under the GFAP promoter while mCherry was subcloned under the prominin (P2) promoter ( Beckervordersandforth et al., 2010 7. Beckervordersandforth, R. ∙ Tripathi, P. ∙ Ninkovic, J. ... In vivo fate mapping and expression analysis reveals molecular hallmarks of prospectively isolated adult neural stem cells Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 7 :744-758 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (273) PubMed Google Scholar ). The plasmid solution was supplemented with 1% Fast-Green to visualize the injection and ensure that the ventricle was filled with plasmid solution. Immediately after the injection, an electric field (five 50-ms 100-mV pulses at 950-ms intervals) was applied using an electrode positioned on the surface of the bones and coated with conductive gel. The pups were used 2-4 months post-electroporation. In experiments with gRNAs, we also analyzed mice 10 days post-electroporation. We used gRNAs for Itpr2 as well as for LacZ, as a control. We used two different gRNAs for Itpr2 and electroporated these plasmids together. The gRNAs were cloned in the BbsI site of the PU6-BbsI-CBh-Cas9-T2AmCherry plasmid (#64324, Addgene) kindly provided by Dr. Kuehn, Berlin Institute of Health) in which CBh was replaced by the prominin (P2) promoter.
Adult 2- to 3-month-old CD1 mice electroporated with different plasmids at P0-P1 were anesthetized with isoflurane (2%–3%) and were placed on the stereotactic frame. The temperature of the animals was maintained at 37°C throughout the procedure using an infrared blanket (Kent Scientific). An incision was made in the skin, a hole centered over the subventricular zone (SVZ) or lateral ventricle (LV) was drilled, and a cannula composed of a GRIN lens (0.5 mm in diameter and 3-5 mm in length) and an adjustment ring (Doric Lenses) was slowly lowered into the SVZ or LV to detect fluorescently labeled cells or overall changes in fluorescence. Metabond cement (Parkell Inc.) was used to fix the cannulas on the skull, and the skin was sutured. We used two different cannulas. In most cases we used a “side-view” cannula composed of a GRIN lens with a 45° prism glued to it. This configuration made it possible to insert the cannula into the LV and to detect fluorescently labeled cells during implantation. We also used a cannula with a flat GRIN lens implanted just above the SVZ ( Figure S1 ), which was determined by changes in the overall background fluorescence during implantation. Mini-endoscopic imaging started 10-14 days after the insertion of the side-view GRIN lens and 2-3 weeks after the implantation of the flat GRIN lens. To ensure that the positioning of the flat GRIN lens did not affect proliferation in the SVZ at the time of in vivo imaging, we removed the GRIN lens from a few mice 2-3 weeks post-implantation and immunolabelled for Ki67. No changes in the proliferation of NSCs were detected ( Figure S1 ). The cannulas were connected either to a one-color or a two-color mini-endoscope (Doric Lenses). The same cells could be imaged for up to 2-3 months. Imaging sessions consisted of 2-3 days of continuous imaging, with one image acquired every 15 min. For the GFAP-GCaMP6s experiments, the mice were imaged for 1 h with 1 image acquired every 30 s. The images were recorded for the XY positions and were corrected for xy drift using the StackReg ImageJ plugin, as needed. The two-color mini-endoscope allowed us to image cells labeled with two different fluorophores and driven by two different promoters. For these experiments, the mice were electroporated at P0-P1 with a combination of either CMV-RFP and prominin (P2)-GFP or GFAP-GCaMP6s and CMV-geminin-mCherry. For the cell division experiments using the CMV-RFP and prominin (P2)-GFP combination, the ubiquitous CMV promoter (instead of GFAP) made it possible to reliably detect fluorescent cells after cell division and avoid situations in which divided cells were not detected due to the lack of GFAP and prominin (P2) promoter activity in the daughter cells. For one-color mini-endoscopic imaging of GFP or GCaMP6, we used 458/35 and 525/40 excitation and emission filters, respectively, with a 300-ms exposure time. For two-color mini-endoscopic imaging, we used LED and YAG illumination sources (Doric Lenses) with 430-477 nm and 558-564 nm excitation filters for GCaMP6s (or GFP) and mCherry imaging, respectively, and 520/35 and 615/45 emission filters, respectively, with a 300-ms exposure time.
For in vivo optogenetic stimulations, adult CD1 mice that had been electroporated at P0-P1 with GFAP-hBACCS2-GFP (or GFAP-GFP as a control) and Itpr2 gRNA-P2-Cas9-T2A-mCherry (or prominin [P2]-mCherry) were anesthetized with isoflurane (2%–3%) and were placed on the stereotactic frame. The surgery was performed as described above, and two optogenetic fibers (DFC-200/250-0.66-2.7mm-GS0.7-MA45, 200 μm diameter fiber; Doric Lenses), with a 0.7-mm pitch between fibers, were slowly lowered into the LV at the following coordinates: AP 0.5 mm; ML 0.4-1.1 mm; and DV 2.2 mm. The tips of both fibers had a mirror angle of 45°, which made it possible to direct the light to the lateral wall of the LV. The 0.7-mm pitch made it possible to cover the entire medio-lateral portion of the SVZ. After a 2- week recovery period, the mice were connected to a 488-LED illumination source, and 4.1-mW/mm 2 60 s pulses were randomly delivered five times over a period of 1 h for 3 days. The length of the stimuli was based on the properties of hBACCS2, which has a peak Ca 2+ response at 60 s ( Ishii et al., 2015 27. Ishii, T. ∙ Sato, K. ∙ Kakumoto, T. ... Light generation of intracellular Ca(2+) signals by a genetically encoded protein BACCS Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 :8021 Crossref Scopus (65) PubMed Google Scholar ). Since Itpr2 gene editing caused a 2-fold decrease in the frequency of Ca 2+ events in qNSCs ( Figure 6 ), we optogenetically stimulated NSCs to compensate for the reduced frequency. After the 3-day stimulation protocol, the mice were perfused and 40-μm-thick brain slices were immunolabelled for Ki67. The same stimulation parameters were used for the experiments with 250-lux constant light condition. Proliferative NSCs were counted in the entire medio-lateral portion of the dorsal SVZ.
To validate that optogenetic stimulation covers the entire medio-lateral portion of the SVZ, we modeled the light diffusion in the brain based on the illumination power, the angle of the fibers, and the pitch between two fibers ( Figure S5 ). The modeling was performed using Zemax software. We used a non-sequential mode and launch 1 M rays for each LED. The simulation models two LED sources with Lambertian angular distribution, followed by two short length of optical fiber (10 mm) using 2 cylinder object with core and cladding. The small absorbing volume was added to remove ray that escape from optical fiber and increase computation speed. Optical fiber is immerged in a seawater media. Detector is a volume detector with Voxel size of 0.01 mm in x, y and z. Power value of a pixel in the Volume Detector (Watt) correspond 0.0001 mm 2 area, then should be multiplied by 1E4 to get value in W/mm 2 (or 1E7 for mW/mm 2 ). Another detector rectangle is placed at output of one fiber to adjust output power to 0.125 mW. The resulting image ( Figure S5 ) is a linear scale plot with maximum intensity corresponding to 4 mW/mm 2 .
For the constant light or constant darkness experiments, adult CD1 mice that had been electroporated at P0-P1 with the GFAP-GFP and prominin (P2)-mCherry plasmids were transferred to a room either with constant 250-lux light illumination or with constant darkness for 3 or 7 days. The control mice were kept on a normal 12 h/12 h light/dark cycle. For the luzindole experiments, adult CD1 mice electroporated at P0-P1 with the GFAP-GFP and prominin (P2)-mCherry plasmids were injected intraperitoneally with luzindole (10 mg/kg in 2% DMSO) twice a day for 7 days. As melatonin secretion is bimodal, with a peak at 7 p.m. and another peak at midnight ( Nakahara et al., 2003 41. Nakahara, D. ∙ Nakamura, M. ∙ Iigo, M. ... Bimodal circadian secretion of melatonin from the pineal gland in a living CBA mouse Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100 :9584-9589 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ), we injected the mice at 6 p.m. and 11 p.m. The mice in the control group received injections of 2% DMSO. We also injected luzindole during a day, when melatonin level is lower. In these experiments, we injected the mice with luzindole (10 mg/kg in 2% DMSO) twice a day for 7 days, at 9 a.m. and 2 p.m. To increase melatonin levels during the daytime, we injected melatonin (8 mg/kg) at 9 a.m. and 2 p.m. for 7 days. Following the 7-d period, the mice were perfused, and 40-μm-thick brain slices were immunolabelled for Ki67 to assess the number of proliferative GFP+/mCherry+ NSCs.
In order to distinguish between astrocytes and NSCs in adult GFAP-GFP mice, a DNA replication marker (BrdU) was given in the drinking water (1 mg/mL in 0.3% sucrose) for 2 weeks followed by a 3-week “chase” period during which the mice received only water.
FACS of different populations from the adult mouse brain SVZ was performed as previously described ( Beckervordersandforth et al., 2010 7. Beckervordersandforth, R. ∙ Tripathi, P. ∙ Ninkovic, J. ...

Protoc. 2011; 6 :1981-1989 Crossref Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ). The following cell types from hGFAP-GFP animals were sorted: qNSC (hGFAP-GFP+, CD133+, EGFR-; dataset already used in ( Lepko et al., 2019 33. Lepko, T. ∙ Pusch, M. ∙ Müller, T. ... Choroid plexus-derived miR-204 regulates the number of quiescent neural stem cells in the adult brain EMBO J. 2019; 38 :e100481 Crossref Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar )) and aNSCs (hGFAP-GFP+, CD133+, EGFR+). FACS-purified cells were collected and were homogenized in RLT buffer (QIAGEN). Total RNA was extracted using the miRNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer's instructions, including the step for the removal of genomic DNA. An Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer was used to assess RNA quality.
To prepare libraries for RNA-sequencing, cDNA was synthesized from 300 pg of total RNA using a SMART-Seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA Kit for Sequencing (Clontech), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Prior to generating the final library for Illumina sequencing, the Covaris AFA system was used to perform cDNA shearing, resulting in 200-500-bp-long cDNA fragments. The quality and concentration of the sheared cDNA was assessed on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer before preparing the library using MicroPlex Library Preparation Kit v2 (Diagenode). Final libraries were evaluated and quantified using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer, and the concentrations were measured using a Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA Assay Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) before sequencing. The uniquely barcoded libraries were multiplexed onto one lane, and 100-bp paired-end deep sequencing was carried out on a HiSeq 4000 (Illumina) that generated ∼30 million reads per sample. FastQ files were deposited at NCBI Central (accession number pending). Kallisto pipeline ( Bray et al., 2016 11. Bray, N.L. ∙ Pimentel, H. ∙ Melsted, P. ... Near-optimal probabilistic RNA-seq quantification Nat. Biotechnol. 2016; 34 :525-527 Crossref Scopus (5202) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used to quantify the expression of transcripts that are expressed as transcripts per million reads (tpm). To verify the sorting, we analyzed the expression of highly expressed genes in different cellular populations defined using an independent scRNaseq based approach ( Llorens-Bobadilla et al., 2015 36. Llorens-Bobadilla, E. ∙ Zhao, S. ∙ Baser, A. ... Single-cell transcriptomics reveals a population of dormant neural stem cells that become activated upon brain injury Cell Stem Cell. 2015; 17 :329-340 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (510) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The gRNAs were designed and selected using ChopChop online software ( Labun et al., 2019 31. Labun, K. ∙ Montague, T.G. ∙ Krause, M. ... CHOPCHOP v3: expanding the CRISPR web toolbox beyond genome editing Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 :W171-W174 Crossref Scopus (865) PubMed Google Scholar ). We used two different gRNAs to target each gene in order to increase the efficiency of the CRISPR editing. The following gRNA sequences were used: gRNA sequences (5′ −3′) Itpr2-gRNA1 CCTCTGGGTGCACCACACAA Itpr2-gRNA2 ACACGATGTCCCCAATGTAG Control, LacZ-gRNA TGCGAATACGCCCACGCGAT Open table in a new tab
The efficiency of the gRNAs was verified by high-resolution melting curve PCR ( Thomas et al., 2014 52. Thomas, H.R. ∙ Percival, S.M. ∙ Yoder, B.K. ... High-throughput genome editing and phenotyping facilitated by high resolution melting curve analysis PLoS ONE. 2014; 9 :e114632 Crossref Scopus (103) PubMed Google Scholar ) on primary cultures of adult NPCs transfected with above-mentioned plasmids under a CMV promoter. Briefly, the thin layer of SVZ bordering the lateral ventricle, excluding the striatal parenchyma and corpus callosum, was dissected from the SVZ of 8- to 12-week-old C57BL/6 mice. The tissue was minced and was digested in a 0.05% trypsin-EDTA solution, following which an equal volume of soybean trypsin inhibitor was added. After trituration, the resulting single cell suspension was cultured in NeuroCult Basal Medium with NeuroCult Proliferation Supplement (StemCell Technologies). EGF and bFGF (10 ng/mL each; Sigma-Aldrich), and heparin (2 μg/mL; StemCell Technologies) was added to the culture medium.
Genomic DNA was isolated using DNeasy Blood & Tissue kits (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Primers were designed using Primer-Blast software ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast/ ).
The PCR reactions were performed with 5 μL of LightCycler® 480 High Resolution Melting Master (Roche), 0.5 μL of each primer (10 μM), 1.2 μL of MgCl 2 (25 mM), and 2 μL of genomic DNA and was completed with water to 10 μL. The PCR was performed in a LightCycler 480 (Roche) using 96-well plates (Bio-Rad). The amplification started with an initial 5-min denaturation step at 95°C, followed by 48 cycles at 95°C for 10 s, 60°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 25 s. Melting curves were generated over a 65-95 °C range in 0.2°C increments and were analyzed using LightCycler 480 SW1.5.1 software. The following primers were used: HRM Primers (5′-3′) Itpr2-gRNA1-Fw GTGGCTTATGAATGTGGTGATG Itpr2-gRNA1-Rs CTGAACTTCTTGGGTGGGTT Itpr2-gRNA2-Fw GAGCTCACCCTTGCGTGC Itpr2-gRNA2-Rs TGAAGCCATTGACCGAGCCC Open table in a new tab
The animals were deeply anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (12 mg/mL; 0.1 mL per 10 g of body weight) and were perfused intracardially with 0.9% NaCl followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). The brains were collected and were kept overnight in 4% PFA. Sagittal slices (40 μm) were cut using a vibratome (Leica). The brain slices were incubated with the following primary antibodies: mouse (1:500, Life technologies) or chicken anti-GFP (1:500, Aves), rabbit anti-Ki67 (1:500, Abcam), mouse anti-PCNA (1:500, Sigma), mouse anti-GFAP (1:500, Sigma), mouse anti-Mash1 (1:500, BD Bioscience), guinea pig anti-Dcx (1:500, Sigma), rabbit anti-s100β (1:500, Agilent Dako), rat anti-BrdU (1:500, Bio-Rad), and mouse anti-RFP (1:500, BioVision). The antibodies were diluted in 0.5% Triton X-100 and 4% milk prepared in PBS. The brain slices were incubated overnight at 4°C. For PCNA immunolabeling, an antigen retrieval protocol was applied by incubating the sections in Na-citrate solution (pH 9) for 15 min at 80°C. For BrdU immunolabeling, the brain slices were treated with 2 N HCl for 40 min at 37°C to denature the DNA. The corresponding secondary antibodies were used and were applied for 3 h at RT. For proliferation analysis with PCNA, Ki67 and BrdU, the daughter cell doublets were excluded from analysis. For experiments with Twitch2B, adult CD1 mice electroporated with GFAP-Twitch2B at P0-P1 were perfused 8 weeks later, and 40-μm-thick brain slices were immunostained with anti-Ki67. Images were acquired using the CFP excitation wavelength (405 nm), and the fluorescence signals were collected at the CFP and YFP emission wavelengths. The fluorescence signals from the region of interest were calculated as a ratio of YFP to CFP emissions. Fluorescence images were acquired using a confocal microscope (FV 1000; Olympus) with 60x (UPlanSApoN 60x/NA 1.42; Olympus) and 40x (UPlanSApoN 40x/NA 0.90; Olympus) oil and air immersion objectives, respectively.
Six to 10 weeks post-electroporation, the mice were sacrificed, and acute slices were prepared as described previously ( Bakhshetyan and Saghatelyan, 2015 5. Bakhshetyan, K. ∙ Saghatelyan, A. Tracking neuronal migration in adult brain slices Curr. Protoc. Neurosci. 2015; 71 3.28.21-13 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, the mice were anesthetized with ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) and were perfused transcardially with modified oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing (in mM): 210.3 sucrose, 3 KCl, 2 CaCl 2 .2H 2 O, 1.3 MgCl 2 .6H 2 O, 26 NaHCO 3 , 1.25 NaH 2 PO 4 .H 2 O, and 20 glucose. The brains were then quickly removed and 250-μm-thick slices were cut using a vibratome (HM 650V; ThermoFisher Scientific). The slices were kept at 37°C in ACSF containing (in mM): 125 NaCl, 3 KCl, 2 CaCl 2 .2H 2 O, 1.3 MgCl 2 .6H 2 O, 26 NaHCO 3 , 1.25 NaH 2 PO 4 .H 2 O, and 20 glucose under oxygenation for no more than 6-8 h. The acute slices were transferred to the imaging chamber and were continuously superfused with ACSF. Ca 2+ imaging was performed at 31-33°C using a BX61WI (Olympus) upright microscope equipped with motorized z drive, a 40X water immersion objective (NA = 0.8), a CCD camera (CoolSnap HQ), and mercury arc or Xenon illumination lamps. GCaMP6s and Rhod-2 were imaged using 482/35 nm and 562/40 nm excitation filters, and emissions were collected using 536/40 nm and 593/40 nm filters, respectively. The imaging was performed every 30 s for 1-2 h with multiple z stacks (5-9 stacks at 3-μm intervals), except for luzindole experiments when imaging was performed every 10 s for 20-25 min. For pharmacological experiments, the same cells were imaged under baseline conditions for 40-60 min followed by imaging in the presence of different pharmacological compounds for another 40-60 min. For luzindole experiments, we performed imaging only for 20-25 min (10 min at baseline followed by 10-15 min in the presence of luzindole, one acquisition every 10 s) to minimize potential melatonin washout in the acute brain slices by the 1-2 mL/min flow rate of ACSF. The following reagents were used: 2APB (100 μM) to block IP3-sensitive intracellular stores, thapsigargin (3 μM) to inhibit SERCA, luzindole (15 μM) to inhibit melatonin receptors, AP5 (50 μM) to block NMDA receptors, SKF 96365 hydrochloride (25 μM) to block TrpC channels, HC 067047 (10 μM) to block TrpV4 channels and EGF (0.1μg/mL) to increase NSC and progenitor proliferation. For Rhod2-AM experiments in GFAP-hBaccs2 electroporated cells, the slices derived from adult mice electroporated with GFAP-hBaccs2 at P0-P1 were incubated with Rhod2-AM (0.5 μM) for 35-40 min. Baseline fluorescence intensity of Rhod2 was assessed exclusively in hBaccs2+ cells before and after 60 s optogenetic stimulation at 490 nm.
Ca 2+ responses were analyzed using a custom-written script in MATLAB (MathWorks Inc., USA). The images were recorded for the XY positions and were corrected for xy drift using the StackReg ImageJ plugin, as needed. Regions of interest (ROI) were manually drawn around the soma of each cell to extract the GCaMP6s or Rhod2 fluorescence signal. Ca 2+ activity in the processes was not analyzed. Ca 2+ activity was calculated as relative changes in the percentage of ΔF/F = (F-F back )/F back , where F is the GCaMP6 intensity in the ROI and F back is the background signal. To analyze spontaneous Ca 2+ activity in NSCs we used a multiple threshold algorithm ( Danielson et al., 2017 15. Danielson, N.B. ∙ Turi, G.F. ∙ Ladow, M. ... In vivo imaging of dentate gyrus mossy cells in behaving mice Neuron. 2017; 93 :552-559.e4 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (115) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, we first calculated the mean standard deviation (SD) of each Ca 2+ trace, and all peaks with an amplitude greater than 2 times the SD were measured. These peaks were then removed from the Ca 2+ traces, and the mean SD of the Ca 2+ trace was re-calculated to depict events greater than 2 times the new SD. This procedure was repeated another time and allowed us to depict all Ca 2+ events regardless of their amplitudes. Three different thresholds for the detection of Ca 2+ events are shown in Figures by dashed lines. Several thresholds (1xSD, 1.5xSD, 2xSD, 2.5xSD) were empirically tested by visually inspecting Ca 2+ activity.
For the post hoc identification of cells imaged in the acute brain slices, 250-μm-thick slices were fixed in 4% PFA overnight and were pre-permeabilized with methanol and acetone (30 min each at –30°C) prior to immunostaining. The brain slices were incubated with anti-GFP, anti-PCNA, and anti-s100β primary antibodies for CD1 mice electroporated with GCaMP6s plasmid and with anti-Ki67, anti-GFP, and anti-BrdU primary antibodies for GFAP-GFP mice injected with the Rhod2-AM organic Ca 2+ indicator. Rhod2-AM (1 μL of a 1 mM solution in DMSO) was injected into the LV of adult GFAP-GFP mice 1 h prior to the preparation of the acute brain slices at the following coordinates: AP 0.4 mm; ML 0.9 mm, and DV 1.9 and 2.4 mm. The corresponding secondary antibodies were used. Because of the sparse labeling of GFAP-GCaMP6s cells, approximately 80% of the imaged cells were retrieved using a post hoc identification analysis. For the Rhod2-AM experiments, the retrieval rate was lower (approximately 40%) because of the dense labeling of GFAP-GFP and Rhod2-AM. To improve retrieval, a pipette dipped in a 1 mM DiI solution was lowered into the acute slice after the Ca 2+ imaging and before fixation. Imaged cells that were not retrieved by the post hoc identification analysis were discarded.
For the in situ hybridization of MTR1a, MTR1b, GFP, and mCherry, we used RNAscope Multiplex Fluorescent Reagent kits (Advanced Cell Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. In situ hybridization was performed on 15-μm-thick fresh frozen brain slices derived from CD1 mice electroporated with GFAP-GFP and prominin (P2)-mCherry at P0-P1. The frozen brain slices were mounted on slides and were dried for 1 h at –20 °C. They were then incubated in cold 4% PFA for 15 min and were sequentially dehydrated in 50%, 70%, and 100% ethanol solutions for 5 min each at RT. The slides were treated with Protease IV for 30 min at RT for antigen retrieval. The probes were diluted (1:50) and were applied to the slides for 2 h at 40°C. The slides were then incubated with a series of preamplifier and amplifier reagents at 40°C (AMP1 for 30 min, AMP2 for 15 min, AMP3 for 30 min, and AMP4 Alt A for 15 min) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Images were acquired using an inverted Zeiss microscope (LSM 700, AxioObserver) with a 20X air immersion objective (NA: 0.9) or a 63X oil immersion objective (NA: 1.4).
Data are expressed as means ± SEM. The individual values of all experiments are also shown in the corresponding figures. The investigator was blinded to the experimental conditions for the analysis of the percentage of proliferating NSCs after the electroporation of the gRNAs. Ca 2+ activity was determined prior to the post hoc identification of imaged cells and, consequently, the investigator was unaware of whether it reflected the activity of astrocytes, qNSCs, or aNSCs. Statistical significance was determined using an unpaired two-sided Student’s t test, Mann-Whitney U test or one-way ANOVA followed by LSD-Fisher post hoc test, using Statistica software. A paired Student’s t test was used for the pharmacological experiments where the same cells were imaged under baseline conditions and following the addition of the pharmacological compound. Equality of variance for the unpaired t test was verified using the F-test. The exact values of n and its representation (cells, animals) for all experiments are indicated in Tables S1 and S2 . The levels of significance were ∗ p < 0.05, ∗∗ p < 0.01, and ∗∗∗ p < 0.001.
