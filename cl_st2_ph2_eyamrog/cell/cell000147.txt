Title: Ribosome Collisions Trigger General Stress Responses to Regulate Cell Fate


Abstract: Summary

Problems arising during translation of mRNAs lead to ribosome stalling and collisions that trigger a series of quality control events. However, the global cellular response to ribosome collisions has not been explored. Here, we uncover a function for ribosome collisions in signal transduction. Using translation elongation inhibitors and general cellular stress conditions, including amino acid starvation and UV irradiation, we show that ribosome collisions activate the stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) and GCN2-mediated stress response pathways. We show that the MAPKKK ZAK functions as the sentinel for ribosome collisions and is required for immediate early activation of both SAPK (p38/JNK) and GCN2 signaling pathways. Selective ribosome profiling and biochemistry demonstrate that although ZAK generally associates with elongating ribosomes on polysomal mRNAs, it specifically auto-phosphorylates on the minimal unit of colliding ribosomes, the disome. Together, these results provide molecular insights into how perturbation of translational homeostasis regulates cell fate.

Section: Introduction

Cellular stress triggers a wide range of responses, from activation of pathways that promote cell survival to initiation of programmed cell death. Typically, cellular stress responses first allow cells to adapt and recover from the specific stress; and if the stimulatory insult cannot be resolved, they initiate death signaling pathways. The capacity of the cell to mount an appropriate response to environmental or intracellular stress is critical for determining cell fate.
Stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs) are conserved from yeast to mammals and are critical determinants of cell fate in response to multiple environmental insults ( Duch et al., 2012 12. Duch, A. ∙ de Nadal, E. ∙ Posas, F. The p38 and Hog1 SAPKs control cell cycle progression in response to environmental stresses FEBS Lett. 2012; 586 :2925-2931 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kyriakis and Avruch, 2012 36.

Rev. 2012; 92 :689-737 Crossref Scopus (1089) PubMed Google Scholar ). There are two SAPK families in mammals: p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Activation of p38 induces cell-cycle arrest whereas activation of JNK promotes apoptosis ( Darling and Cook, 2014 6. Darling, N.J. ∙ Cook, S.J. The role of MAPK signalling pathways in the response to endoplasmic reticulum stress Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2014; 1843 :2150-2163 Crossref Scopus (313) PubMed Google Scholar ; Duch et al., 2012 12.

The p38 and Hog1 SAPKs control cell cycle progression in response to environmental stresses FEBS Lett. 2012; 586 :2925-2931 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ). In a process referred to as the ribotoxic stress response (RSR), SAPK signaling through p38/JNK is robustly triggered on short timescales (minutes) by agents that target the ribosome to induce elongation distress, including anisomycin (ANS), emetine (EME), and sarcin/ricin ( Iordanov et al., 1997 21. Iordanov, M.S. ∙ Pribnow, D. ∙ Magun, J.L. ... Ribotoxic stress response: activation of the stress-activated protein kinase JNK1 by inhibitors of the peptidyl transferase reaction and by sequence-specific RNA damage to the alpha-sarcin/ricin loop in the 28S rRNA Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17 :3373-3381 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition to ribosome-targeting agents, other studies established that UV irradiation is also a potent activator of the RSR ( Iordanov et al., 1998 22. Iordanov, M.S. ∙ Pribnow, D. ∙ Magun, J.L. ... Ultraviolet radiation triggers the ribotoxic stress response in mammalian cells J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273 :15794-15803 Crossref Scopus (150) PubMed Google Scholar , 2002 23. Iordanov, M.S. ∙ Choi, R.J. ∙ Ryabinina, O.P. ... The UV (Ribotoxic) stress response of human keratinocytes involves the unexpected uncoupling of the Ras-extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling cascade from the activated epidermal growth factor receptor Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22 :5380-5394 Crossref Scopus (87) PubMed Google Scholar ), and it was proposed that ribosomal RNA (rRNA) damage caused by UV irradiation is critical to RSR activation ( Iordanov et al., 1998 22. Iordanov, M.S. ∙ Pribnow, D. ∙ Magun, J.L. ... Ultraviolet radiation triggers the ribotoxic stress response in mammalian cells J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273 :15794-15803 Crossref Scopus (150) PubMed Google Scholar ). Both ANS- and UV-stimulated activation of p38/JNK depend specifically on the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK) ZAK (also known as MAPKKK20 or MLK7) ( Jandhyala et al., 2008 27. Jandhyala, D.M. ∙ Ahluwalia, A. ∙ Obrig, T. ... ZAK: a MAP3Kinase that transduces Shiga toxin- and ricin-induced proinflammatory cytokine expression Cell. Microbiol. 2008; 10 :1468-1477 Crossref Scopus (86) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2005 56. Wang, X. ∙ Mader, M.M. ∙ Toth, J.E. ...

Biol. Chem. 2005; 280 :19298-19305 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, molecular understanding of how ZAK monitors ribotoxic stress in the cell and activates the RSR remains unknown.
A common response of cells to diverse stresses is the repression of global translation initiation. Two commonly used mechanisms for reducing initiation include the phosphorylation of eIF2⍺ by stress-specific kinases and the phosphorylation of 4E-BPs by mTORC1 ( Sonenberg and Hinnebusch, 2009 52. Sonenberg, N. ∙ Hinnebusch, A.G. Regulation of translation initiation in eukaryotes: mechanisms and biological targets Cell. 2009; 136 :731-745 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2449) PubMed Google Scholar ). Four different eIF2⍺ kinases exist in mammals, each initiating the integrated stress response (ISR) to promote cell survival in response to distinct stress conditions—GCN2 by amino acid limitation, PKR by double-stranded RNAs during viral infection, PERK by accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and HRI by heme deprivation. Although there are data indicating that GCN2 phosphorylates eIF2⍺ through sensing uncharged tRNAs that accumulate during amino acid starvation ( Dong et al., 2000 11. Dong, J. ∙ Qiu, H. ∙ Garcia-Barrio, M. ... Uncharged tRNA activates GCN2 by displacing the protein kinase moiety from a bipartite tRNA-binding domain Mol. Cell. 2000; 6 :269-279 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (366) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wek et al., 1989 57. Wek, R.C. ∙ Jackson, B.M. ∙ Hinnebusch, A.G. Juxtaposition of domains homologous to protein kinases and histidyl-tRNA synthetases in GCN2 protein suggests a mechanism for coupling GCN4 expression to amino acid availability Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1989; 86 :4579-4583 Crossref Scopus (226) PubMed Google Scholar ), other studies show that GCN2 is activated by the isolated ribosomal P-stalk ( Harding et al., 2019 17. Harding, H.P. ∙ Ordonez, A. ∙ Allen, F. ... The ribosomal P-stalk couples amino acid starvation to GCN2 activation in mammalian cells eLife. 2019; 8 :e50149 Crossref Scopus (80) PubMed Google Scholar ; Inglis et al., 2019 20. Inglis, A.J. ∙ Masson, G.R. ∙ Shao, S. ... Activation of GCN2 by the ribosomal P-stalk Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2019; 116 :4946-4954 Crossref Scopus (106) PubMed Google Scholar ; Jiménez-Díaz et al., 2013 29. Jiménez-Díaz, A. ∙ Remacha, M. ∙ Ballesta, J.P.G. ... Phosphorylation of initiation factor eIF2 in response to stress conditions is mediated by acidic ribosomal P1/P2 proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae PLoS ONE. 2013; 8 :e84219 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ) and by ribosome stalling independent of uncharged tRNAs ( Ishimura et al., 2016 25. Ishimura, R. ∙ Nagy, G. ∙ Dotu, I. ... Activation of GCN2 kinase by ribosome stalling links translation elongation with translation initiation eLife. 2016; 5 :e14295 Crossref Scopus (119) PubMed Google Scholar ). The degree of GCN2 activation correlates with the severity of ribosome stalling induced by amino acid starvation ( Darnell et al., 2018 7. Darnell, A.M. ∙ Subramaniam, A.R. ∙ O’Shea, E.K. Translational Control through Differential Ribosome Pausing during Amino Acid Limitation in Mammalian Cells Mol. Cell. 2018; 71 :229-243 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (96) PubMed Google Scholar ) consistent with a model wherein GCN2 directly monitors the global status of elongating ribosomes.
Ribosome collisions have been shown to be the key cellular trigger for ribosome-mediated quality control in eukaryotic cells that targets problematic mRNAs ( Yan and Zaher, 2019 60. Yan, L.L. ∙ Zaher, H.S. How do cells cope with RNA damage and its consequences? J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294 :15158-15171 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (92) PubMed Google Scholar ). These pathways serve to minimize the toxic effects of incomplete peptide products generated from incomplete or problematic mRNAs; outputs of these pathways include targeting both the mRNA (by no-go decay [NGD]) and the nascent peptide (by the ribosome-mediated quality control complex [RQC]) for decay ( Brandman and Hegde, 2016 3. Brandman, O. ∙ Hegde, R.S. Ribosome-associated protein quality control. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2016; 23 :7-15 Crossref Scopus (293) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although these pathways effectively manage occasional problems during translation, large-scale perturbations likely overwhelm the quality control machinery which is typically sub-stoichiometric to ribosomes across cell types ( Kulak et al., 2014 35. Kulak, N.A. ∙ Pichler, G. ∙ Paron, I. ... Minimal, encapsulated proteomic-sample processing applied to copy-number estimation in eukaryotic cells Nat. Methods. 2014; 11 :319-324 Crossref Scopus (1155) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Here, we bridge these ideas and identify elongating, colliding ribosomes as key communicators of cellular homeostasis, alerting cells to general stress and activating pathways to respond to this stress. More specifically, we show that activation of eIF2⍺ and SAPKs (p38/JNK), as induced by standard translation elongation inhibitors such as ANS and EME, is triggered by colliding ribosomes that have overwhelmed the quality control machinery. Activation of these two distinct stress response pathways depends on the MAPKKK ZAK. ZAK associates normally with elongating, transiently colliding, ribosomes, but under broad cellular stress, auto-phosphorylates on abundant more stable colliding ribosomes and activates downstream SAPK signaling pathways. Finally, we show that standard physiological stressors, including amino acid starvation and UV irradiation, strongly activate these same signaling pathways.

Section: Results

Although the RSR is known to be triggered by elongation distress during translation, the molecular mechanisms associated with activation have been obscure ( Iordanov et al., 1997 21. Iordanov, M.S. ∙ Pribnow, D. ∙ Magun, J.L. ... Ribotoxic stress response: activation of the stress-activated protein kinase JNK1 by inhibitors of the peptidyl transferase reaction and by sequence-specific RNA damage to the alpha-sarcin/ricin loop in the 28S rRNA Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17 :3373-3381 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). In light of recent studies implicating ribosome collisions in mRNA-specific quality control (QC), we first asked whether the RSR is activated by generally slow elongating ribosomes or instead by ribosome collisions. Ribosome collisions can be broadly induced in cells using translation elongation inhibitors such as ANS and EME, as previously reported ( Juszkiewicz et al., 2018 31. Juszkiewicz, S. ∙ Chandrasekaran, V. ∙ Lin, Z. ... ZNF598 Is a Quality Control Sensor of Collided Ribosomes Mol. Cell. 2018; 72 :469-481 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (229) PubMed Google Scholar ; Simms et al., 2017 51. Simms, C.L. ∙ Yan, L.L. ∙ Zaher, H.S. Ribosome Collision Is Critical for Quality Control during No-Go Decay Mol. Cell. 2017; 68 :361-373 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (184) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, we established conditions for each compound where high concentrations of inhibitor caused uniform stalling of ribosomes on mRNAs, while intermediate concentrations stalled only a subset of ribosomes, leading to widespread ribosome collisions between stalled and trailing ribosomes ( Figure 1 A). We directly monitored ribosome collisions by treating cellular lysates with a non-specific RNase (RNase A) and resolved the resulting ribosome population on a sucrose gradient. Although the majority of polysomes are collapsed to monosomes in all treatments, a minor fraction of ribosomes resists RNase treatment and sediments as disomes in unstressed cells ( Figure 1 B, black) ( Arpat et al., 2019 1. Arpat, A.B. ∙ Liechti, A. ∙ De Matos, M. ... Transcriptome-wide sites of collided ribosomes reveal principles of translational pausing bioRxiv. 2019; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ; Han et al., 2020 16. Han, P. ∙ Shichino, Y. ∙ Schneider-Poetsch, T. ... Genome-wide Survey of Ribosome Collision Cell Rep. 2020; 31 :107610 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (87) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wolin and Walter, 1988 58. Wolin, S.L. ∙ Walter, P. Ribosome pausing and stacking during translation of a eukaryotic mRNA EMBO J. 1988; 7 :3559-3569 Crossref Scopus (366) PubMed Google Scholar ). Importantly, however, we observe the strongest accumulation of disomes at the intermediate ( Figure 1 B, orange) but not the high concentration ( Figure 1 B, gray) of ANS as compared to the unstressed sample. Similar titrations performed for EME, a translation elongation inhibitor targeting a distinct step in elongation, also reveal an increase in colliding ribosomes ( Figure S1 A). These data serve as a biochemical read out for the relative amount of colliding ribosomes under different cellular conditions.
We next titrated the elongation inhibitors to determine whether activation of the SAPK signaling pathway (monitored through the phosphorylation of p38 or JNK) was sensitive to concentration. Strikingly, maximal levels of p38/JNK phosphorylation are observed in HEK293 cells at intermediate but not at high concentrations of ANS ( Figure 1 C). Importantly, high concentrations of ANS neither reduce cell viability over the course of the experiment (15–30 min) ( Figure S1 B) nor interfere with p38/JNK phosphorylation activated through tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-⍺) ( Figure S1 C), a cytokine that activates p38/JNK through a distinct mechanism ( Kant et al., 2011 32. Kant, S. ∙ Swat, W. ∙ Zhang, S. ... TNF-stimulated MAP kinase activation mediated by a Rho family GTPase signaling pathway Genes Dev. 2011; 25 :2069-2078 Crossref Scopus (104) PubMed Google Scholar ). We observe the same trends of optimal activation of p38/JNK phosphorylation at intermediate doses of EME ( Figure 1 D) and in multiple cell lines ( Figures S1 D and S1E). As additional validation that actively elongating ribosomes are required for the accumulation of collisions, we find that pretreating cells with high-dose EME to uniformly stall all ribosomes prevents p38 phosphorylation by subsequent addition of an intermediate dose of ANS ( Figure 1 E).
Problematic mRNA sequences such as extended poly(A) stretches are also known to cause ribosome collisions ( Chandrasekaran et al., 2019 4. Chandrasekaran, V. ∙ Juszkiewicz, S. ∙ Choi, J. ... Mechanism of ribosome stalling during translation of a poly(A) tail Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2019; 26 :1132-1140 Crossref Scopus (87) PubMed Google Scholar ; Juszkiewicz et al., 2018 31. Juszkiewicz, S. ∙ Chandrasekaran, V. ∙ Lin, Z. ... ZNF598 Is a Quality Control Sensor of Collided Ribosomes Mol. Cell. 2018; 72 :469-481 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (229) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tesina et al., 2020 53. Tesina, P. ∙ Lessen, L.N. ∙ Buschauer, R. ... Molecular mechanism of translational stalling by inhibitory codon combinations and poly(A) tracts EMBO J. 2020; 39 :e103365 Crossref Scopus (88) PubMed Google Scholar ). We asked whether overexpression (OE) of collision-inducing reporter constructs with either no stalling sequence (A 0 ) or a long poly(A) sequence (A 60 ) would activate SAPK signaling. The reporter includes 2A skipping sequences that allow nascent GFP to escape degradation by the RQC and to be used to report on mRNA levels ( Figure 1 F, top). We observe increased levels of p38 phosphorylation in A 60 -transfected cells compared to either vector-only or A 0 -transfected cells ( Figure 1 F, bottom); the modest increase in p38 phosphorylation in A 0 -transfected cells likely results from ribosome collisions induced at the 2A skipping sequences that we document through ribosome profiling ( Figure S1 F). Together, these multiple lines of evidence support a model in which colliding ribosomes, and not slow individual elongating ribosomes, trigger the RSR in mammalian cells.
A previous study identified the MAPKKK—ZAK—as the upstream kinase connecting ribotoxic stress to SAPK activation ( Wang et al., 2005 56. Wang, X. ∙ Mader, M.M. ∙ Toth, J.E. ... Complete inhibition of anisomycin and UV radiation but not cytokine induced JNK and p38 activation by an aryl-substituted dihydropyrrolopyrazole quinoline and mixed lineage kinase 7 small interfering RNA J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280 :19298-19305 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although ZAK has two major isoforms, ⍺ and β, the isoform that contributes to the activation of the RSR remains unknown. We generated a ZAK knockout (KO) cell line using CRISPR/Cas9 and then complemented the KO line with either the ⍺ or β isoform cDNA. Consistent with earlier studies, we show that ZAK is required for rapid p38 phosphorylation on treatment with an intermediate dose of ANS ( Figure 2 A, lanes 6–7). Cells complemented with ZAK⍺ but not ZAKβ are competent to trigger p38 phosphorylation ( Figure 2 A, compare lanes 8 and 10), suggesting that important determinants of activation lie within the 468 amino acid (aa) long C-terminal tail of ZAK⍺, as recently shown ( Vind et al., 2020 55. Vind, A.C. ∙ Snieckute, G. ∙ Blasius, M. ... ZAKα Recognizes Stalled Ribosomes through Partially Redundant Sensor Domains Mol. Cell. 2020; 78 :700-713 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (72) PubMed Google Scholar ). Next, we used mutational analysis to define regions of ZAK⍺ responsible for activation. Although an ATP-binding defective variant of ZAK⍺, K45M ( Gross et al., 2002 15. Gross, E.A. ∙ Callow, M.G. ∙ Waldbaum, L. ... MRK, a mixed lineage kinase-related molecule that plays a role in γ-radiation-induced cell cycle arrest J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277 :13873-13882 Crossref Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ), fails to activate p38 phosphorylation upon ANS stimulation ( Figure 2 A, lanes 8–9), mutation of three different motifs within the C-terminal tail including a leucine-zipper (LZ) domain, a sterile alpha motif (SAM), and a cryptic RNA-binding motif had no impact on p38 activation ( Figure S2 A). Given that there is no detailed structural information on the ZAK⍺ C-terminal tail, we systematically generated ZAK⍺ C-terminal deletions. Deletion of the C-terminal 80 aa (ZAK⍺ 1–720) slightly reduces the levels of p38 phosphorylation ( Figure 2 B, lanes 1–2 and 4–5), whereas deletion of the C-terminal 151 aa (ZAK⍺ 1–649) completely abolishes p38 phosphorylation ( Figure 2 B, lanes 3 and 6). Taken together, we define a region of ZAK⍺ as critical for activation of the RSR.
Given that ZAK⍺ is a MAPKKK, a class of molecule that typically functions through autophosphorylation events ( Rey et al., 2016 46. Rey, C. ∙ Faustin, B. ∙ Mahouche, I. ... The MAP3K ZAK, a novel modulator of ERK-dependent migration, is upregulated in colorectal cancer Oncogene. 2016; 35 :3190-3200 Crossref Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ), we asked whether ribosome collisions promote ZAK⍺ autophosphorylation. We first probed the phosphorylation status of ZAK⍺ as a function of elongation inhibitor concentration using Phos-tag gels that retard the migration of phosphorylated proteins ( Kinoshita et al., 2009 34. Kinoshita, E. ∙ Kinoshita-Kikuta, E. ∙ Koike, T. Separation and detection of large phosphoproteins using Phos-tag SDS-PAGE Nat. Protoc. 2009; 4 :1513-1521 Crossref Scopus (300) PubMed Google Scholar ). For both endogenous ZAK⍺ and ZAK⍺-FLAG OE ( Figure S2 B), ZAK⍺ phosphorylation is dramatically increased at intermediate but not high doses of ANS ( Figures 2 C and S2 C); the phosphorylation status of shifted ZAK⍺ was validated by its sensitivity to phosphatase treatment ( Figure S2 D). We observe similar, albeit less robust, phosphorylation of ZAK⍺ on treatment with intermediate doses of EME ( Figure 2 D). Observed differences in the amplitude and pattern of ZAK⍺ phosphorylation with these different triggers (ANS versus EME) may impact downstream output from the signaling pathways.
We next asked whether ZAK⍺ auto-phosphorylates as a mechanism for activation. First, ZAK⍺ phosphorylation was completely abolished in cells that only express the ATP-binding defective variant K45M ( Figure 2 E), as previously shown ( Rey et al., 2016 46. Rey, C. ∙ Faustin, B. ∙ Mahouche, I. ... The MAP3K ZAK, a novel modulator of ERK-dependent migration, is upregulated in colorectal cancer Oncogene. 2016; 35 :3190-3200 Crossref Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ); thus, the kinase activity of ZAK⍺ is essential for its own phosphorylation. To address whether ZAK⍺ functions in cis or trans , we supplied wild-type (WT) or K45M epitope-tagged ZAK⍺ to cells carrying endogenous ZAK⍺ and followed the phosphorylation status of the exogenous ZAK⍺ variant. These data show that exogenous ZAK⍺ is only phosphorylated when its own kinase domain is intact ( Figure 2 F); importantly, the exogenous ZAK⍺ is expressed at lower levels than the endogenous ZAK⍺ (exogenous/endogenous = ∼0.35) thus increasing the likelihood of trans activation were it to happen. These data provide compelling evidence that ZAK⍺ functions in cis to activate the RSR.
We next asked whether ZAK⍺ directly associates with elongating ribosomes. Polysome profiling followed by western blot analysis reveals that substantial amounts of both ZAK⍺ and ZAK⍺-K45M associate with monosomes and polysomes, whereas ZAKβ does not ( Figure 3 A). Although the C-terminal 80 aa deletion construct (ZAK⍺ 1–720) shows somewhat reduced affinity to polysomes, the C-terminal 151 aa deletion construct (ZAK⍺ 1–649) fails to co-migrate with polysomes and predominantly associates with free mRNPs ( Figure 3 B). The correlation between polysome association of ZAK⍺ and p38 activation argues for direct binding interactions with the ribosome being critical to pathway activation.
We next asked whether the association of ZAK⍺ with ribosomes changes upon ANS stimulation and found that ZAK⍺ associates with monosomes and polysomes independent of stimulation at the intermediate or high dose of ANS ( Figure 3 C). If our model that ZAK⍺ senses ribosome collisions and activates the RSR is correct, then we would predict that ZAK⍺ preferentially associates with colliding ribosomes relative to monosomes. When polysomes were collapsed by RNase treatment ( Figure 3 D, top panel), ZAK⍺ preferentially co-sediments with disomes ( Figure 3 D, compare fractions 5–7), independent of ANS dose. We suspect that the deep sedimentation of ZAK⍺ ( Figure 3 C) reflects interactions of ZAK⍺ either with single elongating ribosomes or with the ubiquitous transient ribosome collisions occurring in cells ( Figure 1 B). We used Phos-tag gels to monitor ZAK⍺ phosphorylation and found strong enrichment of phosphorylated ZAK⍺ co-sedimenting with RNase-resistant disomes ( Figure 3 E, untreated, intermediate, and high ANS, fractions 6), although note that the majority (∼70%) of the monosome-associated ZAK⍺ species is unphosphorylated in untreated and high-dose ANS conditions ( Figure 3 E, untreated and high ANS, fractions 4). We also observed free and monosome-associated highly phosphorylated ZAK⍺ in cells stimulated with intermediate-dose ANS ( Figure 3 E, intermediate ANS, fractions 1–4), consistent with a recent report that phosphorylation of ZAK⍺ reduces affinity for ribosomes ( Vind et al., 2020 55. Vind, A.C. ∙ Snieckute, G. ∙ Blasius, M. ... ZAKα Recognizes Stalled Ribosomes through Partially Redundant Sensor Domains Mol. Cell. 2020; 78 :700-713 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (72) PubMed Google Scholar ). Given that SAPKs do not associate with polysomes ( Kim et al., 2019 33. Kim, T.-S. ∙ Kim, H.D. ∙ Park, Y.J. ... JNK activation induced by ribotoxic stress is initiated from 80S monosomes but not polysomes BMB Rep. 2019; 52 :502-507 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ), we propose that ZAK⍺ dissociates from colliding disomes when phosphorylated to activate downstream signaling.
To further define ZAK⍺-ribosome association, we performed selective ribosome profiling ( Oh et al., 2011 42. Oh, E. ∙ Becker, A.H. ∙ Sandikci, A. ... Selective ribosome profiling reveals the cotranslational chaperone action of trigger factor in vivo Cell. 2011; 147 :1295-1308 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (340) PubMed Google Scholar ) in ZAK⍺-FLAG OE cells ( Figure S3 A). Consistent with polysome profiles ( Figures 3 D and 3E), we observed enrichment of disome footprints (average length ∼65 nt) in ZAK⍺ immunoprecipitation (IP) samples ( Figure S3 B). Recent reports of disome profiling indicate that ribosome collisions occur preferentially at stop codons and at certain peptide motifs, even in unstressed cells ( Han et al., 2020 16. Han, P. ∙ Shichino, Y. ∙ Schneider-Poetsch, T. ... Genome-wide Survey of Ribosome Collision Cell Rep. 2020; 31 :107610 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (87) PubMed Google Scholar ). We see strong enrichment of ZAK⍺ at stop codons throughout the transcriptome including, for example, the TXNRD1 and RPS13 mRNAs ( Figures S3 C and S3D). We observe an overall ∼3-fold enrichment of ZAK⍺-bound disome footprints at stop codons transcriptome-wide ( Figure 3 F). In addition, ZAK⍺ preferentially associates with colliding disomes at known problematic peptide motifs (e.g., P-P and P-D dipeptides) known to induce ribosome stalling and collisions ( Han et al., 2020 16. Han, P. ∙ Shichino, Y. ∙ Schneider-Poetsch, T. ... Genome-wide Survey of Ribosome Collision Cell Rep. 2020; 31 :107610 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (87) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures S3 E and S3F).
Ribosome collisions trigger mRNA-specific quality control events downstream of recognition of a composite ribosome interface by the E3 ubiquitin ligase ZNF598 ( Juszkiewicz et al., 2018 31. Juszkiewicz, S. ∙ Chandrasekaran, V. ∙ Lin, Z. ... ZNF598 Is a Quality Control Sensor of Collided Ribosomes Mol. Cell. 2018; 72 :469-481 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (229) PubMed Google Scholar ). Using cell lines lacking ZNF598, we find that p38 activation remains sensitive to ANS stimulation and is more potent in general ( Figure 3 G). This increase in p38 activation might result from overall increases in the levels of colliding ribosomes in ZNF598 KO cells ( Garzia et al., 2017 13. Garzia, A. ∙ Jafarnejad, S.M. ∙ Meyer, C. ...

Cellular stresses typically downregulate translation initiation to allow cellular recovery through activation of specific gene expression programs. Recent findings by Ishimura et al. (2014) 24. Ishimura, R. ∙ Nagy, G. ∙ Dotu, I. ... Ribosome stalling induced by mutation of a CNS-specific tRNA causes neurodegeneration Science. 2014; 345 :455-459 Crossref Scopus (312) PubMed Google Scholar show that ribosome stalling induces eIF2⍺ phosphorylation by GCN2 in an uncharged-tRNA independent manner in mice harboring mutations in an Arg-tRNA AGA isodecoder and the putative ribosome rescue factor GTPBP2. Reanalysis of ribosome profiling data from these mice reveals stacked (i.e., colliding) ribosomes upstream of pausing sites at AGA codons ( Figure S4 A), suggesting a potential role for collisions as the trigger of GCN2 in these earlier experiments. We asked whether ribosome collisions might trigger eIF2⍺ phosphorylation. Similar to the patterns observed for p38/JNK phosphorylation induced by ribosome collisions ( Figure 1 C), we see maximal levels of eIF2⍺ phosphorylation at intermediate doses of ANS ( Figure 4 A); importantly, mTOR phosphorylation was unaffected by these same treatments. Pretreatment of cells with GCN2 inhibitor, but not PERK inhibitor, abolishes the eIF2⍺ phosphorylation induced by the intermediate dose of ANS ( Figure 4 B, compare lanes 1–4); GCN2 knockdown by short hairpin RNA (shRNA) similarly shows reduced levels of eIF2⍺ phosphorylation upon stimulation ( Figure S4 B). Moreover, eIF2⍺ phosphorylation does not occur through feedback regulation mediated through p38 because activation is insensitive to p38 inhibitor ( Figure 4 B, compare lanes 2 and 5). We observe similar trends for maximal eIF2⍺ phosphorylation at intermediate levels of ANS in yeast ( Figure S4 C) where only one eIF2⍺ kinase—GCN2—exists. As the other eIF2⍺ kinases respond to cellular stresses not directly connected to protein synthesis, a role for GCN2 in ribosome collision-mediated ISR activation makes considerable sense.
Recent interactome surveys revealed that ZAK⍺ co-localizes with GCN1, GCN20, and other factors implicated in ribosome-mediated quality control such as ZNF598 and ASCC3 ( Figure S5 ). We asked whether ZAK⍺ is critical for GCN2-mediated eIF2⍺ phosphorylation induced by ribosome collisions. Indeed, under intermediate doses of ANS, we find that ZAK KO cells show marked reductions in eIF2⍺ phosphorylation as compared to WT cells ( Figure 4 C). Complementation analyses show that reduction in eIF2⍺ phosphorylation was restored by ZAK⍺ and ZAK⍺-K45M, but not ZAKβ ( Figure 4 D). Given that both ZAK⍺ and ZAK⍺-K45M associate with ribosomes ( Figure 3 A), we hypothesize that the role of ZAK⍺ in this case may be structural or binding-related rather than catalytic. We provide physical evidence to support this hypothesis using polysome profiling to show that GCN1, a GCN2 activator, co-sediments with RNase-resistant disomes; moreover, GCN1-disome association was diminished in ZAK KO cells ( Figure 4 E, lanes 6 and 7 in ZAK KO compared to WT). Although we do not capture GCN2 or GCN20 binding to colliding ribosomes, their association may be transient and/or compromised by RNase treatment. Our results suggest that colliding ribosomes function as a common platform for GCN2- and ZAK⍺-mediated signaling events.
We next performed cellular growth-based CRISPR/Cas9 screens ( Shalem et al., 2014 49. Shalem, O. ∙ Sanjana, N.E. ∙ Hartenian, E. ... Genome-Scale CRISPR-Cas9 Knockout Screening in Human Cells Science. 2014; 343 :84-87 Crossref Scopus (3558) PubMed Google Scholar ) under two different intermediate doses of ANS to systematically explore how mammalian cells survive stresses that induce global ribosome collisions ( Figure S6 A). We infected K562 cells with single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeting each known gene (19,114 genes) and selected for growth under different ANS regimes; after selection, we deep-sequenced the remaining sgRNAs to identify genes that promote cell survival or cell death.
Although overall trends observed in these two screens were similar, some different genes emerged as most critical in these two regimes ( Figures S6 B and S6C). Genes implicated in reducing cell survival in the presence of the higher dose of ANS include ZAK, BAX, BAK1, and ∼54 other genes enriched with high statistical significance ( Figure S6 B; Table S1 ). Gene ontology analysis shows strong enrichment for genes implicated in apoptosis, RNA polymerase III transcription, and tRNA metabolism ( Figure S6 D). Identification of ZAK and apoptosis-related genes is readily reconciled with earlier observations that activation of ZAK⍺ leads to JNK signaling that promotes apoptosis through the BAX/BAK-dependent pathway ( Lei and Davis, 2003 37. Lei, K. ∙ Davis, R.J. JNK phosphorylation of Bim-related members of the Bcl2 family induces Bax-dependent apoptosis Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100 :2432-2437 Crossref Scopus (929) PubMed Google Scholar ). We further assessed cell death under ANS treatment and found that ZAK KO completely abolished apoptosis; this loss in responsiveness to ANS is rescued by complementation with ZAK⍺ but not ZAK⍺-K45M ( Figure S6 E).
In the screen performed at the lower concentration of ANS, genes implicated in apoptosis are again enriched (pink dots) in selection for increased survival ( Figure S6 C). However, we identified 14 genes that are depleted (red dots) in the screen, indicating that they normally increase survival upon ANS treatment, including p38⍺ (MAPK14) and GCN20 (ABCF3) ( Figure S6 C; Table S2 ). p38⍺ is known to negatively regulate JNK to promote cell survival ( Miura et al., 2018 41. Miura, H. ∙ Kondo, Y. ∙ Matsuda, M. ... Cell-to-Cell Heterogeneity in p38-Mediated Cross-Inhibition of JNK Causes Stochastic Cell Death Cell Rep. 2018; 24 :2658-2668 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ) thus likely explaining the de-enrichment of p38⍺ sgRNA. GCN20 belongs to the regulatory complex GCN1/20 for the eIF2⍺ kinase GCN2 and is required for eIF2⍺ phosphorylation in yeast and worms ( Hirose and Horvitz, 2014 18. Hirose, T. ∙ Horvitz, H.R. The translational regulators GCN-1 and ABCF-3 act together to promote apoptosis in C. elegans PLoS Genet. 2014; 10 :e1004512 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ; Vazquez de Aldana et al., 1995 54. Vazquez de Aldana, C.R. ∙ Marton, M.J. ∙ Hinnebusch, A.G. GCN20, a novel ATP binding cassette protein, and GCN1 reside in a complex that mediates activation of the eIF-2 alpha kinase GCN2 in amino acid-starved cells EMBO J. 1995; 14 :3184-3199 Crossref Scopus (137) PubMed Google Scholar ). In light of our data indicating that colliding ribosomes activate GCN2 in a ZAK-dependent manner, deletion of this pathway for eIF2⍺ phosphorylation would effectively increase ribosome collisions, leading to increased p38/JNK activation and cell death. Together, these CRISPR screen results provide strong support for our data indicating that ribosome collisions trigger multiple distinct stress response pathways that determine cell fate.
We next evaluated the implications of our mechanistic insights into ribosome collision-induced stress activation for more general cellular stresses. Recent studies showed that amino acid starvation could induce codon-specific ribosome stalling and collisions ( Darnell et al., 2018 7. Darnell, A.M. ∙ Subramaniam, A.R. ∙ O’Shea, E.K. Translational Control through Differential Ribosome Pausing during Amino Acid Limitation in Mammalian Cells Mol. Cell. 2018; 71 :229-243 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (96) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that when glutamine levels in the media were reduced, the levels of p38 phosphorylation increased accordingly ( Figure 5 A, lanes 2–4). We noted, however, that this activation was modest in comparison to that seen with intermediate doses of ANS ( Figure 5 A, lane 1). Because amino acid starvation induces eIF2⍺ phosphorylation through GCN2, and a consequent block on translation initiation, we reasoned that this response would decrease ribosome collisions. When we instead pretreat starved cells with ISRIB, a compound known to block the ISR, thus allowing ongoing efficient translation initiation ( Sidrauski et al., 2013 50. Sidrauski, C. ∙ Acosta-Alvear, D. ∙ Khoutorsky, A. ... Pharmacological brake-release of mRNA translation enhances cognitive memory eLife. 2013; 2 :e00498 Crossref Scopus (458) PubMed Google Scholar ), we see an increase in RNase-resistant disomes ( Figure S7 A) and a concomitant increase in p38 phosphorylation ( Figure 5 A, lanes 5–7).
We next asked whether ZAK⍺ and its phosphorylation are necessary for p38 activation in response to amino acid starvation. First, phosphorylation of p38 under glutamine starvation strongly depends on ZAK ( Figure 5 B). Second, ZAK⍺ phosphorylation increases slightly when cells were grown in media simply depleted for glutamine ( Figure 5 C, lanes 2–4), and is further increased when starved cells are pretreated with ISRIB ( Figure 5 C, lanes 5–7). These results point to a role for ZAK⍺ in sensing cellular amino acid levels through ribosome collisions to activate SAPK signaling.
Although uncharged tRNA can function as a direct activator of GCN2 ( Berlanga et al., 2006 2. Berlanga, J.J. ∙ Ventoso, I. ∙ Harding, H.P. ... Antiviral effect of the mammalian translation initiation factor 2α kinase GCN2 against RNA viruses EMBO J. 2006; 25 :1730-1740 Crossref Scopus (152) PubMed Google Scholar ), we wondered whether ZAK⍺ and ribosome collisions might play an additional role under amino acid starvation. We observed marked increases in eIF2⍺ phosphorylation under glutamine starvation and a further increase in the presence of ISRIB ( Figure 5 D, lanes 1–3). Although the levels of eIF2⍺ phosphorylation seen under simple glutamine starvation in ZAK KO cells remain similar to those observed in WT cells ( Figure 5 D, lanes 2 and 5), however, we observed strong dependence of eIF2⍺ phosphorylation on ZAK in starved cells pretreated with ISRIB ( Figures 5 D, lanes 3 and 6, and S7 A). We propose that ZAK⍺ is involved specifically in the ribosome-mediated pathway for GCN2 activation that depends on ribosome collisions, but not in GCN2-mediated eIF2⍺ phosphorylation by free uncharged-tRNAs. These observations are consistent with the existence of two pathways for GCN2-mediated eIF2⍺ phosphorylation. One pathway depends simply on free uncharged-tRNAs ( Berlanga et al., 2006 2. Berlanga, J.J. ∙ Ventoso, I. ∙ Harding, H.P. ... Antiviral effect of the mammalian translation initiation factor 2α kinase GCN2 against RNA viruses EMBO J. 2006; 25 :1730-1740 Crossref Scopus (152) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wek et al., 1989 57.

Sci. USA. 1989; 86 :4579-4583 Crossref Scopus (226) PubMed Google Scholar ) and is unaffected by ZAK activity. A second pathway depends on ZAK-enhanced ribosome collision-mediated interactions with GCN complex ( Inglis et al., 2019 20. Inglis, A.J. ∙ Masson, G.R. ∙ Shao, S. ...

UV irradiation induces the RSR and eIF2⍺ phosphorylation on short timescales (minutes) ( Deng et al., 2002 9. Deng, J. ∙ Harding, H.P. ∙ Raught, B. ... Activation of GCN2 in UV-irradiated cells inhibits translation Curr. Biol. 2002; 12 :1279-1286 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (231) PubMed Google Scholar ; Iordanov et al., 1998 22. Iordanov, M.S. ∙ Pribnow, D. ∙ Magun, J.L. ... Ultraviolet radiation triggers the ribotoxic stress response in mammalian cells J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273 :15794-15803 Crossref Scopus (150) PubMed Google Scholar ). For the RSR, it was proposed that damage of rRNAs by UV irradiation causes translation elongation distress ( Iordanov et al., 1998 22. Iordanov, M.S. ∙ Pribnow, D. ∙ Magun, J.L. ... Ultraviolet radiation triggers the ribotoxic stress response in mammalian cells J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273 :15794-15803 Crossref Scopus (150) PubMed Google Scholar ); although these studies provided strong evidence that rRNA damage occurs, it seems unlikely that a majority of this damage would be consequential to ribosome function.
DNA damage response pathways are triggered by UV irradiation that induces formation of thymine dimers or 6-4 photoproducts in DNA ( Ciccia and Elledge, 2010 5. Ciccia, A. ∙ Elledge, S.J. The DNA damage response: making it safe to play with knives Mol. Cell. 2010; 40 :179-204 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (3247) PubMed Google Scholar ). Given that UV irradiation induces pyrimidine dimers not only in DNA but also in RNA ( Jäckle and Kalthoff, 1978 26. Jäckle, H. ∙ Kalthoff, K. Photoreactivation of RNA in UV-irradiated insect eggs (Smittia sp., Chironomidae, Diptera) I. Photosensitized production and light-dependent disappearance of pyrimidine dimers Photochem. Photobiol. 1978; 27 :309-315 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ), we wondered whether global mRNA damage induced by UV irradiation leads to transcriptome-wide ribosome collisions and consequent ZAK⍺-dependent p38/JNK and eIF2⍺ phosphorylation.
To test these ideas, we first used polysome profiling to monitor ribosome collisions upon UV irradiation and observed increased RNase-resistant disomes in UV-irradiated cells ( Figure 6 A). To gain higher resolution into ribosome dynamics in vivo , we performed ribosome profiling experiments with untreated and UV-irradiated cells. Our previous studies have defined two distinct sizes of ribosome-protected footprints (RPFs) in mammalian cells: long footprints (∼31 nt) representing ribosomes with an occupied A site (predominantly in a pre-translocation state) and short footprints (∼22 nt) representing those with an open A site (awaiting tRNA selection) ( Wu et al., 2019 59. Wu, C.C.-C. ∙ Zinshteyn, B. ∙ Wehner, K.A. ... High-Resolution Ribosome Profiling Defines Discrete Ribosome Elongation States and Translational Regulation during Cellular Stress Mol. Cell. 2019; 73 :959-970 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (151) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S7 B). In UV-irradiated cells, we observe a marked increase in short RPFs and a concomitant reduction in long RPFs compared to untreated cells ( Figure 6 B). These data show that UV-irradiation globally increases the number of ribosomes trapped in a state waiting to decode the next aminoacyl-tRNA.
These same ribosome profiling libraries allowed us to define the sites at which ribosomes are disproportionately stalled in UV-irradiated cells. We computed ribosome occupancies of the short RPFs at all 61 sense codons and asked which codons are enriched in UV-irradiated samples. First, we observed a striking loss in the correlation of codon occupancies for the short footprints in UV-irradiated cells compared to untreated cells ( Figures 6 C and S7 C), indicating that UV irradiation drastically perturbs the decoding step of translation elongation. Strikingly, codons containing two adjacent pyrimidines were disproportionately occupied by ribosomes in the UV-treated samples ( Figure 6 C); we note that these calculations will underestimate pausing that occurs on pyrimidine dimers that are shared, for example, by two adjacent codons (e.g., GGU-UAC). When we aligned ribosomes at CUU codons ( Figure 6 D), we observed accumulation of ribosomes at those codons but also ∼30 and ∼60 nt upstream of CUU codons as anticipated by the phasing of ribosome collisions.
We next explored the dependence of the RSR and eIF2⍺ phosphorylation on ZAK; indeed, both p38/JNK and eIF2⍺ phosphorylation are activated by UV irradiation in a ZAK-dependent manner ( Figure 6 E). We also see strong activation of ZAK⍺ under these same conditions ( Figure S7 D), and the same dependence on the kinase activity of ZAK⍺ for activation of the SAPKs ( Figure S7 E). In addition, when we trap elongating ribosomes by pretreatment with high concentrations of ANS or EME ( Figures 1 C and D), p38 phosphorylation induced by UV irradiation is abrogated ( Figure S7 F). These data provide compelling evidence that UV irradiation induces mRNA damage leading to ribosome collisions and thus activates general stress responses through ZAK.
If our model that ribosome collisions induced by damaged mRNA activates ZAK⍺ and GCN2 under UV irradiation is correct, then DNA and rRNA damage should both be dispensable for activation of the SAPKs and GCN2-mediated eIF2⍺ phosphorylation. To test this, we exposed in vitro -transcribed EGFP mRNA (5′-capped and 3′-polyadenylated) to UV irradiation (or not) and then transfected these mRNAs directly into cells and monitored activation of ZAK⍺ and the downstream pathways. We observed potent activation of ZAK⍺ and both downstream branches of signaling ( Figure 6 F) only in the cells transfected with the UV-irradiated sample. EGFP protein output from UV-irradiated mRNA decreased drastically, likely reflecting reduced translation on damaged mRNA. These results show that mRNA damage induced by UV irradiation is sufficient to activate ZAK⍺ and the downstream signaling pathways, independent of any contribution from nuclear DNA-activated pathways or ribosome damage per se.

Section: Discussion

A major challenge for cells on encountering stress is to mount a measured response that balances life-or-death cell fate decisions through activation of survival or apoptotic gene expression programs. Here, we show that the extremely abundant elongating ribosomes in the cytoplasm function as key sensors of general cellular stress. It is appealing that the ribosome could function as such a broad sensor given recent tomographic reconstructions of yeast cells revealing extremely abundant ribosomes (20% of the cell volume) ( Delarue et al., 2018 8. Delarue, M. ∙ Brittingham, G.P. ∙ Pfeffer, S. ... mTORC1 Controls Phase Separation and the Biophysical Properties of the Cytoplasm by Tuning Crowding Cell. 2018; 174 :338-349 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (244) PubMed Google Scholar ). More specifically, our work reveals a mechanism by which ribosome collisions function as a key molecular trigger for the SAPKs (p38/JNK) and GCN2 ( Figure 7 A), leading to activation of the RSR and the ISR, respectively. Both pathways depend critically on the MAPKKK, ZAK⍺ that binds preferentially to colliding ribosomes relative to monosomes. In addition to collisions induced by translation elongation inhibitors, such as ANS and EME, we showed that environmental perturbations—amino acid starvation and UV irradiation—also potently trigger ribosome collisions and thus the SAPK and GCN2 signaling pathways.
We suggest that basal levels of ribosome collisions are processed as mRNA-specific problems by dedicated QC pathways ( Yan and Zaher, 2019 60. Yan, L.L. ∙ Zaher, H.S. How do cells cope with RNA damage and its consequences? J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294 :15158-15171 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (92) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, when the number of colliding ribosomes exceeds the typically modest capacity of these QC components, the cell responds by activating more general stress responses that promote survival or trigger death. Collisions are measured on a cellular “gauge” that determines the measured response for the problem. In such a view, the ribosome through its inherent translation activity alerts the cell to the need for activation of broad cellular stress responses. The MAPKKK ZAK⍺ effectively functions as a reader of the gauge, the sentinel, monitoring the intensity and/or duration of ribosome collisions ( Figure 7 B). We propose that the initial cellular response to widespread ribosome collisions would be to block global translation initiation through GCN2 to reduce ribosome loading on mRNAs and hence ribosome collisions. GCN2-mediated eIF2⍺ phosphorylation triggers the ISR through which the expression of specific genes takes place to promote cellular survival ( Pakos-Zebrucka et al., 2016 43. Pakos-Zebrucka, K. ∙ Koryga, I. ∙ Mnich, K. ... The integrated stress response EMBO Rep. 2016; 17 :1374-1395 Crossref Scopus (1409) PubMed Google Scholar ). When the intensity and/or duration of ribosome collisions exceed the cellular capacity to resolve collisions, or to recover from stress through the ISR, ZAK⍺ activates the SAPK-mediated apoptosis pathway to mitigate damage and target the cell for death. For example, although the RSR induced by experimental elongation inhibitors such as ANS may not be resolved by activation of GCN2 and the ISR, more physiological conditions that trigger ribosome collisions, such as amino acid starvation or even UV irradiation, may be resolved by the ISR, thus preventing SAPK-mediated apoptosis.
Our finding that ribosome collisions trigger GCN2-mediated eIF2⍺ phosphorylation is broadly consistent with numerous previous observations. First, GCN2/1/20 associates with polysomes independent of amino acid starvation ( Marton et al., 1997 40. Marton, M.J. ∙ Vazquez de Aldana, C.R. ∙ Qiu, H. ... Evidence that GCN1 and GCN20, translational regulators of GCN4, function on elongating ribosomes in activation of eIF2alpha kinase GCN2 Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17 :4474-4489 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Ramirez et al., 1991 44. Ramirez, M. ∙ Wek, R.C. ∙ Hinnebusch, A.G. Ribosome association of GCN2 protein kinase, a translational activator of the GCN4 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11 :3027-3036 Crossref Scopus (137) PubMed Google Scholar ). GCN2 was recently proposed to be activated by stalled ribosomes in cells ( Ishimura et al., 2016 25. Ishimura, R. ∙ Nagy, G. ∙ Dotu, I. ... Activation of GCN2 kinase by ribosome stalling links translation elongation with translation initiation eLife. 2016; 5 :e14295 Crossref Scopus (119) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the ribosomal P-stalk alone was shown to activate GCN2 in a reconstituted system in vitro ( Harding et al., 2019 17. Harding, H.P. ∙ Ordonez, A. ∙ Allen, F. ... The ribosomal P-stalk couples amino acid starvation to GCN2 activation in mammalian cells eLife. 2019; 8 :e50149 Crossref Scopus (80) PubMed Google Scholar ; Inglis et al., 2019 20. Inglis, A.J. ∙ Masson, G.R. ∙ Shao, S. ... Activation of GCN2 by the ribosomal P-stalk Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2019; 116 :4946-4954 Crossref Scopus (106) PubMed Google Scholar ; Jiménez-Díaz et al., 2013 29. Jiménez-Díaz, A. ∙ Remacha, M. ∙ Ballesta, J.P.G. ... Phosphorylation of initiation factor eIF2 in response to stress conditions is mediated by acidic ribosomal P1/P2 proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae PLoS ONE. 2013; 8 :e84219 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ). We add a critical layer wherein ZAK⍺ facilitates activation of GCN2 potentially through interactions between GCN1, a GCN2 activator, and colliding ribosomes ( Figures 4 C and 4E). Although ZAK⍺ is critical for both SAPK and GCN2 activation, an important distinction is that the kinase activity of ZAK⍺ is only critical for SAPK activation ( Figure 2 A), and not for GCN2 activation ( Figure 4 D). Future structural analysis of ZAK⍺ on colliding ribosomes will further an understanding of how ZAK⍺ influences GCN2-mediated eIF2⍺ phosphorylation independent of its kinase activity.
Much previous work characterizing UV-induced cellular damage has focused on DNA lesions ( Ciccia and Elledge, 2010 5. Ciccia, A. ∙ Elledge, S.J. The DNA damage response: making it safe to play with knives Mol. Cell. 2010; 40 :179-204 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (3247) PubMed Google Scholar ) and cellular responses over relatively long time frames. We make the striking observation that UV irradiation induces ribosome collisions through mRNA damage, leading to ZAK⍺-dependent activation of both GCN2 and SAPK signaling on short timescales. Using ribosome profiling, we show that short RPFs that correspond to ribosomes waiting to decode (with an empty A site) are markedly enriched under UV irradiation ( Figure 6 B), suggesting that ribosomes are trapped during the decoding step of elongation. These results make sense in the context of the directionality of ribosome movement on mRNAs (5′ to 3′): the first encounter of a ribosome with damaged mRNA will occur in the A site during decoding. Our data further indicate that UV irradiation results in disproportionate ribosome stalling at codons with two adjacent pyrimidines ( Figure 6 C) and ribosome collisions accumulate behind these codons ( Figure 6 D). Finally, a direct mRNA transfection experiment establishes that mRNA damage from UV irradiation is sufficient to promote the ZAK-dependent responses that we characterized ( Figure 6 F). More generally, these data provide a clear example of how other physiological stress such as oxidative and alkylation stresses ( Yan and Zaher, 2019 60. Yan, L.L. ∙ Zaher, H.S. How do cells cope with RNA damage and its consequences? J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294 :15158-15171 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (92) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yan et al., 2019 61. Yan, L.L. ∙ Simms, C.L. ∙ McLoughlin, F. ... Oxidation and alkylation stresses activate ribosome-quality control Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :5611 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ) might be sensed through the action of the ribosome, triggering rapid cellular responses that dictate cell fate decisions.
During revision of this study, Vind et al. (2020) 55. Vind, A.C. ∙ Snieckute, G. ∙ Blasius, M. ... ZAKα Recognizes Stalled Ribosomes through Partially Redundant Sensor Domains Mol. Cell. 2020; 78 :700-713 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (72) PubMed Google Scholar reported that ZAK⍺ associates with stalled ribosomes to initiate the RSR and they defined key domains and phosphorylation sites critical to ribosome binding and activation. These authors argued, however, that the RSR is not activated by colliding ribosomes, but instead by slowed elongating single ribosomes. Importantly, their experiments may have been complicated by use of the reversible binding inhibitor cycloheximide ( Hussmann et al., 2015 19. Hussmann, J.A. ∙ Patchett, S. ∙ Johnson, A. ... Understanding Biases in Ribosome Profiling Experiments Reveals Signatures of Translation Dynamics in Yeast PLoS Genet. 2015; 11 :e1005732 Crossref Scopus (154) PubMed Google Scholar ) that is likely to promote collisions at all doses and by not titrating ANS to the point of fully blocking elongation (our experiments used more than 3 times the amount of ANS at the high end of the titration). Interestingly, their reported activation of the RSR by the early elongation inhibitor lactimidomycin may reflect collisions between stalled initiating ribosomes and scanning 40S subunits. Further studies will be needed to resolve these different observations.
Our results are strongly consistent with a model where ribosome collisions are the key activator of both mRNA-specific QC events and of the RSR. Our model is parsimonious and easily rationalizes how so many diverse stresses (ANS, EME, aa-starvation, and UV damage) would result in the same general outcomes of SAPK and GCN2 signaling activation. We anticipate that different cell types, with different inherent demands on protein synthesis, will exhibit different sensitivities to perturbations of translational homeostasis. Defining these differences will likely reveal interesting connections between ribosome biology and cell fate, with ZAK⍺ playing a central role.

Flp-In T-REx 293 and Flp-In T-REx HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (DMEM) in 10% FBS, 2 mM glutamine. In the text and figures, Flp-In T-REx 293 and Flp-In T-REx HeLa cells are labeled as HEK293 and HeLa, respectively. MCF10A cells were grown in DMEM/F12 Ham’s Mixture supplemented with 5% Equine Serum, 20 μg/L EGF, 0.5 g/L hydrocortisone, 100 μg/L cholera toxin, and 10 mg/L insulin and 2mM glutamine. K562 cells were grown in Rosswell Park Memorial Institute 1640 (RPMI) media (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% FBS, 1mM pyruvate and 2mM L -glutamine.
Flp-In T-REx HeLa cells are a gift from Andrew Holland (Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine) ( Gassmann et al., 2010 14. Gassmann, R. ∙ Holland, A.J. ∙ Varma, D. ... Removal of Spindly from microtubule-attached kinetochores controls spindle checkpoint silencing in human cells Genes Dev. 2010; 24 :957-971 Crossref Scopus (152) PubMed Google Scholar ). To generate HeLa cell line inducibly expressing ZAKα-FLAG WT or K45M variant, ZAKα-FLAG-pcDNA5 (WT or K45M variant) was co-transfected with pOG44 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, V600520) into Flp-In T-REx HeLa cells and selected in media supplemented with 100 mg/L hygromycin according to manufacturer’s instructions. Expression of ZAKα-FLAG (WT) was induced for 24 hr with the addition of doxycycline at 2 mg/L, except for Figure 2 F wherein ZAKα-FLAG (WT or K45M) was induced for 5-6 hr with the addition of doxycycline at 2 μg/L.
MCF10A reporter cell lines were generated by lentiviral infection. Lentivirus was generated with lipofectamine transfection of third-generation viral packaging plasmids and lentiviral reporter constructs into HEK293FT cells. Cells were incubated in viral supernatant with polybrene (10 μg/ml) (EMD Millipore) for 48 hours before selection. MCF10A cell lines were transduced with H2B-iRFP nuclear marker (no selection marker), ERK-KTR-mCerulean3 (hygromycin B), JNK-KTR-mRuby2 (blasticidin), and p38-KTR-mClover (no selection marker) ( Regot et al., 2014 45. Regot, S. ∙ Hughey, J.J. ∙ Bajar, B.T. ... High-sensitivity Measurements of Multiple Kinase Activities in Live Single Cells Cell. 2014; 157 :1724-1734 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (373) PubMed Google Scholar ) and selected with hygromycin B (100 μg/ml) (Invivogen) and blasticidin (3 μg/ml) (Invivogen) before clonal expansion. The ZAK-KO cell line was created by ligation of guide RNA targeting exon 1 (target sequence: ATGGATATCACAGGACAAGG) of the human ZAK gene into a CRISPR V2 neomycin-resistant vector (provided by A. Holland, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine) and transduced into MCF10A cells stably expressing H2B-iRFP, ERK-KTR-mCerulean3, JNK-KTR-mRuby2, and p38-KTR-mClover. Cells were selected for neomycin resistance (0.5 g/L) and clonally expanded. To complement the ZAK KO cell line, ZAKα, ZAKα-K45M, ZAKβ, ZAKα-LZ mutant, ZAKα-ΔSAM, ZAKα-RKK mutant, ZAKα-FLAG, ZAKα-FLAG (1-720), or ZAKα-FLAG (1-649) in pLenti PGK Puro DEST vector (w529-2) (Addgene) was transduced into ZAK KO cells and selected for puromycin resistance (2 μg/ml). Cells were validated for expression and activity using live-cell imaging and western blotting.
To generate GCN2 knockdown MCF10A cell lines, scramble shRNA, GCN2-shRNA1 (GAATGGTTGGCACTGCTCTCTATGTAAGC) or GCN2-shRNA2 (AGTCATCTCCTGGCTGTTGAACCACGATC) was cloned into pGFP-C-shLenti (OriGene), transduced, and selected under puromycin following manufacturer’s instructions.
To generate cell line cBZ056 for CRISPR screening, a K562 line containing a tandem tagBFP-tdTomato reporter (irrelevant to the current study) was lentivirally transduced with lentiCas9-Blast (addgene #52962) and after a 24-hour recovery, selected with 20 mg/L blasticidin for 4 days, at which point untransduced cells showed no viability. Cas9 integration was confirmed by western blotting and by sgRNA targeting of test genes.
Cells were grown to ∼70% confluency and then treated with indicated antibiotic for 15 min. Following treatment, cells were rinsed once with PBS and lysed in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-Cl [pH 8], 150 mM KCl, 15 mM MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 1mM DTT, phosphatase inhibitor cocktail [Cell Signaling, 5870], EDTA-free Protease inhibitor cocktail [Roche Diagnostics, 5056489001]). Lysates containing 200 μg of total RNA were run through 10%–50% sucrose gradients using Beckmann Coulter SW41 Ti rotor at 40,000 rpm for 4°C for 3 hr. For RNase-digested profiles, lysates containing 100 μg of total RNA were treated with RNase A (Thermo Fisher Scientific, EN0531) at 4 mg/L for 15 min at RT and quenched by adding 200 U of SUPERaseIn (Thermo Fisher Scientific, AM2694). Digested lysates were run through 10%–35% sucrose gradients (20 mM Tris-Cl [pH 8], 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 ) using Beckmann Coulter SW41 Ti rotors at 40,000 rpm for 4°C for 2 hr. For Figure 4 F, cells were rinsed once with PBS and treated with 0.5 mM DSP (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 22585) in PBS for 10 min at RT. After crosslinking, cells were lysed in HEPES lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES [pH 7.5], 150 mM KCl, 15 mM MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, phosphatase inhibitor cocktail, EDTA-free Protease inhibitor cocktail). Digested lysates were run through 10%–35% sucrose gradients (20 mM HEPES [pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 ). Gradients were fractionated using a Biocomp piston gradient fractionator. The absorbance at 254nm was recorded. Protein was TCA-precipitated from the fractions and methanol-precipitated to remove residual sucrose. Pellets were resuspended in Laemmli loading buffer containing DTT and boiled at 99°C for 5 min.
Culture medium was refreshed ∼2 hr before treatment. For antibiotic or cytokine treatments, cells were incubated with antibiotics and/or cytokine at indicated concentrations for 15 or 30 min before harvest. Anisomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, A9789) and emetine (Cayman Chemical, 21048) were dissolved in ethanol and H 2 O, respectively. TNFα (Sigma, PHP051A) was reconstituted in H 2 O. For phosphatase treatment, lysates were incubated with lambda phosphatase (NEB, P0753S) following the manufacturer’s instructions. For glutamine starvation, cells were pretreated with DMSO or 1.1 μM ISRIB (dissolved in DMSO) for 30 min, then washed twice with DMEM media without L -glutamine (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 11960-044), and cultured in the same media with DMSO or 1.1 μM ISRIB for 1 hr before harvest. For A 60 reporter experiments ( Figure 1 E), ∼400,000 HeLa cells were transfected with 10 μg of pcDNA5, A 0 , or A 60 reporters using Lipofectamine 3000 ∼24 hr prior to harvest. For inhibitor experiments, cells were pretreated with eIF2⍺ kinase inhibitors (GSK2606414 at 200 nM or A-92 at 1 μM) or p38 inhibitor (BIRB 796 at 5 μM) for 30 min following anisomycin treatment for 30 min. For UV irradiation, cells were irradiated in a Stratagene UV Stratalinker 2400 at 1,200 J/m 2 (UV-C) in culture media with the lid open. Following irradiation, cells were recovered at 37°C for indicated time. For EGFP mRNA transfection experiments, 5 μg of EGFP mRNA (TriLink Biotech, L-7601-100) was reconstituted in nuclease-free water and irradiated with UVC at 3,600 J/m 2 twice and transfected into ∼2x10 5 HeLa cells using TransIT-mRNA transfection kit (Mirus). Non-irradiated EGFP mRNA was transfected as an untreated control. Transfected cells were harvested 5 hr after transfection.
In general, cells were rinsed with PBS once and lysed in lysis buffer. Lysates were kept on ice during preparation and clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 5 min. After clarification, supernatants were boiled in Laemmli loading buffer containing DTT at 99°C for 5 min. Equal amount of proteins were resolved by 4%–12% Criterion XT Bis-Tris protein gels (Bio-Rad, 3450124) and transferred to PVDF membranes using a Trans-Blot Turbo transfer system (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk (Bio-Rad, 1706404XTU) in PBST for 1 hr at RT with gentle rocking. Blots were washed in PBST and then incubated with indicated primary antibodies overnight at 4°C with gentle rocking. Blots were washed with PBST, 3-4 times over 45-60 min at RT with gentle rocking, then incubated with secondary antibodies (if needed) diluted in PBST for 1 hr with gentle rocking. Membranes were washed again with PBST, 3-4 times over 45-60 min at RT, developed using SuperSignal West Pico Plus ECL substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 34580) and SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 34095), and imaged on a G:Box Chemi XRQ system. Shown are representative results from at least two independent experiments.
For Phos-tag gel immunoblotting, cells were lysed in lysis buffer, resolved by 7% SDS-PAGE containing 10.7 μM Phos-tag (Wako, AAL-107) and 21.3 μM MnCl 2 , and transferred to PVDF membranes following manufacturer’s instructions. Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in for 1 hr at RT with gentle rocking. Blots were washed in PBST and then incubated with indicated antibodies overnight at 4°C or for 1 hr at RT with gentle rocking. Blots were washed with PBST, 3-4 times over 45-60 min at RT with gentle rocking, then developed using SuperSignal West Pico Plus ECL substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 34580), and imaged on a G:Box Chemi XRQ system.
The following antibodies were used in this study.

Antibodies for ZAK⍺ (A301-993A, A301-994A) and RPS2 (A303-794A) were purchased from Bethyl Laboratories Inc. Phospho- eIF2⍺ (Ser51, ab32157) from Abcam. Antibodies for FLAG (A8592) and ZAKβ (HPA017205) were from Sigma-Aldrich. RPL4 antibody (11302-1-AP) was from Proteintech. GFP antibody (632381) was from Takara Bio. Mouse anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (sc-2357) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Goat anti-mouse IgG2a-HRP (115-035-206) was from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc.
HeLa cells were plated (10,000 cells per well) onto 96-well plates prior to treatment with anisomycin for 30 min. Cell lysis was measure using CellTox Green Cytotoxicity Assay kit (Promega, G8741) following manufacturer’s instructions. 9% Triton X-100 was used as a positive control for cell lysis.
To measure cell death, MCF10A cells were plated (27,000 cells per well) onto glass-bottom 96 well imaging plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coated with 10 mg/L fibronectin (Sigma-Aldrich) and left to adhere and expand for 24 hr. The next day, cells were washed once with PBS and switched to imaging media (phenol-red free DMEM F12 (Thermo Fisher), 5% Horse Serum, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (GIBCO). 24 hours later, the cells were incubated with 10 μM of CellEvent Caspase-3/7 Green Detection Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, C10423) and imaged on a Nikon Eclipse Ti-E inverted fluorescence microscope with an Andor Neo 5.5 or Hamamatsu sCMOS camera. Light-emitting diode (LED) excitation light source (SPECTRA X) was used at 500/20 nm (green fluorescent dye) and 640/30 nm (iRFP670). Cells were imaged for 24 hours after the addition of anisomycin or media and changes in green fluorescence were measured.
HeLa cells expressing ZAK⍺-FLAG from eight 15-cm plates (∼2.5 × 10 6 /plate) were transfected with A 60 -reporter (10 μg/plate) two days prior to harvest using Lipofectamin 3000 according to manufacturer’s instructions. ZAK⍺-FLAG was induced by the addition of doxycycline at 2 mg/L 24 hr prior to cell lysis. Cells were washed with PBS and collected in 700 μL of footprint lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-Cl [pH 8], 150 mM KCl, 15 mM MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 1mM DTT, 0.1 g/L cycloheximide with vigorous scrapping. Lysates were digested with TURBO DNase (2 U per mL) for 15 min on ice and clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 5 min. Lysates containing 150 μg of total RNA were digested with 187.5 U of MNase at 25°C for 1 hr, quenched by adding EGTA (pH 8) to 1.16 mM, and run through 10%–30% sucrose gradients (20 mM Tris-Cl [pH 8], 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 ) using Beckmann Coulter SW41 Ti rotors at 40,000 rpm for 4°C for 2.5 hr. Gradients were fractionated using a Biocomp piston gradient fractionator. Fractions were pooled and incubated without (mock) or with ZAK⍺ antibody (Bethyl Laboratories Inc., A301-994A) at 62.5 mg/L and 500 U SUPERaseIn overnight at 4°C with gentle nutation. 200 μL of sheep anti-rabbit IgG Dynabeads M-280 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 11203D) were added to each condition and incubated at 4°C for 6 hr. Magnetic beads were washed 3 times with footprint lysis buffer without DTT. Immunoprecipitates were eluted in 250 μL of elution buffer (100 mM glycine [pH 2.8], 50U SUPERaseIn). RNA was extracted by hot acid phenol and size-selected from 15% denaturing PAGE gels, cutting between 24-90 nt for monosome and disome footprints. Library construction was as carried out as described previously ( Wu et al., 2019 59. Wu, C.C.-C. ∙ Zinshteyn, B. ∙ Wehner, K.A. ... High-Resolution Ribosome Profiling Defines Discrete Ribosome Elongation States and Translational Regulation during Cellular Stress Mol. Cell. 2019; 73 :959-970 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (151) PubMed Google Scholar ). Libraries were sequenced on a HiSeq2500 machine at facilities at the Johns Hopkins Institute of Genetic Medicine.
Following UV irradiation, HeLa cells were recovered at 37°C for 15 min (replicate 1) or 30 min (replicate 2). Cells were washed with PBS once and collected in 700 μL of footprint lysis buffer (see above) with vigorous scrapping. Lysates were digested with TURBO DNase (2 units per mL) for 15 min on ice and clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 10 min. Lysates containing 10 μg of total RNA were digested with 750 units of RNase I (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 2295) at 25°C for 1 hr with gentle shaking and quenched by adding 200 units of SUPERaseIn. Nuclease-treated lysates were layered on a sucrose cushion [20 mM Tris-Cl (pH8), 150mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM DTT, 1 M sucrose]. Ribosomes were pelleted by centrifugation in a TLA100.3 rotor at 100,000 rpm for 1 hr at 4°C and RNA was extracted by miRNeasy mini kit (QIAGEN). Library construction was as carried out as described previously ( Wu et al., 2019 59. Wu, C.C.-C. ∙ Zinshteyn, B. ∙ Wehner, K.A. ... High-Resolution Ribosome Profiling Defines Discrete Ribosome Elongation States and Translational Regulation during Cellular Stress Mol. Cell. 2019; 73 :959-970 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (151) PubMed Google Scholar ), except using TGIRT (InGex) to perform the reverse transcription reactions.
Lentivirus was produced from the Brunello Human CRISPR knockout pooled library (Addgene, 73179) ( Sanson et al., 2018 47. Sanson, K.R. ∙ Hanna, R.E. ∙ Hegde, M. ... Optimized libraries for CRISPR-Cas9 genetic screens with multiple modalities Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :5416 Crossref Scopus (385) PubMed Google Scholar ) by cotransfecting seven 15cm dishes of 70% confluent HEK293FT cells (in 20ml DMEM+10% FBS) with a cocktail of 28ml Opti-MEM media, 840 μL lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, L3000015), 64 μg of the library, 119.4 μg psPAX2 (Addgene, 12259), 51.6 μg pMD2.G (Addgene, 12259) and 644 μL P3000 ( Joung et al., 2017 30. Joung, J. ∙ Konermann, S. ∙ Gootenberg, J.S. ... Genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 knockout and transcriptional activation screening Nat. Protoc. 2017; 12 :828-863 Crossref Scopus (669) PubMed Google Scholar ). Virus-containing media was collected, replaced, and passed through a 0.45 micron filter at 48, 72, and 96 hours. ∼420ml of pooled media was concentrated to ∼4ml with 100K centricon plus-70 filters and frozen. The library was transduced by spinfection into 200 million cBZ056 cells (see Generation of Cell Lines) at a 30% infection rate. 2 days after transduction, the cells were selected with 0.5 g/L puromycin for 2 days, and aliquots of 10 8 cells were frozen. To conduct growth-based screens, 120 million cells were seeded in a T225 flask for each condition prior to selection. All screens were performed in duplicate. The cells were treated with ethanol (vehicle) or anisomycin at 0.1 or 1 mg/L. Ethanol-treated cells were maintained in flasks by daily dilution to ∼0.5x 10 6 cells per mL. After 12 days of selection, cells were harvested by centrifugation. Genomic DNA was extracted from ∼150 million cells using NucleoSpin columns (MACHEREY-NAGEL, 740950) according to manufacturer’s instructions, except that RNase A was added after proteinase K inactivation, and incubated for 2 hour at RT. Guide RNA sequences were amplified from genomic DNA in 30x50 μL PCR reactions containing 25μL NEBNext Ultra II Q5 Master mix (NEB M0544), 5 μg genomic DNA, 1.25 μL F primer cocktail (2.5 μM each of oBZ475-oBZ478) and 1.25 μL of one barcoded reverse primer (oBZ479-490) per library. Primers are listed in Table S3. Thermal cycling was performed as follows: 3 minutes at 98°C, 20 cycles of (10 s at 98°C, 10 s at 68°C, 25 s at 72°C), 2 minutes at 72°C. PCR products were pooled, and 300 μl of pooled PCR product was cleaned up with SPRIselect beads (Beckmann Coulter, B23317) using 0.55x and 0.95x cuts to isolate the expected product size. Purified libraries were quantified with an Agilent Bioanalyzer using a high sensitivity DNA chip (Agilent 5067-4627), pooled at equimolar ratios, and sequenced with 66nt single-end reads on a HiSeq2500 sequencer (Illumina).
Statistical details can be found in figure legends.
The intensity of the protein bands/smears was quantified using Fiji ( Schindelin et al., 2012 48. Schindelin, J. ∙ Arganda-Carreras, I. ∙ Frise, E. ... Fiji: an open-source platform for biological-image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :676-682 Crossref Scopus (38239) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Hg19 reference genome assembly from UCSC was used for alignment. A transcriptome file was generated to include canonical transcript of known genes from UCSC table browser. 3′ adaptor (NNNNNNCACTCGGGCACCAAGGA) was trimmed with skewer ( Jiang et al., 2014 28. Jiang, H. ∙ Lei, R. ∙ Ding, S.W. ... Skewer: a fast and accurate adapter trimmer for next-generation sequencing paired-end reads BMC Bioinformatics. 2014; 15 :182 Crossref Scopus (904) PubMed Google Scholar ), and 4 random nucleotides included in the RT primer oBZ408 ( RNNN AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGTAGATCTCGGTGGTCGC/iSP18/TTCAGACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATCTGTCCTTGGTGCCCGAGTG) were removed from the 5′ end of reads. Trimmed reads longer than 24 nt (for ZAK⍺ selective ribosome profiling) or 15 nt (for regular ribosome profiling experiments) were aligned to human ribosomal and non-coding RNA sequence using STAR ( Dobin et al., 2013 10. Dobin, A. ∙ Davis, C.A. ∙ Schlesinger, F. ... STAR: ultrafast universal RNA-seq aligner Bioinformatics. 2013; 29 :15-21 Crossref Scopus (25621) PubMed Google Scholar ) with the option ‘–outFilterMismatchNoverLmax 0.3′. Unmapped reads were then mapped to human genome with ‘–outFilterIntronMotifs RemoveNoncanonicalUnannotated–outFilterMultimapNmax 1–outFilterMismatchNoverLmax 0.1’. For monosome footprints, offsets (20:[16], 21:[17], 22:[17], 23:[17]) were used to infer the A site of short RPFs whereas offsets (30:[16], 31:[16], 32:[17], 33:[17]) were used to infer the A site of long RPFs. Short RPFs were used to calculate the codon-specific ribosome occupancies ( Figures 6 C and S7 C) while combined short and long RPFs were used for the meta-codon analysis ( Figure 6 D). For disome footprints ( Figures 3 F and S3 C–S3F), offsets (61:[44], 62:[44], 63:[44], 64:[44], 65:[44], 66:[44], 67:[44], 68:[44], 69:[44], 70:[44], 71:[43], 72:[43], 73:[43], 74:[43], 75:[43], 76:[43], 77:[43], 78:[43], 79:[43], 80:[43]) were used to infer the A site of the lead ribosome. All other analyses were performed using software custom written in Python 2.7 and R 3.3.1.
Sequencing reads were aligned to the Brunello library sequences and quantified using custom-written Python script. Effect size and false discovery rates were calculated by MAGeCK ( Li et al., 2014 38. Li, W. ∙ Xu, H. ∙ Xiao, T. ... MAGeCK enables robust identification of essential genes from genome-scale CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screens Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :554 Crossref Scopus (1187) PubMed Google Scholar ) using ‘–adjust-method fdr’ and available in Tables S1 and S2 .
