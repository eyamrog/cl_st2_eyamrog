Title: Insular cortex neurons encode and retrieve specific immune responses


Abstract: Summary

Increasing evidence indicates that the brain regulates peripheral immunity, yet whether and how the brain represents the state of the immune system remains unclear. Here, we show that the brain’s insular cortex (InsCtx) stores immune-related information. Using activity-dependent cell labeling in mice ( Fos TRAP ) , we captured neuronal ensembles in the InsCtx that were active under two different inflammatory conditions (dextran sulfate sodium [DSS]-induced colitis and zymosan-induced peritonitis). Chemogenetic reactivation of these neuronal ensembles was sufficient to broadly retrieve the inflammatory state under which these neurons were captured. Thus, we show that the brain can store and retrieve specific immune responses, extending the classical concept of immunological memory to neuronal representations of inflammatory information.

Section: Introduction

Accumulating data indicate that the brain can affect immunity, as evidenced, for example, by the effects of stress ( Chovatiya and Medzhitov, 2014 11. Chovatiya, R. ∙ Medzhitov, R.

However, our understanding of this neuroimmune interaction is still limited. Importantly, we do not know how the brain evaluates and represents the state of the immune system.
As a central regulator, it is likely that the brain receives feedback from any system it controls and, by extension, forms representations of the immune system. This concept is supported by several lines of evidence. First, anatomically, the brain receives immune-related information via sensory inputs from peripheral immune organs, such as the spleen and lymph nodes ( Dantzer, 2018 16. Dantzer, R.

Neural regulation of immunity: molecular mechanisms and clinical translation Nat. Neurosci. 2017; 20 :156-166 Crossref Scopus (341) PubMed Google Scholar ). Second, the brain responds to peripheral immune challenges. For example, neuroimaging studies identified increased activation of specific brain regions (e.g., the amygdala, hypothalamus, brainstem, thalamus, and insular cortex [InsCtx]) during peripheral inflammation ( Harrison et al., 2009 32. Harrison, N.A. ∙ Brydon, L. ∙ Walker, C. ... Neural origins of human sickness in interoceptive responses to inflammation Biol. Psychiatry. 2009; 66 :415-422 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (276) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sergeeva et al., 2015 71. Sergeeva, M. ∙ Rech, J. ∙ Schett, G. ... Response to peripheral immune stimulation within the brain: magnetic resonance imaging perspective of treatment success Arthritis Res. Ther. 2015; 17 :268 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ). Finally, the immune system has been shown to respond to immune conditioning by associating a specific immune response (e.g., immune suppression) with an external cue (e.g., saccharin water), such that presentation of the cue alone can elicit the immune response ( Ader and Cohen, 1975 1. Ader, R. ∙ Cohen, N. Behaviorally conditioned immunosuppression Psychosom. Med. 1975; 37 :333-340 Crossref Scopus (686) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hadamitzky et al., 2020 29. Hadamitzky, M. ∙ Lückemann, L. ∙ Pacheco-López, G. ... Pavlovian conditioning of immunological and neuroendocrine functions Physiol. Rev. 2020; 100 :357-405 Crossref Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar ). This suggests that the brain encodes immune-related information ( Cohen et al., 1994 12. Cohen, N. ∙ Moynihan, J.A. ∙ Ader, R. Pavlovian conditioning of the immune system Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. 1994; 105 :101-106 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, lesion studies identified specific brain regions required for immune conditioning, notably, the InsCtx ( Ramírez-Amaya et al., 1996 63. Ramírez-Amaya, V. ∙ Alvarez-Borda, B. ∙ Ormsby, C.E. ... Insular cortex lesions impair the acquisition of conditioned immunosuppression Brain Behav. Immun. 1996; 10 :103-114 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar , 1998 64. Ramírez-Amaya, V. ∙ Alvarez-Borda, B. ∙ Bermúdez-Rattoni, F. Differential effects of NMDA-induced lesions into the insular cortex and amygdala on the acquisition and evocation of conditioned immunosuppression Brain Behav. Immun. 1998; 12 :149-160 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the existence of such immune representations in the brain was never directly demonstrated.
The current study was designed to test the existence of immune-related information in the brain and determine its relevance to immune regulation. We hypothesized that the InsCtx, specifically the posterior InsCtx, is especially suited to contain such a representation of the immune system. This region is considered the primary cortical site of interoception (i.e., the sensing of the body’s physiological state; Craig, 2003 14. Craig, A.D. Interoception: the sense of the physiological condition of the body Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2003; 13 :500-505 Crossref Scopus (1904) PubMed Google Scholar ; Gogolla, 2017 27. Gogolla, N. The insular cortex Curr. Biol. 2017; 27 :R580-R586 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (441) PubMed Google Scholar ) and integrates information regarding bodily sensations, such as pain, hunger, and visceral signals ( Craig, 2002 13. Craig, A.D. How do you feel? Interoception: the sense of the physiological condition of the body Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3 :655-666 Crossref Scopus (4346) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although immune-related information is not a conventional aspect of interoception, it could provide an important indication of the organism’s physiological status ( Kipnis, 2018 42. Kipnis, J. Immune system: The “seventh sense” J. Exp. Med. 2018; 215 :397-398 Crossref Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ) and thus may also be processed in the posterior InsCtx. Moreover, the InsCtx is well positioned to gather immune-related information, as it receives input from peripheral neurons that respond to immune signals ( Goehler et al., 2000 26. Goehler, L.E. ∙ Gaykema, R.P.A. ∙ Hansen, M.K. ... Vagal immune-to-brain communication: a visceral chemosensory pathway Auton.

Neural concomitants of immunity—Focus on the vagus nerve Neuroimage. 2009; 47 :908-910 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ). Accordingly, studies have shown that immune challenges impact insular activity ( Critchley and Harrison, 2013 15. Critchley, H.D. ∙ Harrison, N.A.

Sci. 2011; 278 :1864-1872 Crossref Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ). Finally, as previously mentioned, lesion studies have shown that the InsCtx is essential for immune conditioning ( Pacheco-López et al., 2005 56. Pacheco-López, G. ∙ Niemi, M.B. ∙ Kou, W. ... Neural substrates for behaviorally conditioned immunosuppression in the rat J. Neurosci. 2005; 25 :2330-2337 Crossref Scopus (88) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ramírez-Amaya and Bermúdez-Rattoni, 1999 62.

Immun. 1999; 13 :46-60 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ), further supporting the hypothesis that this brain region can form immune-related representations.

Section: Results

To capture neurons that were active during a peripheral immune challenge, we used transgenic targeted-recombination-in-active-populations (TRAP) mice ( DeNardo et al., 2019 17. DeNardo, L.A. ∙ Liu, C.D. ∙ Allen, W.E. ... Temporal evolution of cortical ensembles promoting remote memory retrieval Nat.

These mice express iCreER T2 under the control of an activity-dependent c-Fos promoter ( Fos TRAP mice), which serves as an indicator of neuronal activity. In the presence of tamoxifen (TM), active neurons drive Cre-dependent recombination to induce the expression of an effector gene (e.g., fluorescent reporter). For the immune challenge, we chose a model of colon inflammation (colitis). Emerging experimental and epidemiological data established the significance of the gut-brain axis in gastrointestinal (GI) inflammatory conditions ( Fung et al., 2017 23.

The InsCtx receives information through the brainstem and thalamus from this highly innervated and immunologically active visceral organ ( Han et al., 2018 30.

Gut feelings: the emerging biology of gut-brain communication Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2011; 12 :453-466 Crossref Scopus (1191) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, we used a model of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis, to capture its potential representation in the InsCtx.
We crossed the TRAP mice with a Cre-dependent tdTomato reporter line, Ai14D ( Madisen et al., 2010 48. Madisen, L. ∙ Zwingman, T.A. ∙ Sunkin, S.M. ... A robust and high-throughput Cre reporting and characterization system for the whole mouse brain Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13 :133-140 Crossref Scopus (4610) PubMed Google Scholar ), to visualize the active cells. Mice were injected with TM (inducing Cre recombination and as a result, tdTomato expression) 48h after initiation of the DSS treatment (DSS + group). As controls, we used another group of TRAP-tdTomato mice that were injected with TM at the same time but did not receive DSS (DSS − group; Figure 1 B). This group allowed us to compare between inflammation-related activity in the brain, and brain activity during healthy homeostasis. Automated survey of whole brains revealed increased tdTomato expression (indicative of neuronal activity) in several brain areas ( Table S1 ), including the thalamus (receives sensory and visceral information), the paraventricular hypothalamic (PVH) nuclei (involved in physiological homeostasis and stress), the central amygdala (CeA; fear and memory formation), the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), the supplementary somatosensory cortex (S2; parts of the pain matrix), and the InsCtx (p < 0.0001; Figures 1 C and 1D). Thus, consistent with previous studies ( Belevych et al., 2010 4. Belevych, N. ∙ Buchanan, K. ∙ Chen, Q. ...

Neurosci. 2000; 20 :6578-6586 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), the brain, including the InsCtx, responds to peripheral immune challenge.
Based on this analysis and our prediction of the InsCtx functioning as an interoceptive site that receives immune-related information, we chose to focus on this area. Moreover, since the InsCtx exhibits some functional lateralization, we focused on the right InsCtx, which is more dominantly associated with sympathetic afferent innervation and visceral information processing ( Montalbano and Shane Tubbs, 2018 53. Montalbano, M.J. ∙ Shane Tubbs, R. Lateralization of the Insular Cortex Island of Reil (Insula) in the Human Brain. Springer International Publishing, Cham, 2018 129-132 Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar ). To target the TRAPing to this brain region and limit the labeling to neuronal populations, we used a viral vector instead of the TRAP-tdTomato reporter mice. The viral vector encoded the mCherry fluorescent reporter, expressed in a Cre-dependent manner under a neuronal-specific promoter, synapsin, and was stereotactically injected to the right posterior InsCtx of TRAP mice. To capture active neurons during colitis, we injected the mice with TM 48 h after initiation of the DSS treatment ( Figure 1 E). Most of the labeled cells ( Figure 1 F) were neurons rather than astrocytes or microglia ( Figure 1 G). More specifically, as determined by in situ hybridization, 71% of the TRAPed cells were glutamatergic, and 20% were GABAergic ( Figure 1 H). Thus, DSS-induced colitis is associated with increased activation of neurons in the InsCtx. However, such correlative findings are not sufficient to demonstrate that these neurons indeed encode immunologically relevant information.
To directly address this question, we reactivated the TRAPed neurons and evaluated their effects on the immune response. For the neuronal reactivation, we co-expressed a stimulatory DREADD (designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs; Gq) in the captured neurons. DREADDs are mutated muscarinic G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) activated by a synthetic ligand, clozapine N -oxide (CNO). Thus, CNO application enables the reactivation of the captured neurons at will. The control group was injected with a virus encoding the mCherry fluorescent reporter but lacking the DREADD-coding sequence (sham; Figure 2 A). This sham group allowed us to control for the surgical procedure, viral vector expression, amount of DSS water consumed ( Figure S1 A), and application of CNO. As in the previous experiment, we injected TM 48 h following initiation of the DSS treatment to capture the active InsCtx neurons and enable their expression of both Gq-DREADDs and a fluorescent reporter. After 4 weeks of recovery, we reactivated the captured InsCtx neuronal ensembles (by CNO injection; validated by c-Fos staining; Figures 2 B, 2C, and S1 B–S1D) and evaluated their effects on the peripheral immune response ( Figure S1 ). We also determined the tissue histopathology and permeability state ( Figures S1 E and S1F), weight loss ( Figure S1 G), histology severity score ( Figures 2 D and S1 H), and inflammation ( Figures 2 E–2P and S1 I–S1V). Even in the absence of an additional immune challenge, neuronal reactivation resulted in heightened immune activity in the colon of the Gq mice, in agreement with the changes evident during the initial or a repeated DSS treatment ( Figures 2 E–2P and S2 ). There was a significant increase in the percentage of leukocytes present in the mucosal layer of the colon, including the intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) and leukocytes within the lamina propria (LP; Figures 2 E and S1 M). Activated γδ T cells increased in the IEL and decreased in the LP in the Gq group compared to the sham-treated mice ( Figures 2 F, 2G, and S1 N), a characteristic trend that was previously demonstrated for γδ T cells during intestinal infection ( Hoytema van Konijnenburg et al., 2017 34. Hoytema van Konijnenburg, D.P. ∙ Reis, B.S. ∙ Pedicord, V.A. ... Intestinal Epithelial and Intraepithelial T Cell Crosstalk Mediates a Dynamic Response to Infection Cell. 2017; 171 :783-794.e13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (174) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, we found higher proportions of activated CD4 + T cells ( Figures 2 H, 2I, S1 O, and S1P) and an increase in the activation of CD8 + T cells ( Figures 2 J, 2K, and S1 Q–S1S). Similarly, we observed an increase in the percentage of a specific dendritic cell (DC) subset (CD103 − CD11b + ) in the LP, known to induce specific T cell activation in the gut ( Annacker et al., 2005 2. Annacker, O. ∙ Coombes, J.L. ∙ Malmstrom, V. ... Essential role for CD103 in the T cell-mediated regulation of experimental colitis J. Exp. Med. 2005; 202 :1051-1061 Crossref Scopus (417) PubMed Google Scholar ; Liang et al., 2016 45. Liang, J. ∙ Huang, H.I. ∙ Benzatti, F.P. ... Inflammatory Th1 and Th17 in the Intestine Are Each Driven by Functionally Specialized Dendritic Cells with Distinct Requirements for MyD88 Cell Rep. 2016; 17 :1330-1343 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures 2 L and S1 T). Intracellular analysis revealed an increase in the percentage of interleukin-6 (IL-6)-expressing IEL CD4 T cells ( Figures 2 M, 2N, and S1 U) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α)-expressing monocytes (in the LP ; Figures 2 O and S1 V). These changes were also supported by all-tissue colon analysis indicating elevated TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-17 levels in the Gq group, with no significant change in the levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 ( Figure S1 W). The increase in leukocyte abundance was further supported by the immunofluorescence (IF) analysis of the colon ( Figure 2 P). Moreover, these brain-induced effects were limited to the GI tract, as we did not detect any significant changes in immune cell populations in the peripheral blood or the mesenteric lymph nodes (mLNs) ( Figure S1 X). Nevertheless, some of the inflammatory effects induced by the neuronal reactivation were different (in magnitude or direction) from the response directly induced by the initial DSS administration, such as the changes observed in γδ T cells and the total percentage of leukocytes in the LP ( Figures 2 F and 2E, respectively). Other effects, such as an increase in mucosal granulocytes during DSS-induced colitis, were not recapitulated by InsCtx reactivation ( Figure S1 Y). Altogether, these observations suggest that the brain can reactivate previously acquired immune-related information. Nevertheless, the differences between these responses (original and reactivated) highlight the potential limitations of our experimental paradigm, the complexity of such brain representations, and interactions with the peripheral tissue.
Since the controls we used thus far expressed only the fluorescent reporter, CNO application did not induce any neuronal activation in this group, potentially disputing the hypothesis that the observed effects are specific to TRAPed neurons. To test whether specific neuronal ensembles can differentially affect the colon immune response, we induced neuronal reactivation in all experimental groups, but varied the immunological context at which these neurons were TRAPed. Thus, mice expressing Gq were injected with TM before, during, or after DSS (Gq before, Gq during, and Gq after, respectively). All three groups were subjected to the same experimental procedures (i.e., the same viral vector and DSS treatment) and, due to ongoing baseline activity, were all expected to TRAP neurons in the InsCtx. Upon recovery, we reactivated the captured neuronal populations, and evaluated the effects on the immune state in their colons ( Figures 3 A and S3 ).
Although all groups expressed the Gq-DREADD, only the Gq-during group showed a significant increase in the inflammatory response in the colon ( Figures 3 B–3G and S3 C–S3F). The percentage of activated γδ T cells in the IEL population increased, while activated γδ T cells in the LP decreased ( Figures 3 C and S3 D). Percentage of activated CD4 + T cells (CD69 + CD4 + ) increased in IELs and LP ( Figures 3 D and S3 E), as well as their expression of the activation marker CD69 ( Figures 3 E and S3 F). As in the previous experiment ( Figure 2 ), the increase in LP leukocyte abundance was further supported by the IF analysis of the colon ( Figure 3 F and 3G). Hence, only InsCtx neurons captured during the original inflammation could induce colon inflammation.
However, the difference in the immunological outcome among the three experimental groups could be due to the number of activated neurons ( Figures 3 H and 3I) rather than the specific information they encode. Therefore, we expressed DREADDs in a Cre-independent manner, targeting approximately twice (2.06-fold ± 0.42-fold; p = 0.0045) the number of neurons in the same region in the InsCtx ( Figures 4 A–4E). This robust yet general activation did not induce an inflammatory response in the colon ( Figures 4 F–4K). Moreover, even when we repeated the nonspecific activation paradigm in mice that were previously exposed to DSS ( Figure 4 L), we could not detect any significant immune effect in the colon following the nonspecific InsCtx activation ( Figures 4 M–4R and S4 ). These observations further support the specificity of the information encoded by the brain and their causal effect on inducing peripheral inflammation.
To examine the nature of the immune information encoded by neuronal ensembles in the InsCtx, we added a different immune challenge, zymosan-induced peritonitis (ZIP). This well-defined inflammatory process affects another visceral area (the peritoneum), and it is immunologically distinct from the DSS-induced colitis. As in the previous experiments, Fos TRAP mice were injected with the Gq-DREADD or a sham viral vector to their InsCtx. One Gq group received TM before ZIP (Gq before), while a second Gq group (Gq during) and the sham viral vector-expressing group (sham) were injected with TM during ZIP ( Figure 5 A). In contrast to the DSS-induced colitis, there was no difference in the number of the TRAPed neurons captured during ZIP compared to their controls ( Figures 5 B and 5C), possibly due to the more acute nature of this model. Following recovery, all groups were injected with CNO to induce neuronal reactivation.
As in the DSS paradigm, the observed immunological changes in the ZIP model were reminiscent of the inflammatory response directly induced by zymosan administration ( Figures 5 D–5O and S5 ). For example, the percentage of peritoneal monocytes, granulocytes, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4 + ), and interferon-γ (IFN-γ + ) leukocytes ( Figures 5 D–5H) was increased in the Gq-during group. Similarly, expression of TLR2, which recognizes zymosan, was significantly increased on most peritoneal leukocytes in the Gq-during group ( Figures 5 I–5M and S5 E). Moreover, we found a significant increase in the levels of the cytokines TNF-α and IL-17 in the peritoneal lavage fluid (PLF) of the Gq-during group, while no significant changes were observed in IL-6 and IL-10 concentrations ( Figure S5 F). As in the DSS model, some of the immune effects evident during the original inflammation were not recapitulated in the reactivation paradigm ( Figures 5 N–5O). Importantly, the effects induced by neurons TRAPed during ZIP were distinct from the effects detected in the DSS model ( Figures 2 E–2O), although in both models, we could not fully allocate the source of all elevated cytokine levels to a specific immune cell subset ( Figures S5 G–S5L), suggesting that other tissue cells may contribute to this phenomenon.
Importantly, the information encoded in the InsCtx also included anatomical information, since reactivation of neuronal ensembles captured during ZIP were specific to the peritoneum. We did not observe any changes in immune parameters in the colon ( Figures S5 M–S5R) or robust effects in the mLNs or blood ( Figures 5 D–5O). These results demonstrate that even without an additional immune challenge, the immune-related information encoded in the InsCtx is sufficient to induce anatomically defined, specific peripheral immune reactions.
As in the DSS-induced colitis experiment, general activation of the InsCtx, using TRAP-independent Gq expression ( Figure S6 A), did not induce the effects observed in the peritoneum ( Figures S6 C–S6J). However, in this model, when we added previous peritoneal exposure to zymosan ( Figure S6 B ) , the nonspecific activation of the InsCtx recapitulated some of the immune effects that were detected in the original peritonitis, mainly the increase in TLR2 levels ( Figures S6 G–S6I). One possibility is that the nonspecific activation also reactivated some of the neurons that were also active during the original inflammation.
In the “classical memory”, the neurons integrated into ensembles can vary over days and even hours ( Hyman et al., 2012 36. Hyman, J.M. ∙ Ma, L. ∙ Balaguer-Ballester, E. ...

Therefore, we examined whether the same InsCtx neurons are activated during two similar inflammatory experiences. We evaluated c-Fos expression by TRAPing neurons in the initial zymosan exposure and compared them to the c-Fos-expressing neurons identified by IF, following a second zymosan exposure 14 days later ( Figure S6 K). Although a comparison between TRAPed neurons and neurons labeled by IF has several limitations, our findings support the concept that unique neuronal ensembles encode each immune experience, as there was only limited overlap between the neurons labeled during the two separate zymosan exposures ( Figure S6 L).
Stress and pain are known to play a critical role in immune regulation (( Dhabhar, 2014 18. Dhabhar, F.S. Effects of stress on immune function: the good, the bad, and the beautiful Immunol. Res. 2014; 58 :193-210 Crossref Scopus (783) PubMed Google Scholar ); Pinho-Ribeiro et al., 2017 59. Pinho-Ribeiro, F.A. ∙ Verri, Jr., W.A. ∙ Chiu, I.M. Nociceptor Sensory Neuron-Immune Interactions in Pain and Inflammation Trends Immunol. 2017; 38 :5-19 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (636) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, we did not identify an increase in corticosterone or noradrenaline levels following our neuronal manipulation ( Figures S7 A and S7B). To dissect the potential effect of pain on the immune information encoded and induced by the InsCtx, we used an analgesic drug, acetaminophen, during TRAPing. To ensure that timing of the neuronal TRAPing is aligned with the maximal effect of the analgesia, we used 4-hydroxy TM (4-OHT), which has a shorter time window of activity compared to TM ( DeNardo et al., 2019 17. DeNardo, L.A. ∙ Liu, C.D. ∙ Allen, W.E. ... Temporal evolution of cortical ensembles promoting remote memory retrieval Nat. Neurosci. 2019; 22 :460-469 Crossref Scopus (253) PubMed Google Scholar ; Guenthner et al., 2013 28. Guenthner, C.J. ∙ Miyamichi, K. ∙ Yang, H.H. ... Permanent genetic access to transiently active neurons via TRAP: targeted recombination in active populations Neuron. 2013; 78 :773-784 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (422) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures S7 E–S7G). In spite of the attenuated pain ( Figures S7 C and S7D), we found that some immune effects were still evident in this group ( Figure S7 H), indicating that at least part of the immune information that is encoded in the InsCtx is not mediated by pain. Yet, other effects that were abolished in the presence of analgesic suggest that pain can also alter the immune experience encoded by the brain.
To identify the potential anatomical pathways that enable such communication between the InsCtx and these visceral sites, we used polysynaptic retrograde tracing. First, we injected a pseudorabies virus (PRV) carrying a GFP fluorescent reporter into the colons of wild-type mice ( Figures 6 A and 6B). After 7 days, a fluorescent signal of the PRV was seen in the InsCtx, indicating that neurons in the InsCtx can potentially deliver information to the colon ( Figure 6 C). However, these data do not unequivocally prove that the specific neurons included in the TRAPed ensembles can also deliver signals to the same region. Thus, we used TRAP mice and captured the neurons during colitis ( Figure 6 D). Then, upon recovery, we injected these mice with PRV to the colon. Indeed, we could see that some of the TRAPed neurons also expressed GFP encoded by the PRV ( Figure 6 E), demonstrating that neurons included in the TRAPed ensembles, which can induce local inflammation, have a direct path of communication with the colon.
In the peritonitis model, we injected the PRV in the peritoneum, but to the InsCtx, we injected a virus that has both retrograde and anterograde monosynaptic transport (AAV1) for capturing the active neurons ( Figures 6 F and 6G). This allowed us to identify that the PRV and AAV1 overlapped in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV), the vagal control center, and the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) ( Figure 6 H), which coordinates the sympathetic nervous system. These findings suggest that neurons TRAPed during peripheral inflammation can directly deliver messages to the peripheral sites and that these effects are mediated via the autonomic nervous system.
Since InsCtx activity can initiate and induce a peripheral immune response, it could potentially trigger or exacerbate inflammatory conditions. Indeed, changes in InsCtx activity are evident in inflammatory diseases, especially common in gut-related disorders ( Chen et al., 2011 10. Chen, J.Y.W. ∙ Blankstein, U. ∙ Diamant, N.E. ... White matter abnormalities in irritable bowel syndrome and relation to individual factors Brain Res. 2011; 1392 :121-131 Crossref Scopus (97) PubMed Google Scholar ; Turkiewicz et al., 2021 75. Turkiewicz, J. ∙ Bhatt, R.R. ∙ Wang, H. ... Altered brain structural connectivity in patients with longstanding gut inflammation is correlated with psychological symptoms and disease duration Neuroimage Clin. 2021; 30 :102613 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, we tested the possibility that inhibition of InsCtx activity may attenuate colon inflammation. We expressed in the InsCtx an inhibitory DREADD, Gi, in a Cre-independent manner and treated the mice with DSS in their drinking water while injecting them daily with CNO ( Figure 7 A). The reduction in InsCtx activity ( Figure 7 B) had a significant effect, attenuating clinical symptoms such as colon length ( Figures 7 C and 7D) and spleen weight ( Figure 7 E), but not all clinical and histological parameters were affected ( Figures 7 F–7H, S8 A, and S8B). DREADD-induced inhibition also had a significant effect on the immune response in the colon ( Figures 7 I–7O and S8 C–S8E), specifically, reducing the number of mucosal leukocytes ( Figures 7 I and 7M) and the percentage of TNF-α + leukocytes ( Figure 7 J), activated γδ ( Figure 7 K) and CD4 T cells ( Figures 7 L and 7N), and IL-6 + CD4 T cells ( Figure 7 O). Thus, we found that many, but not all, clinical and immune parameters were attenuated by the nonspecific InsCtx inhibition. This finding suggests that targeted manipulation of the InsCtx may be a therapeutic strategy to control colon inflammation.

Section: Discussion

Our data demonstrate that neurons in the InsCtx can acquire and retrieve specific immune-related information. In the field of neuroscience, this type of information encoding is reminiscent of memory traces ( Josselyn and Tonegawa, 2020 38. Josselyn, S.A. ∙ Tonegawa, S. Memory engrams: Recalling the past and imagining the future Science. 2020; 367 :eaaw4325 Crossref Scopus (464) PubMed Google Scholar ; ( Dudai, 2012 21. Dudai, Y. The restless engram: consolidations never end Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2012; 35 :227-247 Crossref Scopus (488) PubMed Google Scholar )). In recent years, such memory traces were demonstrated mostly by retrieval of fear-related behavior with the reactivation of hippocampal neuronal ensembles captured during fear conditioning ( Lacagnina et al., 2019 44. Lacagnina, A.F. ∙ Brockway, E.T. ∙ Crovetti, C.R. ... Distinct hippocampal engrams control extinction and relapse of fear memory Nat. Neurosci. 2019; 22 :753-761 Crossref Scopus (163) PubMed Google Scholar ; Liu et al., 2012 46. Liu, X. ∙ Ramirez, S. ∙ Pang, P.T. ... Optogenetic stimulation of a hippocampal engram activates fear memory recall Nature. 2012; 484 :381-385 Crossref Scopus (4) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ryan et al., 2015 69. Ryan, T.J. ∙ Roy, D.S. ∙ Pignatelli, M. ... Engram cells retain memory under retrograde amnesia Science. 2015; 348 :1007-1013 Crossref Scopus (447) PubMed Google Scholar ). Similarly, in our paradigm, reactivation of neurons captured under a unique inflammatory condition was sufficient to induce a related inflammatory response.
Numerous recent studies aim to understand the mechanisms that enable the brain to communicate directly with immune cells in the periphery ( Dantzer, 2018 16. Dantzer, R. Neuroimmune interactions: From the brain to the immune system and vice versa Physiol. Rev. 2018; 98 :477-504 Crossref Scopus (612) PubMed Google Scholar ; Huh and Veiga-Fernandes, 2020 35. Huh, J.R. ∙ Veiga-Fernandes, H. Neuroimmune circuits in inter-organ communication Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2020; 20 :217-228 Crossref Scopus (116) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kipnis, 2016 41. Kipnis, J. Multifaceted interactions between adaptive immunity and the central nervous system Science. 2016; 353 :766-771 Crossref Scopus (268) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, we focused on the potential mechanisms whereby the neuronal ensembles in the InsCtx can regulate local peripheral reactions, and we show that at least anatomically, these effects can be mediated via both arms of the autonomic nervous system. Subsequently, it will be interesting to identify the nature of the mechanisms that generate the diversity of the information delivered to the periphery, how it varies with context (e.g., analgesia), and how the peripheral anatomy is encoded by the autonomic nervous system. It will also be important to understand which peripheral cells receive the messages from the brain and whether they are received directly by immune cells or, alternatively, by the tissue’s parenchymal cells (e.g., colon epithelium), which may also contribute to the anatomical specificity of the induced immune responses.
A fundamental question is the nature of the evolutionary advantage for the organism in encoding such detailed and specific immune information. One possibility is that the brain, which constantly records external cues (e.g., place and odor), also records its own response to these experiences as a means to enable a more effective, anticipatory immune reaction to recurring stimuli. Nevertheless, such a potentially beneficial physiological response could also lead to maladaptive conditions. For example, it was shown almost 150 years ago that presenting patients allergic to pollen with an artificial flower is sufficient to induce an allergic response ( Mackeszie, 1886 47. Mackeszie, J.N. THE PRODUCTION OF THE SO-CALLED “ROSE COLD” BY MEANS OF AN ARTIFICIAL ROSE Am. J. Med. Sci. 1886; 181 :45-56 Crossref Google Scholar ). Moreover, many gut-related disorders are suggested to be psychosomatic in etiology, induced by emotionally salient experiences. The limited understanding of the underlying mechanisms of such disorders ( Dinan and Cryan, 2017 19. Dinan, T.G. ∙ Cryan, J.F. The Microbiome-Gut-Brain Axis in Health and Disease Gastroenterol. Clin. North Am. 2017; 46 :77-89 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (684) PubMed Google Scholar ; Enck et al., 2016 22. Enck, P. ∙ Aziz, Q. ∙ Barbara, G. ... Irritable bowel syndrome Nat. Rev. Dis. Primers. 2016; 2 :16014 Crossref Scopus (692) PubMed Google Scholar ; Moloney et al., 2015 52. Moloney, R.D. ∙ O’Mahony, S.M. ∙ Dinan, T.G. ... Stress-induced visceral pain: toward animal models of irritable-bowel syndrome and associated comorbidities Front. Psychiatry. 2015; 6 :15 Crossref Scopus (118) PubMed Google Scholar ) hampers the effectiveness of clinical interventions that are currently available. Our findings reveal the potential of inhibiting InsCtx activity as a means of suppressing peripheral inflammation. Thus, this study adds another perspective to the understanding of these pathological conditions and, presumably, an avenue for therapeutic intervention.

Section: Limitations of the study

This study introduces an experimental platform to study encoding of immune and physiological information in the brain. However, it is possible that the information that was encoded by the neuronal ensembles reflects sensory input from the tissue (gut or peritoneum) rather than a memory trace of the immune response. Such a phenomenon is distinct from the classical concept of memory.
Moreover, we focused on the InsCtx, but this brain region is most likely only a part of the neuronal representation of the immune-related information in the brain, and it does not exclude the possibility that other brain areas may be even more crucial for this process.

All experiments were performed in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals ( Garber et al., 2011 24. Garber, J.C. ∙ Barbee, R.W. ∙ Bielitzki, J.T. ... Guide for The Care and Use of Laboratory Animals The National Academies Press, 2011 Google Scholar ). All procedures and protocols were approved by the Technion Administrative Panel of Laboratory Animal Care. Male or female adult (8-12 weeks of age; 20-25 g) Fos TRAP1 (Jackson Laboratory; B6.129(Cg)- Fos tm1.1(cre/ERT2)Luo /J; stock #021882), Fos TRAP2 (Jackson Laboratory; Fos tm2.1(icre/ERT2)Luo /J; stock #030323) transgenic mice were used for the InsCtx activity-dependent labeling experiments; Ai14D mice (Jackson Laboratory; B6;129S6-Gt(ROSA)26Sor tm14(CAG-tdTomato)Hze /J; Stock #007908) were crossed with Fos TRAP2 for whole-brain activity-dependent labeling analysis; and C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Laboratory; C57BL/6J; stock #000664) were used for the characterization of the DSS-induced colitis, Zymosan-induced peritonitis, retrograde neuronal tracing and the Cre-independent InsCtx activation and inhibition experiments. Mice were maintained under specific-pathogen-free (SPF) conditions on a 12 h light: 12 h dark cycle (lights on at 07:00) and housed in groups of 2-5 mice per cage, with food and water ad libitum . In experiments including DSS-induced colitis, only male mice were used, due to previously documented sex-derived variability in this experimental model ( Bábíčková et al., 2015 3. Bábíčková, J. ∙ Tóthová, Ľ. ∙ Lengyelová, E. ... Sex Differences in Experimentally Induced Colitis in Mice: a Role for Estrogens Inflammation. 2015; 38 :1996-2006 Crossref Scopus (105) PubMed Google Scholar ). Otherwise, mice were randomly assigned to experimental groups.
Viral vectors and viral vector plasmids were designed and produced by the Viral Vector Facility (VVF) of the Neuroscience Center Zurich, UNC vector core and ELSC Vector Core Facility. For virus delivery, mice were anesthetized with a ketamine-xylazine mixture (ketamine 80 mg per kg body weight (mg/kg); xylazine 15-20 mg/kg; Sigma-Aldrich) in sterile saline (0.9% NaCl). After shaving and sterilization of the head, mice were placed on a sterile surgical pad on top of a heating pad. Ophthalmic ointment (Duratears, Alcon) was placed over the eyes to prevent dehydration and the incision site was sterilized. Upon loss of recoil paw compression, a midline incision was made from above the forehead to the ears line, exposing the skull. After skull exposure, mice were fixed in the stereotactic frame (Stoelting) and carefully drilled through the skull, just above the target injection site. Using a 10 μL syringe with a blunt metal needle (Nanofil), placed in a Stoelting Quintessential Stereotaxic Injector (QSI), we validated that the skull was straight at all plains. We then slowly lowered the syringe into the injection site and left the needle in place for 5 minutes, both before and after the injection. We injected 0.40 μL of virus (either AAV8-hSyn-DIO-hM3D(Gq)-mCherry, AAV8-hSyn-DIO-mCherry, AAV8-hSyn-hM3D(Gq)-mCherry, AAV8-hSyn-mCherry, AAV8-hSyn-hM4Di(Gi)-mCherry, or AAV1-EF1a-DIO-tdTomato) at 0.07 μL per min into the right posterior InsCtx (AP, −0.35 mm; ML, 4.0 mm; DV, −3.83 mm; relative to bregma). For double virus injections, a mixture of 0.15 μL of AAV8-hSyn-EGFP and 0.25 μL of AAV8-hSyn-DIO-mCherry per injection was used. Following injection, the incision was closed using a tissue adhesive (VetBond) and sterilized with Polydine ointment. Mice showing signs of physical distress and pain were excluded from the experiment. Further procedures of the experiments were performed at least 21 days after surgery to ensure the expression of the virus and to avoid analyzing the immediate immune response that could be induced by the injection itself. Stereotactic injection sites were verified using fluorescence microscopy.
For the induction of colon inflammation (colitis) during neuronal labeling, mice were administered 3% DSS (dextran sulfate sodium, TdB consultancy) in their drinking water for 84 h. This duration of DSS administration was chosen after calibration experiments and previous studies ( Chassaing et al., 2014 9. Chassaing, B. ∙ Aitken, J.D. ∙ Malleshappa, M. ...

Temporal and spatial analysis of clinical and molecular parameters in dextran sodium sulfate induced colitis PLoS ONE. 2009; 4 :e6073 Crossref Scopus (321) PubMed Google Scholar ), indicating that this time point was long enough for mice to exhibit signs of colon inflammation and yet, short enough to allow complete recovery within 4 weeks. In the InsCtx inhibition experiments ( Figure 7 ) 3% DSS was administered for 7 consecutive days. Fresh DSS solutions were prepared every 2 days. During the administration period, mice were monitored for their general condition: body weight, stool consistency, and signs of illness including hunched posture and dehydrated eyes and skin.
For peritonitis induction, we used Zymosan A prepared from Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell wall (Sigma-Aldrich). 20 mg of Zymosan were dissolved in 1 mL of sterile HBSS (without Ca +2 and Mg +2 , Biological Industries), during heating in a boiling water bath for 20 min. We sonicated the solution for 20 min, washed twice with HBSS (1200 rpm, 10 min) and resuspended in HBSS to a concentration of 20 mg/ml. The Zymosan solution was aliquoted and kept at −80°C. Upon use, the Zymosan solution was diluted in sterile PBS to a concentration of 20 μg/ml and a volume of 0.5 mL was administered to each mouse via intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections (10 μg of Zymosan per peritoneal cavity). As previously described ( Cash et al., 2009 8. Cash, J.L. ∙ White, G.E. ∙ Greaves, D.R. Chapter 17. Zymosan-induced peritonitis as a simple experimental system for the study of inflammation Methods Enzymol. 2009; 461 :379-396 Crossref Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ), this dose is sufficient to induce a well-characterized inflammatory response, which is confined to the peritoneal cavity, and resolves within 48 h after induction.
Tamoxifen (TM, Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in corn oil (Sigma-Aldrich) to a concentration of 20 mg/ml and kept at 4°C until use (up to 12 h). To enable a Cre-dependent expression of the target gene (either Gq-DREADD or fluorescent reporter) in active neurons, 150 mg/kg of the TM solution was injected i.p., 24 h prior to the immunological event of interest. In the colitis model TM was injected either 48 h before DSS administration, 48 h into DSS treatment, or 7 d after cessation (for capturing InsCtx neurons active during a healthy state, colitis or the recovery phase, respectively). In the peritonitis model TM was injected 48 h or 2 h before Zymosan administration (for capturing InsCtx neurons active during a healthy state or peritonitis, respectively).
4-Hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT, Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved at 20 mg/ml in ethanol by shaking at 37°C for 15 min and was then aliquoted and stored at −20°C for up to several weeks. Before use, 4-OHT was re-dissolved in ethanol by shaking at 37°C for 15 min, corn oil (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to give a final concentration of 10 mg/ml 4-OHT, and the ethanol was evaporated by vacuum using centrifugation. A dose of 50 mg/kg of the final 4-OHT solution was injected i.p., 30 min prior to the immunological event of interest (48 h before or right before Zymosan administration, with or without Acetaminophen).
To activate or inhibit DREADD-expressing neurons in the InsCtx (Gq or Gi, respectively), all mice were i.p. injected with CNO (1 mg/kg; Sigma-Aldrich) in sterile saline, 4 weeks after TM or 4-OHT administration. In the DSS experiments, CNO was injected for 4 (Gq-experiments) or 7 (Gi-experiments) days at 24-hour intervals; in the Zymosan experiments, a single dose of CNO was administered 24 h prior to euthanizing the mice. For c-Fos evaluation, an additional CNO injection was administered 90 min before euthanasia. Of note, in all experiments, mice in all groups were injected with CNO to control for the potential effects of CNO ( Rogan and Roth, 2011 68. Rogan, S.C. ∙ Roth, B.L. Remote control of neuronal signaling Pharmacol. Rev. 2011; 63 :291-315 Crossref Scopus (278) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Validation of the virus injection site, evaluation of DREADDs’ activity and c-Fos expression, analysis of neuronal phenotype in the brain, assessment of paneth cells and adhesion molecules, and validation of flow cytometry results in colonic tissues were performed by immunofluorescence staining and fluorescence microscopy. Mice were euthanized, and their brains or 1 cm of their distal colon were extracted and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 48 h, and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose solution (72 h). Coronal cryosections of the brains were sliced at 12 μm thickness and transverse sections of the colon were sliced at 8 μm thickness. These were then mounted on super-frost slides (Thermo scientific). For immunofluorescence, the mounted tissue sections were incubated in a blocking buffer (0.2% Triton X-100, 0.05% sodium azide, 4% bovine serum albumin in PBS) for 2 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer were added to the desired concentration and the slides were incubated at 4°C overnight. The following primary antibodies were used for brain sections: mouse anti-NeuN (1:400, Sigma-Aldrich), rabbit anti-GFAP (1:250, Agilent), Chicken anti-GFAP (1:1000, abcam), chicken anti-mCherry (1:500, abcam) or rat anti-CD11b (1:250, BioLegend). To evaluate c-Fos expression in the brain, mice were sacrificed 90 min after CNO injection and treated as described above. Fixed sections were incubated with anti-c-Fos antibody (1:2000, abcam). The sections of the colon were incubated with a rat anti-CD45 (1:250, BioLegend), rabbit anti-ZO1 (1:250, abcam), biotin-rat anti Ep-CAM (1:250, BioLegend), or rabbit anti-lysozyme (1:250, abcam). Following overnight incubation with primary antibody, slides were then washed in PBS 3 times for 15 min, and further incubated for 60 min at room temperature with a fluorescent-conjugated secondary antibody. The following secondary antibodies were used: Alexa Fluor 488-donkey anti-mouse IgG (1:500, Jackson ImmunoResearch laboratories); Cy5 goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:300, Jackson ImmunoResearch laboratories); Cy5 goat anti-rat IgG (1:300, Jackson ImmunoResearch laboratories); Alexa Fluor-568 goat anti-chicken (1:300, Invitrogen); Alexa Fluor-488 donkey anti-chicken IgG (1:500, Jackson ImmunoResearch laboratories); and Alexa Fluor-568 goat anti-rat IgG (1:300, Invitrogen). Slides were then washed in PBS 3 times for 15 min, mounted with DAPI-mounting medium (SouthernBiotech) and covered with a glass coverslip (Bar-Naor). All images were taken at 10 × or 20 × magnification using an Axio imager M2 microscope (Carl Zeiss Inc. US).
Mice were anesthetized with a ketamine-xylazine mixture (ketamine 80 mg per kg body weight (mg/kg); xylazine 15-20 mg/kg; Sigma-Aldrich) in sterile saline (0.9% NaCl). Injections of Pseudorabies virus Bartha strain 152 (PRV-152 (GFP), a gift from O. Kobiler) to the colon and peritoneum were performed by adaptation of the procedure previously described by Muller et al. (2020) 55. Muller, P.A. ∙ Schneeberger, M. ∙ Matheis, F. ... Microbiota modulate sympathetic neurons via a gut–brain circuit Nature. 2020; 583 :441-446 Crossref Scopus (231) PubMed Google Scholar . After shaving and sterilization of the abdomen, mice were placed on a sterile surgical pad on top of a heating pad. Ophthalmic ointment (Duratears, Alcon) was placed over the eyes to prevent dehydration and the incision site was sterilized. Upon loss of recoil paw compression, a midline incision was made through the abdominal wall, exposing the peritoneal cavity. For injection to the colon wall, colon was located, exposed for injection and held in place using two stabilized swabs. For injection to the peritoneal wall, the peritoneal wall was folded and held in place using a needle holder. We injected an overall 2 μL of virus with 0.1% FastGreen (Sigma-Aldrich) using a pulled glass micropipette placed in a 5 μL syringe (Hamilton) and a Stoelting Quintessential Stereotaxic Injector (QSI), into five different locations along the exposed tissue. Following injection, the abdominal wall and the skin were separately closed using absorbable sutures. Antibiotic ointment was applied to the closed surgical site and mice were given 0.05 mg/kg buprenorphine every 12 h for three days. Colons, peritoneal wall and brains were collected 7 d (for colon) or 6 d (for peritoneum) after injection.
Fos TRAP2 mice were stereotactically injected with AAV8-hSyn-DIO-mCherry (for colitis experiments) or AAV1-EF1α-DIO-tdTomato (for peritonitis experiments) into their InsCtx as described above. Upon recovery from the procedure, mice were administered TM injection i.p., to induce expression of the injection viral vector in recently activated neurons. For colon-injected mice, TM was injected 48 h into 3% DSS treatment, and for peritoneum-injected mice, TM was applied 2 h before Zymosan administration. After four weeks, we injected PRV–152 with 0.1% FastGreen into the proximal colon wall or peritoneal wall (as described in the previous section). Seven or six days later (for colon or peritoneal analysis, respectively), the colons, peritoneum and brains were collected for immunofluorescence analysis.
Colon, peritoneum and brains were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 48 h, and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose solution (72 h). Coronal cryosections of the brains were sliced at 12 μm thickness and sections of the colon and peritoneum were sliced at 8 μm thickness. For PRV immunofluorescence staining, the cryosections were treated as described in the previous section. Colon and peritoneum sections were stained with chicken anti-GFP (1:500, abcam), rabbit anti-β3 tubulin (1:500, abcam) and the secondary antibodies Alexa Fluor-488 donkey anti-chicken IgG (1:500, Jackson ImmunoResearch laboratories) and Alexa Fluor-568 donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:300, Invitrogen). Brain sections were stained with the primary chicken anti-GFP (1:500, abcam) and the secondary Alexa Fluor-488 donkey anti-chicken IgG (1:500, Jackson ImmunoResearch laboratories).
For histology staining, mice were sacrificed, and their colons were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS for 48 h, cryoprotected in 30% sucrose solution for another 48 h, and then frozen on dry ice. The colons were sliced in 8 mM sections and were mounted on super-frost slides (Thermo scientific). The slides were stained with Hematoxylin & Eosin (H&E). All images were taken using an automatic slide scanner (250 Flash III). The histological scoring was then performed by an investigator blinded to the treatment group of each sample. The components of the histological score were inflammatory infiltrate, goblet cell loss, crypt density, crypt hyperplasia, muscle thickening, submucosal inflammation, crypt abscess, and ulceration (as previously described in Koelink et al., 2018 43. Koelink, P.J. ∙ Wildenberg, M.E. ∙ Stitt, L.W. ... Development of Reliable, Valid and Responsive Scoring Systems for Endoscopy and Histology in Animal Models for Inflammatory Bowel Disease J. Crohn’s Colitis. 2018; 12 :794-803 Crossref Scopus (88) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Clinical severity of colitis was evaluated by monitoring the mice’s body weight throughout DSS administration, and assessing stool consistency, hematochezia and colon length at the day of euthanasia. Disease activity index score was quantified for mice in the InsCtx inhibition experiments (Figure S8) by an experimenter blinded to the experimental groups, based on the sum score of weight loss, stool consistency and presence of blood in stool (as previously described ( Park et al., 2015 57. Park, Y.H. ∙ Kim, N. ∙ Shim, Y.K. ... Adequate Dextran Sodium Sulfate-induced Colitis Model in Mice and Effective Outcome Measurement Method J. Cancer Prev. 2015; 20 :260-267 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar )).
Single molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) probes were designed using the Stellaris probe designer for GAD67 and SLC17A7 genes conjugated with Quasar670® fluorophore (Biosearch Technologies). The procedure was obtained using the manufacturer instructions for fresh frozen mouse brain tissue with minor adjustments. Brain cryosections (12 μm) were kept at −80°C until further procedures. Slides were fixed for 15 min in cold 4% PFA in PBS following PBS wash for 5 min twice. After being dipped in nuclease-free water and 3 min incubation in 2X saline-sodium citrate (SSC) buffer, slides were immersed in serial 3 min incubations in 70%, 95%, 100% ethanol and then 5 min of chloroform incubation. Then slides were immersed in 100% followed by 95% ethanol for 3 min each, and air-dried for 60-90 minutes.
Probes were diluted in Stellarris to a concentration of 250nM ( Slc17a7 ) or 375nM ( GAD67 ). Slides were then covered with hybridization buffer and kept in the dark at 37°C in a humidified chamber overnight. After incubation, slides were washed in Stellaris wash buffer A for 30 min in the dark and stained with DAPI (5 ng/ml in water) for 30 min in the dark, at room temperature. Slides were then washed for 3 min in Stellaris wash buffer B and then immersed in 50%, 85%, 100% ethanol for 3 minutes each. Slides were dried and mounted.
Whole brain clearing was performed following the iDISCO method as previously described ( Renier et al., 2014 66. Renier, N. ∙ Wu, Z. ∙ Simon, D.J. ... iDISCO: a simple, rapid method to immunolabel large tissue samples for volume imaging Cell. 2014; 159 :896-910 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1076) PubMed Google Scholar ) and updated at https://www.idisco.info/ . Briefly, after methanol dehydration, the brains were incubated with 5% H2O2 in methanol (MeOH) at 4°C overnight, followed by several washes in 100% methanol for 1 h. Samples were then incubated in a 66% dichloromethane (DCM, Bio-Lab) and 33% MeOH solution at room temperature, and then in 100% DCM for 15 min twice, while shaking (to rinse out any remaining MeOH). Tissues were stored in refractive index (RI) matching solution (RI = 1.56), Dibenzyl ether (DBE, Sigma-Aldrich) until imaging.
Whole-brain cleared samples were imaged while submerged in dibenzyl ether in a Light Sheet Fluorescent Microscope (LSFM, Lightsheet 7, Zeiss), using a 561 nm light-sheet illumination, a 5 × / 0.16 foc objective and 5 μm z-slices.
Mice were euthanized, and their blood, mesenteric lymph nodes (mLN), peritoneal lavage fluid (PLF) and colon (starting at the cecocolic junction proximally and ending at the anus distally) were collected. EDTA-coated tubes were used for blood collection, and centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 10 min. For blood cell analysis, 1 mL of blood was incubated with 9 mL of RBC Lysis buffer (BD biosciences) for 15 min and washed twice with PBS. mLN were dissociated in PBS into single-cell suspensions and mesh-filtered (40 μm) to remove fat tissue and debris. Peritoneal cells were collected via peritoneal lavage; 6 mL of cold PBS was carefully injected into the peritoneum and the cell-containing fluid was collected with a Pasteur pipette into 15 mL tubes. These were centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 5 min. PLF supernatant was extracted and frozen at −20°C for further protein analysis. The recovered cells were incubated for 3 min with 1 mL of Lysis buffer and washed once with PBS. In case of blood-contamination in PLF samples, these samples were excluded from the experiment. Colon tissue was mechanically dissociated into intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) and enzymatically dissociated into lamina propria (LP) single-cell suspensions using the Lamina propria dissociation kit (Miltenyi Biotec) and a GentelMacs Dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec). For viability staining, cells (10 6 ) were washed once with PBS, resuspended in Zombie Aqua™ dye solution (1:1,000, BioLegend) and incubated in the dark for 15 min at room temperature. For extracellular staining, cells were washed with FACS staining buffer (PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 1 mM EDTA and 0.05% sodium azide) and incubated with antibodies for 30 min at 4 °C. For Streptavidin-based staining, following extracellular staining, samples were washed twice and incubated for 25 min at 4 °C with fluorescently-conjugated streptavidin diluted to the desired concentration in FACS staining buffer. For intracellular staining, the samples were first stained for extracellular markers as described above, fixed and permeabilized with BD Cytofix/Cytoperm kit, and stained with the intracellular antibodies. The following mAbs were used (from Biolegend, San Diego, CA, US unless stated otherwise): Alexa Fluor-700 anti-CD45, Alexa Fluor-647 anti-TLR2, Biotin anti-TLR4 and Biotin anti-IL-12/IL-23, Biotin and Brilliant violet 650 anti-CD69, PE/Cy7 anti-IFN-γ, PerCP/Cy5.5 anti-CD11b, APC and APC/Cy7 anti-F4/80, FITC and Alexa Fluor 700 anti-Ly6G, Brilliant violet 510 anti-Gr-1, Brilliant violet 510 and FITC anti-Ly6C, PerCP and Alexa fluor 488 anti-CD8, APC and PE/Dazzle 594 anti CD4, PE/Cy7 and PE/Dazzle 594 anti-CD11c, Alexa Fluor-488 and Pacific blue anti-I-A/I-E, PE anti-TCRγδ, APC anti-TCRγδ, Pacific-blue anti-TCRβ, PE/Cy7 anti-CD25, Brilliant violet 605 anti-CD62L, Brilliant violet 510 anti-CD44, Brilliant-violet-605 anti-CD103, PE/Cy7 anti-CD19, Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated streptavidin (Jackson), Brilliant violet 605-conjugated streptavidin, FITC anti-TNFα, PE/Cy7 anti-IL-2, PerCP/Cy5.5 anti-IL-22, PE anti-IL-6, PE anti-IL-13 and Brilliant violet 510 anti-IL-17. All antibodies were validated by the manufacturers for flow application, as indicated on the manufacturers’ websites. After the incubation of the samples with the antibodies, the samples were washed twice with FACS staining buffer and re-suspended in 250 μl of 1% PFA. Samples were analyzed with a CytoFLEX S cell analyzer and FlowJo software. For visualization of the immune cell subsets that were analyzed, flow cytometry dataset was subjected to the unsupervised identification method, FlowSOM ( Gassen et al., 2015 25. Gassen, S. ∙ Van, Callebaut, B. ∙ Van Helden, M.J. ... FlowSOM: Using Self-Organizing Maps for Visualization and Interpretation of Cytometry Data Cytometry A. 2015; 87 :636-645 Crossref Scopus (1079) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, we concatenated an equal number of live CD45 + cells from IEL and LP tissues or PLF to generate a single FlowSOM tree.
For peritoneal lavage fluid (PLF) protein analysis, 6 mL of cold PBS were carefully injected into the peritoneum and the cell-containing fluid was collected with a Pasteur pipette into 15 mL tubes. These were centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 5 min. PLF supernatant was extracted and frozen at −20°C for further protein analysis. For colon protein analysis, a 200 mg piece of the tissue was collected from each mouse. These samples were homogenized in a PBS (1 mg: 2 μl) using stainless steel beads and the Bullet Blender Storm 24 (Next Advance), according to the recommended protocol at the manufacturer’s website ( nextadvance.com ). PLF supernatant and homogenized colon samples were analyzed using standard ELISA kits for TNF-α, IL-6, IL-17 and IL-10 (PeproTech).
Mice were euthanized, and their blood was collected into EDTA-coated tubes. These were then centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 10 min, and plasma was collected and frozen at −20°C until further analysis. On the day of analysis, samples were thawed and corticosterone and noradrenaline concentrations were measured in plasma, using the corticosterone (Enzo) and noradrenaline (IBL-America) ELISA kits.
Abdominal pain sensitivity was measured using Von Frey filaments as previously described ( Jain et al., 2020 37. Jain, P. ∙ Materazzi, S. ∙ De Logu, F. ... Transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 contributes to somatic pain hypersensitivity in experimental colitis Sci. Rep. 2020; 10 :8632 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, mice were randomly divided into 3 groups: 2 that were injected with Zymosan and 1 with PBS. 24 h later, one Zymosan-injected group received an Acetaminophen i.p. injection (300 mg/kg), and the other two groups received saline as a control for the analgesia. We chose Acetaminophen because it has relatively low anti-inflammatory effects (although it may have a direct effect on Kupffer cells), and it does not block the transition of neuronal inputs to the brain ( Jóźwiak-Bebenista and Nowak, 2014 39. Jóźwiak-Bebenista, M. ∙ Nowak, J.Z. Paracetamol: mechanism of action, applications and safety concern Acta Pol. Pharm. 2014; 71 :11-23 PubMed Google Scholar ).10 min later, mice were habituated in metal cubic compartments (13x15 cm 2 ) with a mesh bottom for 15 min. A blinded observer applied Von Frey filaments to the abdomen in ascending order starting at 0.02, 0.04, 0.07, 0.16, 0.4, and 0.6 g forces followed by the same descending order. Each filament was applied three times with maximal duration of 2-3 s, and a 5 s interval between each poke. The number of withdrawal responses (licking, retraction, or abdomen withdrawal) was quantified and summed for each mouse.
The graphical abstract was created with BioRender.com . All figures were created using Illustrator software (Adobe).
Statistical details for every experiment are provided in the figure legends, where n represents the number of animals per group (unless stated otherwise). Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05. Sample size was chosen based on calibration experiments to detect statistical significance under technical feasibility constrains.
Following immunofluorescence staining or smFISH, positive or double-positive cells for c-Fos, AAV (mCherry or GFP) PRV, GFAP, CD11b, NeuN, vGlut1 and GAD67 were counted manually using the ImageJ (fiji) Software ( Schindelin et al., 2012 70. Schindelin, J. ∙ Arganda-Carreras, I. ∙ Frise, E. ... Fiji: an open-source platform for biological-image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :676-682 Crossref Scopus (39998) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Following immunofluorescence staining, analysis was performed using ImageJ (fiji) Software in a double-blinded manner. Images were pre-processed manually by subtracting each image background intensity, as measured at a blank area in the same frame. Quantification was achieved by manually defining the region of interest (ROI) based on the tissue morphology: epithelium area for ZO-1 and EpCAM; mucosa for CD45 + cells; or colon crypts for lysozyme, and calculating mean intensities for all ROIs.
Quantification of the difference in TRAPed tdTomato + neurons in cleared whole-brains of inflamed and non-inflamed mice was performed by adapting the ClearMap pipeline ( Renier et al., 2016 67. Renier, N. ∙ Adams, E.L. ∙ Kirst, C. ... Mapping of Brain Activity by Automated Volume Analysis of Immediate Early Genes Cell. 2016; 165 :1789-1802 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (510) PubMed Google Scholar ), in which intensity for each brain area was compared between the two experimental groups.
In all experiments, significance levels of the data were determined using GraphPad PRISM 9.0.0 (121). We used two-tailed unpaired or paired Student’s t test when comparing two independent or dependent groups, respectively. For the comparison between more than two groups, we used one-way ANOVA if there was a single independent variable or two-way ANOVA for two-factorial designs (e.g., brain region x group). To further test pairwise differences between groups we used Tukey’s, Šídák’s or Benjamini, Krieger and Yekutieli Multiple comparisons tests (as specifically mentioned for every experiment in the figures legend). Data are represented as mean ± standard error of mean (s.e.m) or as median ± min/ max in the box and whiskers graphs (as stated in figure legends). Outliers were excluded using ROUT method for outlier identification ( Motulsky and Brown, 2006 54. Motulsky, H.J. ∙ Brown, R.E. Detecting outliers when fitting data with nonlinear regression - a new method based on robust nonlinear regression and the false discovery rate BMC Bioinformatics. 2006; 7 :123 Crossref Scopus (1033) PubMed Google Scholar ) with a False Discovery Rate less than 1% (Q < 1%). All experiments were performed at least twice.
