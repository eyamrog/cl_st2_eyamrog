Title: Genome design of hybrid potato


Abstract: Summary

Reinventing potato from a clonally propagated tetraploid into a seed-propagated diploid, hybrid potato, is an important innovation in agriculture. Due to deleterious mutations, it has remained a challenge to develop highly homozygous inbred lines, a prerequisite to breed hybrid potato. Here, we employed genome design to develop a generation of pure and fertile potato lines and thereby the uniform, vigorous F 1 s. The metrics we applied in genome design included the percentage of genome homozygosity and the number of deleterious mutations in the starting material, the number of segregation distortions in the S 1 population, the haplotype information to infer the break of tight linkage between beneficial and deleterious alleles, and the genome complementarity of the parental lines. This study transforms potato breeding from a slow, non-accumulative mode into a fast-iterative one, thereby potentiating a broad spectrum of benefits to farmers and consumers.

Section: Introduction

The most important tuber crop, potato ( Solanum tuberosum L.), is a staple food for some 1.3 billion people worldwide ( Stokstad, 2019 45. Stokstad, E. The new potato Science. 2019; 363 :574-577 Crossref Scopus (86) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, compared with other major crops, the genetic gains in potato have been small. The complexity of tetrasomic inheritance is the key factor hampering the genetic improvement of cultivated potato. For example, the 119-year-old Russet Burbank is still the foremost processing cultivar, despite it being susceptible to many major diseases ( Bethke et al., 2014 2. Bethke, P.C. ∙ Nassar, A.M.K. ∙ Kubow, S. ... History and origin of Russet Burbank (Netted Gem) a sport of Burbank Am. J. Potato Res. 2014; 91 :594-609 Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar ). Clonal propagation is another constraint for the potato industry, involving ~10% of the total production costs, and bears a very significant carbon footprint for tuber production associated with pest control, storage, and shipment to farmers.
To address these problems, several groups began efforts to re-invent potato into an inbred-line-based diploid crop, propagated by seeds ( Jansky et al., 2016 22. Jansky, S.H. ∙ Charkowski, A.O. ∙ Douches, D.S. ... Reinventing potato as a diploid inbred line–based crop Crop Sci. 2016; 56 :1412-1422 Crossref Scopus (148) Google Scholar ; Li et al., 2013 30. Li, Y. ∙ Li, G. ∙ Li, C. ... Prospects of diploid hybrid breeding in potato Chinese Potato. 2013; 27 :96-99 Google Scholar ; Lindhout et al., 2011 32. Lindhout, P. ∙ Meijer, D. ∙ Schotte, T. ... Towards F1 hybrid seed potato breeding Potato Res. 2011; 54 :301-312 Crossref Scopus (190) Google Scholar ). Actually, ~70% of the natural potato germplasm, including wild species and landraces, are diploid ( Spooner et al., 2014 43. Spooner, D.M. ∙ Ghislain, M. ∙ Simon, R. ... Systematics, diversity, genetics, and evolution of wild and cultivated potatoes Bot. Rev. 2014; 80 :283-383 Crossref Scopus (231) Google Scholar ), the extensive diversity of which has yet to be exploited. Sophisticated genetic populations, such as recombinant inbred lines (RILs), introgression lines (ILs), multi-parent advanced generation intercrosses populations (MAGICs), and nested association mapping populations (NAMs), can be developed using inbred lines of various lineages to facilitate trait gene discovery. Breeding with inbred lines is a fast and iterative process, using backcrossing to incorporate one or few beneficial alleles once in a generation, a process not amenable with auto-tetraploid breeding, which is essentially non-accumulative. Therefore, reinventing potato into a seed crop, hybrid potato, would lead to a “green revolution” in the potato industry, with immense benefits for consumers.
The concept of hybrid potato breeding is not new ( Almekinders et al., 2009 1. Almekinders, C.J.M. ∙ Chujoy, E. ∙ Thiele, G. The use of true potato seed as pro-poor technology: the efforts of an international agricultural research institute to innovating potato production Potato Res. 2009; 52 :275-293 Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar ), but it was long considered to be impractical. To make a hybrid of sufficient heterosis and uniformity, the two parental lines require high genome homozygosity, adequate vigor and fertility, and a reasonable degree of genetic divergence. In this regard, there are two major obstacles to be overcome. The first obstacle lies in the fact that most diploid lines are self-incompatible. A pioneer work here was the discovery and introgression of the S-locus inhibitor ( Sli ) gene, from the wild species S. chacoense , a dominant locus that renders self-compatibility in diploid potato, making selfing possible ( Hosaka and Hanneman, 1998 20. Hosaka, K. ∙ Hanneman, Jr., R.E. Genetics of self-compatibility in a self-incompatible wild diploid potato species Solanum chacoense . 2. Localization of an S-locus inhibitor ( Sli ) gene on the potato genome using DNA markers Euphytica. 1998; 103 :265-271 Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar ). Alternative solutions include using genome editing to knock out the S-RNase gene, a major determinant of self-incompatibility ( Enciso-Rodriguez et al., 2019 15. Enciso-Rodriguez, F. ∙ Manrique-Carpintero, N.C. ∙ Nadakuduti, S.S. ... Overcoming self-incompatibility in diploid potato using CRISPR-Cas9 Front. Plant Sci. 2019; 10 :376 Crossref Scopus (85) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ye et al., 2018 52. Ye, M. ∙ Peng, Z. ∙ Tang, D. ... Generation of self-compatible diploid potato by knockout of S-RNase Nat. Plants. 2018; 4 :651-654 Crossref Scopus (156) PubMed Google Scholar ), and searching for natural mutants of S-RNase ( Zhang et al., 2019 53. Zhang, C. ∙ Wang, P. ∙ Tang, D. ... The genetic basis of inbreeding depression in potato Nat. Genet. 2019; 51 :374-378 Crossref Scopus (106) PubMed Google Scholar ). More difficult to solve is the second obstacle, inbreeding depression, mainly caused by deleterious recessive alleles, whose detrimental effects would be exposed through selfing ( Charlesworth and Willis, 2009 8. Charlesworth, D. ∙ Willis, J.H. The genetics of inbreeding depression Nat. Rev. Genet. 2009; 10 :783-796 Crossref Scopus (1392) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, elimination of deleterious mutations is crucial for development of pure inbred lines.
However, even in a self-compatible diploid clone, purging of deleterious mutations, to obtain a highly homozygous inbred line, is not as straightforward as expected. After the initial successful conceptual test of hybrid potato breeding, by researchers at the Solynta Company and Wageningen University ( Lindhout et al., 2011 32. Lindhout, P. ∙ Meijer, D. ∙ Schotte, T. ... Towards F1 hybrid seed potato breeding Potato Res. 2011; 54 :301-312 Crossref Scopus (190) Google Scholar ), over the ensuing decade of selfing and selection, the homozygosity of inbred lines remained low. Recently, a self-compatible diploid inbred line, termed “Solyntus,” was de novo assembled, but unfortunately, > 20% of the Solyntus genome is still heterozygous, even for this F 9 inbred line ( van Lieshout et al., 2020 49. van Lieshout, N. ∙ van der Burgt, A. ∙ de Vries, M.E. ... Solyntus, the new highly contiguous reference genome for potato ( Solanum tuberosum ) G3 (Bethesda). 2020; 10 :3489-3495 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ). In practical breeding, 20% of genome heterozygosity means too many traits will be segregating; hence, this low homozygosity will limit the uniformity and commercialization of any resultant F 1 hybrids ( Stokstad, 2019 45. Stokstad, E. The new potato Science. 2019; 363 :574-577 Crossref Scopus (86) PubMed Google Scholar ). Clearly, these outcomes indicate that the conventional selfing and selection approach, as a breeding strategy, is ineffective in achieving the highly anticipated breeding outcomes.
The reason why it is difficult to develop elite inbred lines, with high homozygosity, is due to the nature of the potato genome. One could argue that, during the 1930s, elite maize inbred lines were already generated ( Duvick, 2005 13. Duvick, D.N. The contribution of breeding to yield advances in maize ( Zea mays L.) Adv. Agron. 2005; 86 :83-145 Crossref Scopus (891) Google Scholar ). Maize, as a diploid, can be propagated efficiently by sexual reproduction, and therefore deleterious alleles with large effect were most likely eliminated prior to inbred line development. In contrast, potato has been propagated asexually through vegetative tubers for thousands of years, and hence, deleterious alleles with large effect are “hidden” in the genome, at the heterozygous state ( Lian et al., 2019 31. Lian, Q. ∙ Tang, D. ∙ Bai, Z. ... Acquisition of deleterious mutations during potato polyploidization J. Integr. Plant Biol. 2019; 61 :7-11 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhou et al., 2020 55. Zhou, Q. ∙ Tang, D. ∙ Huang, W. ... Haplotype-resolved genome analyses of a heterozygous diploid potato Nat. Genet. 2020; 52 :1018-1023 Crossref Scopus (134) PubMed Google Scholar ), as also shown in other clonally propagated crops ( Zhou et al., 2019 54. Zhou, Y. ∙ Minio, A. ∙ Massonnet, M. ... The population genetics of structural variants in grapevine domestication Nat. Plants. 2019; 5 :965-979 Crossref Scopus (176) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, inbreeding depression in clonally propagated plants is expected to be more severe than that in seed plants, which increases the difficulties to develop inbred lines.
A recent haplotype-resolved genome map of RH89-039-16 (RH), a heterozygous diploid potato line, showed that deleterious alleles were dispersed throughout both haplotypes ( Zhou et al., 2020 55. Zhou, Q. ∙ Tang, D. ∙ Huang, W. ... Haplotype-resolved genome analyses of a heterozygous diploid potato Nat. Genet. 2020; 52 :1018-1023 Crossref Scopus (134) PubMed Google Scholar ), which further complicates strategies to eradicate deleterious alleles, or to stack beneficial alleles, via meiotic recombination. Phenotypic selection would be difficult to break the linkage of two tightly linked deleterious mutations in the repulsion phase, resulting in the high heterozygosity of inbred lines, even after multiple generations of selfing. To overcome these obstacles in developing elite inbred lines, an in-depth understanding of the potato genomes is required.
In this study, we show how to develop pure inbred lines and vigorous F 1 hybrids, through genome design, which applies genome analyses for decision making in the entire process of inbred line development and creation of F 1 s.

Section: Results

We developed a pipeline to carry out potato hybrid breeding by genome design ( Figure 1 ). This pipeline involved four steps, with the first being to select or create, as starting materials, self-compatible diploid clones with low genomic heterozygosity. The second step involved analysis of the S 1 population of this starting material to identify the segregation distortion regions (SDs) and genetic loci carrying large-effect deleterious mutations or controlling agronomic traits. Next, it is critical to develop highly homozygous inbred lines, by continuous selfing and genome-assisted selection, to purge deleterious mutations and stack beneficial alleles. Finally, the inbred lines, derived from different lineages, are crossed and F 1 hybrids then evaluated for performance. In the following sections we document the experimental platforms employed to establish this pipeline to develop pure potato inbred lines and vigorous F 1 hybrids.
In nature, nearly all diploid potatoes are self-incompatible, which is controlled by the highly polymorphic S-RNase alleles ( Takayama and Isogai, 2005 47. Takayama, S. ∙ Isogai, A. Self-incompatibility in plants Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2005; 56 :467-489 Crossref Scopus (532) PubMed Google Scholar ). To develop inbred lines from heterozygous diploid clones, it is necessary to break self-incompatibility. In this study, we used four diploid clones, belonging to different subgroups ( Figure S1 ), to create inbred lines. PG6359 and RH are two natural self-compatible accessions, which have previously been reported ( Clot et al., 2020 9. Clot, C.R. ∙ Polzer, C. ∙ Prodhomme, C. ...

Peterson, B.A. ∙ Holt, S.H. ∙ Laimbeer, F.P.E. ... Self-fertility in a cultivated diploid potato population examined with the Infinium 8303 potato single-nucleotide polymorphism array Plant Genome. 2016; 9 :1-13 Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar ; Zhang et al., 2019 53. Zhang, C. ∙ Wang, P. ∙ Tang, D. ... The genetic basis of inbreeding depression in potato Nat. Genet. 2019; 51 :374-378 Crossref Scopus (106) PubMed Google Scholar ). The self-compatibility in PG6359 was conferred by a low-expressed S-RNase allele, S s11 ( Zhang et al., 2019 53. Zhang, C. ∙ Wang, P. ∙ Tang, D. ... The genetic basis of inbreeding depression in potato Nat. Genet. 2019; 51 :374-378 Crossref Scopus (106) PubMed Google Scholar ). For the other two clones, CIP701165 and CIP703767, they were self-incompatible, which was overcome by introgression of the Sli gene from a breeding line E172 ( Figures S2 A and S2B). Two BC 1 clones, C10-20 and E86-69, derived from CIP701165 and CIP703767, respectively, were selected to develop inbred lines. Development of these inbred lines, carrying different self-compatibility genes, could avoid the detrimental effects of any deleterious mutations, linked with either self-compatibility gene, being exposed in the F 1 hybrids.
Another crucial feature of the starting material is the number of deleterious mutations. Such deleterious substitutions were predicted based on amino acid conservation, using the SIFT algorithm ( Vaser et al., 2016 50. Vaser, R. ∙ Adusumalli, S. ∙ Leng, S.N. ... SIFT missense predictions for genomes Nat. Protoc. 2016; 11 :1-9 Crossref Scopus (891) PubMed Google Scholar ). We analyzed the genomes of 153 diploid clones and found that genomic heterozygosity is positively correlated with the number of deleterious mutations ( Figure 2 A). Among the four clones used in this study, PG6359 and E86-69 harbor relatively less mutations. Genomic analysis revealed that PG6359 contains several large homozygous segments ( Zhang et al., 2019 53. Zhang, C. ∙ Wang, P. ∙ Tang, D. ... The genetic basis of inbreeding depression in potato Nat. Genet. 2019; 51 :374-378 Crossref Scopus (106) PubMed Google Scholar ), covering 12.17% of the entire genome. Since this clone is self-compatible, we inferred that some large-effect deleterious mutations had been purged, either during selfing or inbreeding. Likewise, due to backcrossing, some genomic regions in E86-69 were already homozygous ( Figure S2 C), covering 35.47% of the entire genome. Using these two clones, we could successfully develop highly homozygous inbred lines.
However, for RH and C10-20, we failed to develop inbred lines. These two clones contain relatively more deleterious mutations ( Figure 2 A), and their progeny became very weak and seldom flowered after two generations of selfing. Analysis of a small S 1 population from each clone showed that the SDs in RH and C10-20 are more than that in PG6359 and E86-69 ( Figure 2 B), which increases the difficulty in developing pure inbred lines. Thus, the starting material, with lower heterozygosity and fewer deleterious mutations, offers a greater potential for development into inbred lines.
The second step in the genome design pipeline is to carry out genetic analyses using the S 1 population of the starting material. Here, we will use the diploid clone PG6359 as an example to illustrate how to develop homozygous inbred lines from a heterozygous diploid clone. We sequenced 825 S 1 individuals of PG6359, among which 256 plants could set fruit after artificial self-pollination. Then we analyzed the genome-wide SDs, at the seedling and fruit-setting stages. The SDs on chromosome 1 (chr. 1), chr. 3, and chr. 12 were found to be the same at both developmental stages ( Figures S3 A and S3B), indicating that these SDs are associated to the early-stage characters, such as gametic or zygotic survival, growth vigor, etc. In a previous study, we mapped the self-compatibility gene S s11 and the leaf chlorosis gene yl1 on chr. 1 and chr. 12, respectively ( Zhang et al., 2019 53. Zhang, C. ∙ Wang, P. ∙ Tang, D. ... The genetic basis of inbreeding depression in potato Nat. Genet. 2019; 51 :374-378 Crossref Scopus (106) PubMed Google Scholar ). At the fruit-setting stage, an additional SD was detected on chr. 2 ( Figure S3 B), implicating it as being related to fertility or other late-stage traits.
Due to the reliance on asexual propagation in potato, some genes controlling fertility were negatively selected ( Hardigan et al., 2017 19. Hardigan, M.A. ∙ Laimbeer, F.P.E. ∙ Newton, L. ... Genome diversity of tuber-bearing Solanum uncovers complex evolutionary history and targets of domestication in the cultivated potato Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :E9999-E10008 Crossref Scopus (236) PubMed Google Scholar ), an important point for consideration, as fertility is a crucial factor to the development of inbred lines. In addition, because of inbreeding depression, some selfed progeny showed very weak fertility or male sterility. Understanding these deleterious mutations affecting fertility is essential for developing inbred lines. In the progeny of PG6359, the floral buds of some plants aborted before flowering; this trait was designated as floral bud abortion 1 ( fba1 ) ( Figure 3 A). Very few flowers on these plants blossomed, and for those that did, their pollen was sterile.
Bulked segregant analysis revealed that fba1 was controlled by a single locus on chr. 2, which co-localized with the SD on chr. 2 ( Figure 3 B). Further studies mapped fba1 to a 11 kb interval containing three annotated genes ( Figure 3 C; Table S1 ). Among them, PGSC0003DMG400021719, encoding a bHLH transcription factor, was specifically expressed in the stamen and its expression was depressed in mutant plants ( Figure S3 C; Figure 3 D). The Arabidopsis orthologous gene DYT1 is required for anther development ( Cui et al., 2016 10. Cui, J. ∙ You, C. ∙ Zhu, E. ... Feedback regulation of DYT1 by interactions with downstream bHLH factors promotes DYT1 nuclear localization and anther development Plant Cell. 2016; 28 :1078-1093 Crossref Scopus (85) PubMed Google Scholar ). Knockout of StDYT1 in potato resulted in the same phenotype as fba1 ( Figures 3 E and 3F), so we confirmed that StDYT1 regulates stamen development in potato and its mutation represents a major deleterious allele affecting fertility.
The selfed progeny of PG6359 also showed diverse variations in tuber-related traits, with tuber size and tuber number per plant showing a continuous distribution ( Figures S3 D and S3E), indicating that these traits are controlled by multiple loci. In contrast, tuber shape and flesh color exhibited characteristics of qualitative traits. Bulked segregant analysis located the locus controlling round tuber shape to chr. 10 ( Figure S3 F), corresponding to the Ro gene ( Bonierbale et al., 1988 3. Bonierbale, M.W. ∙ Plaisted, R.L. ∙ Tanksley, S.D. RFLP maps based on a common set of clones reveal modes of chromosomal evolution in potato and tomato Genetics. 1988; 120 :1095-1103 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Van Eck et al., 1994 48. Van Eck, H.J. ∙ Jacobs, J.M.E. ∙ Stam, P. ... Multiple alleles for tuber shape in diploid potato detected by qualitative and quantitative genetic analysis using RFLPs Genetics. 1994; 137 :303-309 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). As long and round tuber shapes have different commercial values, and no SD colocalizes with this trait, both haplotypes were kept in our breeding project. The locus controlling flesh color was mapped to chr. 3 ( Figure S3 G), corresponding to the Y gene ( Kloosterman et al., 2010 23. Kloosterman, B. ∙ Oortwijn, M. ∙ uitdeWilligen, J. ... From QTL to candidate gene: genetical genomics of simple and complex traits in potato using a pooling strategy BMC Genomics. 2010; 11 :158 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ). The yellow flesh allele Y , located on haplotype B, controls carotenoid accumulation, a nutritional trait. In addition, the haplotype A, carrying the white flesh allele y , showed distorted segregation ( Figure S3 B), indicating that it is linked with a large-effect deleterious mutation. Thus, the haplotype A needs to be purged during the development of inbred lines.
Based on the above genetic analyses, we designed a pipeline to eliminate deleterious or undesirable alleles as well as stack beneficial alleles. First, we selected S 1 individuals carrying four beneficial alleles ( S s11 for self-compatibility, YL1 for normal leaves, FBA1 for fertility, and Y for yellow flesh) to be selfed. Next, we assessed the performance and homozygosity of the resultant S 2 plants to select individuals with relatively high homozygosity and desired traits for seed collection. Finally, using the same selection criteria, the resultant population was further self-pollinated, for 2–4 times, to ultimately obtain inbred lines with high homozygosity.
The average genome homozygosity of S 1 plants was 48.32%, varying from 19.30% to 74.76%. We selected 86 S 1 individuals, containing the above four traits, to develop inbred lines. About 9,000 S 2 plants were transplanted into the greenhouse, and at the seedling stage, all plants with leaf chlorosis or weak growth vigor were removed. The remaining plants were manually self-pollinated. Based on growth vigor, fruit setting, and tuber-related traits, 116 S 2 individuals were selected and re-sequenced. Unexpectedly, we observed a peak of heterozygous regions at the end of chr. 12 (ST4.03ch12: 60,229,075–61,165,650) ( Figure 4 A). Among the selected 116 S 2 plants, 107 were heterozygous at this locus. As haplotype B carries the deleterious allele yl1 , its homozygotes were discarded at the seedling stage. But the homozygous haplotype A was also seldom selected, so we re-analyzed this locus using the S 1 population. Here, we found that the homozygous haplotype A showed significantly distorted segregation, the ratio of which is only 1.98%, far below a quarter ( Figure 4 B). This indicates haplotype A contains a large-effect deleterious mutation, affecting the survival of homozygotes, designated as large-effect deleterious mutation 1 ( led1 ). To develop inbred lines, it is necessary to break the tight linkage between these two deleterious mutations in repulsion phases.
Fortunately, due to the relatively high recombination rate at the end of chr. 12, we identified four S 1 recombinants in this region. The leaf color of the recombinant R1 was green, and its S 2 progeny showed segregation in their leaf color, indicating that yl1 was located downstream of bin128 ( Figure 4 C). Leaf color of the recombinant R2 and its S 2 progeny was green, and its S 2 progeny showed distorted segregation in bin124, suggesting that the other deleterious mutation, led1 , was located upstream of bin125 ( Figure 4 D). According to the genotype and phenotype of these two S 1 recombinants and their S 2 progeny, we concluded that the close linkage between two deleterious mutations was broken. In the S 2 population, we obtained nine individuals carrying the beneficial alleles, LED1 and YL1 , in the coupling phase ( Figure 4 E), all of which were derived from the R2 recombinant. This demonstrates that, with phenotype-based selection, it is sometimes impossible to identify and purge the closely linked deleterious mutations in the repulsion phases. In this case, genomic analysis and selection is essential.
Although the average homozygosity of S 2 plants increased to 72.76% ( Figure 5 A), the number of heterozygous regions had not decreased (p = 0.81) ( Figure 5 B). We further found that the number of crossovers in the S 2 progeny increased by 50.21% (p = 1.40 × 10 −33 ) ( Figure 5 C), indicating that new crossovers occurred within heterozygous regions. For example, in a heterozygous region on chr. 1, a total of 11 crossovers were detected in 9 S 2 individuals from the same family ( Figure S4 A). To accelerate the purification of inbred lines, those S 2 plants with genome homozygosity <70% were eliminated, and seeds of the remaining 79 plants were sown. Finally, 44 S 3 families (~8,000 plants) with high germination rate were transplanted for further study.
According to the same selection process, this population continued to be selfed for a further two generations. Finally, we obtained multiple highly homozygous inbred lines carrying the beneficial alleles ( Figure 5 D). The average homozygosity of S 5 plants was raised to 97.54% (91.79%–99.94%) ( Figure 5 A). With an increase in homozygosity, in advanced inbred lines, the number and length of the heterozygous regions in each generation consistently underwent a decrease. In the S 5 generation, more than 95% of the heterozygous regions were shorter than 10 Mb ( Figures S4 B and S4C).
Employing the same pipeline, we also developed inbred lines using a vigorous and self-compatible clone, E86-69. Among 500 S 1 plants of E86-69, 262 individuals bearing fruit, by selfing, were re-sequenced and used to construct the bin map. Only two regions with strong SD were identified (c 2 test, p < 1E−10) ( Figure S5 A). The number of SDs is crucial for developing inbred lines; lower SDs facilitate development of inbred lines. No visible phenotypic defect was linked with the SD on chr. 4 and hence we only selected the beneficial haplotype, at this locus, and did not perform further analyses. In another study, we confirmed that the SD on chr. 12 was caused by the self-compatibility gene Sli (Y. Shang et al., personal communication). Only the pollen carrying the Sli gene could penetrate the style and complete the double fertilization, whereas growth of pollen tubes without Sli was inhibited, which caused the observed segregation distortion. According to this mechanism, all selfed progeny were self-compatible. Thus, it was unnecessary to make selections at this locus.
The average homozygosity of S 1 plants was 63.85%, varying from 43.16% to 81.25% ( Figure S5 B). The seeds from 44 S 1 plants, with homozygosity >70%, were germinated for developing inbred lines. After another two generations of selfing, the average homozygosity was increased to 91.85% and 23 S 3 plants had homozygosity higher than 95% ( Figure S5 B). Different from the PG6359 population, the number of heterozygous regions in the E86-69 population consistently decreased along with the continuous increase of crossovers ( Figures S5 C and S5D).
With the availability of two sets of inbred lines, derived from different lineages, we made crosses between them ( Figure S6 A; Table S2 ). As expected, the performance of F 1 hybrids between homozygous inbred lines was very uniform, whereas those derived from heterozygous parental lines showed a great segregation in tuber traits ( Figure S6 A). Moreover, the inbred-line-based F 1 hybrids had strong heterosis in growth vigor and yield in the greenhouse ( Figures 6 A and 6B). Compared with parental lines, the yield of these F 1 hybrids was increased by at least 31% ( Figure 6 C). For the combination A6-10 × E4-64, the F 1 hybrid yield was 3.38 times that of the mid-parent value.
The mini-tubers, harvested from true-seed plants, were grown in the field, in Dehong (24°43′N and 98°58′E), Yunnan Province, to test the yield potential of these F 1 hybrids. Due to severe inbreeding depression, the resultant inbred lines performed very weakly in the field, and only a few tubers could be harvested. In contrast, the F 1 plants grew well under these field conditions, and the average yield was twice that obtained in the greenhouse ( Figure 6 D). Furthermore, these F 1 tubers were rich in carotenoids (59.63–72.06 mg∙kg -1 fry weight) and dry matter (23.10%–26.02%) ( Figure 6 E; Table S2 ). Unexpectedly, due to the self-compatibility and recovered fertility, the F 1 hybrids produced abundant fruits ( Figure 6 D; Figure S6 B), which competed with the underground tubers for nutrients.
To preliminarily explore the genetic basis of heterosis in F 1 hybrids, we de novo assembled the genomes for the two parents of the F 1 hybrid H1, A6-26 (homozygosity = 98.16%) and E4-63 (homozygosity = 98.52%), using Pacbio HiFi reads. The assembled genome sizes of A6-26 and E4-63 were 748 Mb (contig N50 = 2.64 Mb) and 740 Mb (contig N50 = 3.89 Mb), respectively ( Table S3 ). More than 98% of the sequences of these two genomes were categorized and anchored to 12 super-scaffolds, representing 12 pseudo-chromosomes, and some 97% of embryophyta BUSCO genes could be aligned to each assembly. The average alignment rate of transcriptome data from A6-26 and E4-63 was 97.46% and 97.75%, respectively. These data demonstrated the high continuity and completeness of these two genomes. We annotated 37,948 and 37,214 high-confidence protein-coding genes for A6-26 and E4-63, respectively. Comparisons with the potato reference genome DM1-3 516 R44 (hereafter referred as DM) revealed 12,023 specifically identified genes in these two inbred lines ( Figure S7 ). As DM is male-sterile and has defects in tuber development, these two inbred lines could be used as reference genomes to study fertility and tuber development of potato, as well as other important biological processes.
In addition, we also compared the genetic variants between DM and these two inbred lines. For each assembly, some three million variants were identified ( Table 1 ). The overlapped SNP, indels, and structural variations between A6-26 and E4-63 were 11.55%, 11.35%, and 16.91%, respectively, indicating that nearly 90% variants should be heterozygous in their F 1 hybrid. We further predicted 10,994 and 11,093 deleterious substitutions in A6-26 and E4-63, respectively, but only 8.36% were overlapped, suggesting that the detrimental effects of most deleterious substitutions will be masked in F 1 hybrid. These deleterious substitutions involve 7,414 genes, among which 2,217 genes showed differential expression in the tubers of A6-26 and E4-63. The genomic complementarity of two inbred lines, to some extent, may explain the heterosis of the F 1 hybrid.

Section: Discussion

The core mission of hybrid potato breeding is to develop highly homozygous inbred lines derived from different lineages. High residual heterozygosity, in inbred lines, will result in segregations in the F 1 hybrids, reducing their commercial quality. Here, we used genome design approach to facilitate inbred line development, and therefore, hybrid potato breeding. In contrast to traditional phenotype-based selection, we employed the following metrics in genome design. First, we evaluated the percentage of genome homozygosity and the number of deleterious mutations in the starting material. The material with lower genome heterozygosity and less deleterious mutations indicates a greater potential for development into inbred lines. Second, we inferred the number of SDs present in the genome, by sequencing the S 1 population, as these are often associated with large-effect deleterious alleles. Third, we selected the plants containing the beneficial alleles and analyzed the haplotype information to infer the break of tight linkage between beneficial and deleterious alleles; we also evaluated the genome homozygosity and selected individuals with relatively high homozygosity for continued selfing. Lastly, we calculated the genome complementarity of inbred lines to choose the parental lines for vigorous F 1 hybrid production.
Some SDs do not colocalize with visible morphological defects, which can only be identified and purged by genomic selection. In addition, by analyzing the segregation of different genotypes and the co-localized deleterious traits, we could then infer whether there were large-effect deleterious alleles, closely linked in repulsion phases. This situation is common in the potato genome, such as the two detrimental alleles, ar1 and ws1 , on chr. 1 of the heterozygous diploid clone RH ( Zhou et al., 2020 55. Zhou, Q. ∙ Tang, D. ∙ Huang, W. ... Haplotype-resolved genome analyses of a heterozygous diploid potato Nat. Genet. 2020; 52 :1018-1023 Crossref Scopus (134) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this study, we also identified two linked deleterious mutations in repulsion phases at the end of chr. 12. Due to the high recombination rate in this region, their linkage could be broken. However, in cases that might occur in the low-recombination region, especially in the pericentromeric region, it would be difficult to break this linkage and obtain highly homozygous inbred lines.
It is important to note that, in this study, we identified only deleterious mutations with large effects that could easily be identified by SDs or obvious morphological defects. However, inbred lines carrying the beneficial alleles, at all these loci, still showed reduced growth vigor, fertility, and yield, compared with the original heterozygous diploid clone. This indicates that the inbred lines accumulated many homozygous deleterious mutations of minor or medium effects, the harmful effects of which were exposed and caused severe fitness costs. To effectively identify deleterious mutations, it is necessary to have a deep understanding of the potato genomes, from an evolutionary perspective. To this end, we are working with international teams to sequence multiple species representing the diversity of the Solanaceae family. In the long run, by the development and employment of improved algorithms, we may develop the capacity to predict the minor- to medium-effect deleterious mutations for repair by genome editing.
In this study, by crossing two inbred lines, derived from different sub-species, we achieved F 1 hybrids displaying strong heterosis. A recent pilot field trial in Dehong, Yunnan Province, showed good performance of such F 1 tubers, grown from mini-tubers directly harvested from true-seed plants. According to a plot trial (90 plants), the estimated tuber yield of these F 1 hybrids is on the order of 40 tons per hectare (60,000 plants), close to the yield of Lishu 6 (~45 tons per hectare), the major tetraploid variety grown in this region, with 65% coverage of the local cultivated area. Here, it is important to note that these F 1 hybrids also produced abundant fruits, which led to a reduction in resources available for tuber growth. Hence, further increases in the yield of these diploid hybrids could be achieved either through adjustments in resource allocation to their tubers, or inhibition of fruit development.
The yield potential of the diploid potato is considerable. The yield potential of 295 diploid germplasms was tested in the abovementioned Dehong field trial in the winter of 2019. Among these tested lines, the average single plant yield (SPY) of 20 accessions was higher than that for the tetraploid cultivar Lishu 6 (SPY = 1.05 kg) ( Table S4 ), which was grown as a control. However, knowledge regarding the genetic control over yield remains sparse. Although many yield QTLs have been reported ( Bonierbale et al., 1993 4. Bonierbale, M.W. ∙ Plaisted, R.L. ∙ Tanksley, S.D.

With the development of the first generation of inbred lines, we now have an opportunity to identify and clone such high yield genes at the diploid rather than at the tetraploid level. Genome-assisted backcrossing, a routine process employed in seed crops, now enters the toolbox of potato breeding. When they are identified, we could achieve the introgression of one or a few such yield genes within 2 years, including one cross, two backcrosses, and one selfing. In this manner, we anticipate overcoming the yield gap between the diploid hybrid potato and tetraploid cultivars in 2–3 rounds of introgressions.
Clearly, potato hybrid breeding is still in its infancy. Genome design will attract the next generation of potato breeders who will collectively transform potato breeding from a slow non-accumulative mode into a fast-iterative mode, making potato both a more productive crop and a more nutritious food. We even anticipate that hybrid breeding and genome design will transform potato into a non-host to its most devasting disease, the late blight, making it a more environmentally friendly crop.
Lower genome heterozygosity and less deleterious mutations are two standards of selecting starting materials but cannot guarantee the successful development of highly homozygous inbred lines. Although some advanced inbred lines developed by genome design don’t harbor large-effect deleterious mutations, they might accumulate too many minor-effect deleterious mutations, which lead to weak growth vigor and male sterility. Thus, the breeders should select multiple starting materials in practical breeding. In addition, the accuracy of predicted deleterious mutations needs to be further enhanced by improved algorithms in the future.

The deleterious mutations datasets ( Figure 2 A) and the genotype file for Principal Component Analysis ( Figure S1 ) are available from the following ftp link: ftp://ftp.agis.org.cn/∼zhangchunzhi/ . The genotype files of different generations of inbred lines have been deposited in the Genome Variation Map (GVM) in the Big Data Center, Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Science, under accession number GVM000101 and are publicly accessible at https://bigd.big.ac.cn/gvm/getProjectDetail?Project=GVM000101 . The scripts of parent-independent genotyping of diploid potato were deposited in GitHub https://github.com/DieTANG/PiGBS_Pipeline .
The potato seeds, tubers or tissue culture plantlets were grown in the greenhouses of CAAS-YNNU Joint Academy of Potato Sciences, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming (24°52′N and 102°49′E) in the growth season from 2017-2020. The field test of inbred lines and F 1 hybrids was carried out in Dehong (24°43’N and 98°58’E), Yunnan province, China in the winter of 2020.
Four diploid potato accessions, S. tuberosum RH, S. tuberosum group Stenotomum PG6359 (the original CIP code is CIP705468) and CIP701165, S. tuberosum group Phureja CIP703767, were used for genetic analysis in this study ( Figure S1 ). Among them, RH was kindly provided by the department of Plant Breeding, Wageningen University, and the other three clones were kindly provided by the International Potato Center. RH and PG6359 are two self-compatible clones ( Zhang et al., 2019 53. Zhang, C. ∙ Wang, P. ∙ Tang, D. ... The genetic basis of inbreeding depression in potato Nat. Genet. 2019; 51 :374-378 Crossref Scopus (106) PubMed Google Scholar ). CIP701165 and CIP703767 are self-incompatible, which were crossed with E172 (containing the S-locus inhibitor gene, Sli ). Then the F 1 clones were backcrossed with female parents, and two BC 1 clones (C10-20 derived from CIP701165 and E86-69 derived from CIP703767) with good growth vigor and fruit-setting rate were chosen for genetic analyses and continual selfing ( Figure S2 A and S2B). To evaluate the genome homozygosity and mutation burden, 153 diploid potatoes were used, including two BC 1 clones (C10-20 and E86-69) and 151 accessions that have been reported in our previous study ( Zhang et al., 2019 53. Zhang, C. ∙ Wang, P. ∙ Tang, D. ... The genetic basis of inbreeding depression in potato Nat. Genet. 2019; 51 :374-378 Crossref Scopus (106) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Total DNA was isolated from fresh leaves and subjected to genome re-sequencing, using the Illumina HiSeq X Ten or NovoSeq platforms. The insert size of the libraries was 250~300 bp, and the read length was 150 bp. For parental clones, PG6359, RH, C10-20 and E86-69, ~20 Gb clean data were generated, and for each selected progeny, ~2 Gb clean data were generated. Short reads were aligned against the potato reference genome DM1-3 516 R44 (DM) (V4.03) ( PGSC, 2011 39. PGSC, Potato Genome Sequencing Consortium Genome sequence and analysis of the tuber crop potato Nature. 2011; 475 :189-195 Crossref Scopus (1612) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sharma et al., 2013 41.

Li, H. Aligning sequence reads, clone sequences and assembly contigs with BWA-MEM arXiv. 2013; 1303.3997 Google Scholar ), and SNPs were extracted using Samtools ( Li et al., 2009 29. Li, H. ∙ Handsaker, B. ∙ Wysoker, A. ... The Sequence Alignment/Map (SAM) Format and SAMtools Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :1653-1654 Crossref Scopus (38872) Google Scholar ) and BCFtools ( https://github.com/samtools/bcftools ). Deduction of two haplotypes of the parental clone, construction of bin maps, and analysis of segregation distortions were performed, according to our previous study ( Zhang et al., 2019 53. Zhang, C. ∙ Wang, P. ∙ Tang, D. ... The genetic basis of inbreeding depression in potato Nat. Genet. 2019; 51 :374-378 Crossref Scopus (106) PubMed Google Scholar ). The genome homozygosity of selfed progenies was calculated using the following formula: H o m o z y g o s i t y = L e n g t h o f h o m o z y g o u s b i n s P o t a t o g e n o m e s i z e × 1 0 0 %
All potato materials used in this study were grown under greenhouse conditions. To evaluate the phenotype of the S 1 population of PG6359, three clones for each genotype were transplanted in the greenhouse. At the flowering stage, floral bud abortion was observed by eye. When the tubers were harvested, tuber shape was visually scored as ‘1’ (round), ‘0’ (long), or ‘-’ (not sure), and tuber flesh color was visually scored as ‘1’ (yellow), ‘0’ (white), or ‘-’ (not sure). For these three qualitative traits, the corresponding genetic loci were mapped by bulked segregant analyses ( Takagi et al., 2013 46. Takagi, H. ∙ Abe, A. ∙ Yoshida, K. ... QTL-seq: rapid mapping of quantitative trait loci in rice by whole genome resequencing of DNA from two bulked populations Plant J. 2013; 74 :174-183 Crossref Scopus (1000) PubMed Google Scholar ). Tuber number refers to the sum of tubers with diameter of transection ≥20 mm collected from three replicates. Tuber weight of four F 1 hybrids and their parents refers to the average tuber weight per plant with diameter of transection ≥10 mm.
To fine map the FBA1 gene, the heterozygous Insertions/Deletions (InDels) in PG6359, with index 0.3~0.7 and length 2~50 bp, were extracted, using Platypus (V0.7.4) ( Manary et al., 2014 33. Manary, M.J. ∙ Singhakul, S.S. ∙ Flannery, E.L. ... Identification of pathogen genomic variants through an integrated pipeline BMC Bioinformatics. 2014; 15 :63 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ). The 150-bp flanking sequences of InDels were extracted and used to design polymorphic markers. More than 5000 S 1 individuals of PG6359 were used to narrow down the candidate region of FBA1 . Total RNA from the anthers of young floral buds was extracted, using an RNAprep Pure Plant Kit (TIANGEN, China). About 1mg of total RNA was used for First-strand cDNA synthesis (PrimeScript RT reagent Kit with gDNA Eraser, TaKaRa, Japan, Cat#RR047A). RT-qPCR was conducted by using the ABI StepOne-Plus System and TB Green Premix Ex Taq (TaKaRa, Japan), following the manufacturer’s instructions. Relative expression of the candidate genes was calculated using the 2 -DDCt method. To knock out the candidate gene, the single guide RNA was designed and incorporated into the CRISPR/Cas9 vector, pKSE401, using Bsa I (NEB, USA, Cat#R3535) and T4 DNA Ligase (NEB, USA, Cat#M0202S) ( Xing et al., 2014 51. Xing, H.L. ∙ Dong, L. ∙ Wang, Z.P. ... A CRISPR/Cas9 toolkit for multiplex genome editing in plants BMC Plant Biol. 2014; 14 :327 Crossref Scopus (1098) PubMed Google Scholar ). The agrobacterium-mediated method was used to transform the stem nodes of potato ( Ye et al., 2018 52. Ye, M. ∙ Peng, Z. ∙ Tang, D. ... Generation of self-compatible diploid potato by knockout of S-RNase Nat. Plants. 2018; 4 :651-654 Crossref Scopus (156) PubMed Google Scholar ). Primers used for cloning the FBA1 gene are shown in Table S1.
Carotenoid analysis, including lutein, zeaxanthin and b-carotene, was performed according to that described by Huang et al. (2018) 21. Huang, W. ∙ Lin, Y. ∙ He, M. ... Induced High-Yield Production of zeaxanthin, lutein, and beta-carotene by a mutant of chlorella zofingiensis J. Agric. Food Chem. 2018; 66 :891-897 Crossref Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar . Briefly, 200 mg lyophilized tuber was extracted with acetone until they were almost colorless. The extracts were filtered through a 0.22 mm Millipore organic membrane and then were analyzed by an Agilent Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography (UHPLC) 1290 Infinity. To separate lutein and zeaxanthin, a liquid chromatography method was developed in which UHPLC was equipped with a Waters YMC Carotenoid C30 column (5 mm, 4.6 × 250 mm), and the mobile phase consisted of solvent A (methanol) and solvent B (methyl tertiary butyl ether). At a flow rate of 1.0 mL∙min -1 , 10 mL of each sample was analyzed in a gradient mode (0-45 min: linear gradient of 0%–15% of B; 40-45 min: linear gradient of 15%–60% of B; 55-60 min: linear gradient of 60%–70% of B; 60-62 min: linear gradient of 70%–0% of B). Compounds were detected at 480, 450, and 280 nm, and the retention times, absorption spectra, and peak area of each pigment were compared with authentic compounds.
To predict the deleterious substitutions of 153 diploid accessions, ~10 × genome sequences of each clone were used to extract SNPs. The index of heterozygous SNPs was ≥0.3 and ≤0.7, and that of homozygous SNPs was ≥0.9 or ≤0.1. Amino acid substitutions and their effects on protein function were predicted with the SIFT algorithm ( Vaser et al., 2016 50. Vaser, R. ∙ Adusumalli, S. ∙ Leng, S.N. ... SIFT missense predictions for genomes Nat. Protoc. 2016; 11 :1-9 Crossref Scopus (891) PubMed Google Scholar ). An amino acid substitution was predicted to be deleterious if the score was ≤0.05 and tolerated if the score was > 0.05. To predict the deleterious substitutions in two inbred lines, A6-26 and E4-63, the assembled contigs were aligned to the DM genome (V4.03) and used to call SNPs.
Genomic DNA was extracted from in vitro -propagated seedlings. Each SMRTbell library was constructed using the Pacific Biosciences SMRTbell template prep kit 1.0. The constructed libraries were size-selected on a BluePippin system, followed by primer annealing and the binding of SMRT bell templates to polymerases with the DNA/Polymerase Binding Kit.
Sequencing was carried out on the Pacific Bioscience Sequel II platform at Annoroad Gene Technology company (Beijing, China). HiFi reads were generated, using the PacBio tools package, pbccs ( https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/ccs ), with default parameters. HiFi reads were assembled by Flye V2.7.1 (–pacbio-hifi–keep-haplotypes) ( Kolmogorov et al., 2019 24. Kolmogorov, M. ∙ Yuan, J. ∙ Lin, Y. ... Assembly of long, error-prone reads using repeat graphs Nat. Biotechnol. 2019; 37 :540-546 Crossref Scopus (2284) PubMed Google Scholar ). Hi-C data were aligned to the assemblies by Juicer software ( Durand et al., 2016 12. Durand, N.C. ∙ Shamim, M.S. ∙ Machol, I. ... Juicer provides a one-click system for analyzing Loop-resolution Hi-C experiments Cell Syst. 2016; 3 :95-98 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1703) PubMed Google Scholar ), while super-scaffolds were anchored by 3d-dna pipeline ( Dudchenko et al., 2017 11. Dudchenko, O. ∙ Batra, S.S. ∙ Omer, A.D. ... De novo assembly of the Aedes aegypti genome using Hi-C yields chromosome-length scaffolds Science. 2017; 356 :92-95 Crossref Scopus (1333) PubMed Google Scholar ).
RepeatMasker was used to mask the repeat sequences. The pipeline for annotation included ab initio prediction, homolog prediction and transcripts annotation. GeneMark ( Bruna et al., 2020 6. Bruna, T. ∙ Lomsadze, A. ∙ Borodovsky, M. GeneMark-EP+: eukaryotic gene prediction with self-training in the space of genes and proteins NAR Genom. Bioinform. 2020; 2 :lqaa026 Crossref Scopus (226) PubMed Google Scholar ), SNAP ( Korf, 2004 25. Korf, I. Gene finding in novel genomes BMC Bioinformatics. 2004; 5 :59 Crossref Scopus (2041) PubMed Google Scholar ) and AUGUSTUS V3.3 ( Stanke et al., 2004 44. Stanke, M. ∙ Steinkamp, R. ∙ Waack, S. ... AUGUSTUS: a web server for gene finding in eukaryotes Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32 :W309-12 Crossref Scopus (906) PubMed Google Scholar ) were used for ab initio prediction. Exonerate was used for homolog prediction. RNA-seq were aligned to the assemblies, using HISAT2 V2.1.0 ( Pertea et al., 2016 36. Pertea, M. ∙ Kim, D. ∙ Pertea, G.M. ... Transcript-level expression analysis of RNA-seq experiments with HISAT, StringTie and Ballgown Nat. Protoc. 2016; 11 :1650-1667 Crossref Scopus (3950) PubMed Google Scholar ), and expression levels were quantified, using StringTie V1.3.6 ( Pertea et al., 2015 35. Pertea, M. ∙ Pertea, G.M. ∙ Antonescu, C.M. ... StringTie enables improved reconstruction of a transcriptome from RNA-seq reads Nat. Biotechnol. 2015; 33 :290-295 Crossref Scopus (7184) PubMed Google Scholar ). Transcripts were assembled by Trinity and used as training model for the PASA pipeline ( Grabherr et al., 2011 16. Grabherr, M.G. ∙ Haas, B.J. ∙ Yassour, M. ... Full-length transcriptome assembly from RNA-Seq data without a reference genome Nat. Biotechnol. 2011; 29 :644-652 Crossref Scopus (14990) PubMed Google Scholar ; Haas et al., 2003 17. Haas, B.J. ∙ Delcher, A.L. ∙ Mount, S.M. ... Improving the Arabidopsis genome annotation using maximal transcript alignment assemblies Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31 :5654-5666 Crossref Scopus (1341) PubMed Google Scholar ). Finally, all predicted evidence was integrated, by EVidenceModeler V1.1.1 ( Haas et al., 2008 18. Haas, B.J. ∙ Salzberg, S.L. ∙ Zhu, W. ... Automated eukaryotic gene structure annotation using EVidenceModeler and the Program to Assemble Spliced Alignments Genome Biol. 2008; 9 :R7 Crossref Scopus (2039) PubMed Google Scholar ), to generate the final annotation gene set.
Variants, including SNPs, insertions, deletions, and structural variations of the two assemblies and DM reference genome (V4.03) were carried out by the smartie-sv pipeline ( Kronenberg et al., 2018 26. Kronenberg, Z.N. ∙ Fiddes, I.T. ∙ Gordon, D. ... High-resolution comparative analysis of great ape genomes Science. 2018; 360 :360 Crossref Scopus (237) PubMed Google Scholar ). Alignments were launched by a modified version of BLASR ( Chaisson and Tesler, 2012 7. Chaisson, M.J. ∙ Tesler, G. Mapping single molecule sequencing reads using basic local alignment with successive refinement (BLASR): application and theory BMC Bioinformatics. 2012; 13 :238 Crossref Scopus (844) PubMed Google Scholar ), which was designed to align large divergent contigs against a reference genome.
The core and specific gene sets of the two de novo assemblies and DM reference genome (V4.03) were estimated based on OrthoFinder V2.3.3 ( Emms and Kelly, 2015 14. Emms, D.M. ∙ Kelly, S. OrthoFinder: solving fundamental biases in whole genome comparisons dramatically improves orthogroup inference accuracy Genome Biol. 2015; 16 :157 Crossref Scopus (2150) PubMed Google Scholar ) (-S mmseqs -T raxml -M msa) gene family clustering results. Unassigned genes were defined as the specific genes for each accession.
The statistical details of experiments can be found in the figure legends, including the statistical tests used, exact value of n. Comparisons for two groups were calculated using the unpaired two-tailed Student’s t tests, and statistical analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel 2019. Results are represented as mean ± SD. P values < 0.01 were considered significant, with levels of significance as follows: ∗∗ p < 0.01.
