Title: Dual film-like organelles enable spatial separation of orthogonal eukaryotic translation


Abstract: Summary

Engineering new functionality into living eukaryotic systems by enzyme evolution or de novo protein design is a formidable challenge. Cells do not rely exclusively on DNA-based evolution to generate new functionality but often utilize membrane encapsulation or formation of membraneless organelles to separate distinct molecular processes that execute complex operations. Applying this principle and the concept of two-dimensional phase separation, we develop film-like synthetic organelles that support protein translation on the surfaces of various cellular membranes. These sub-resolution synthetic films provide a path to make functionally distinct enzymes within the same cell. We use these film-like organelles to equip eukaryotic cells with dual orthogonal expanded genetic codes that enable the specific reprogramming of distinct translational machineries with single-residue precision. The ability to spatially tune the output of translation within tens of nanometers is not only important for synthetic biology but has implications for understanding the function of membrane-associated protein condensation in cells.

Section: Introduction

How living systems develop ever more complex processes and acquire new features is not only a central question in evolutionary biology but is also an essential consideration for synthetic biologists striving to create new and complex functionalities in a living host. A common evolutionary mechanism is the duplication of genes or even whole genomes. This creates redundant biomolecules, which can undergo divergence, giving rise to new functions ( Blomme et al., 2006 11. Blomme, T. ∙ Vandepoele, K. ∙ De Bodt, S. ... The gain and loss of genes during 600 million years of vertebrate evolution Genome Biol. 2006; 7 :R43 Crossref Scopus (260) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lynch and Conery, 2003 62. Lynch, M. ∙ Conery, J.S. The Origins of Genome Complexity Science. 2003; 302 :1401-1404 Crossref Scopus (1082) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ohno, 1970 72. Ohno, S. Evolution by Gene Duplication Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 1970 Crossref Google Scholar ). Intriguingly, duplicated genes are often deleted, and recent studies have shown that paralogous genes can more readily diverge if their functional and structural entanglement is comparatively weak ( Kuzmin et al., 2020 54. Kuzmin, E. ∙ VanderSluis, B. ∙ Nguyen Ba, A.N. ...

Wapinski, I. ∙ Pfeffer, A. ∙ Friedman, N. ... Natural history and evolutionary principles of gene duplication in fungi Nature. 2007; 449 :54-61 Crossref Scopus (478) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, to develop new functionalities, it often seems necessary that genes become orthogonal and do not cross-react with ancestral biomolecules. For synthetic biology applications in cells, such orthogonality is generally essential to prevent interference with the endogenous processes of the host, and it can be a daunting task to develop this de novo for molecules that have many interaction partners. Furthermore, creating enzymes that specifically execute desired functions de novo is challenging ( Almhjell et al., 2018 3. Almhjell, P.J. ∙ Boville, C.E. ∙ Arnold, F.H.

Lechner, H. ∙ Ferruz, N. ∙ Höcker, B. Strategies for designing non-natural enzymes and binders Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2018; 47 :67-76 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, alternative strategies for generating orthogonal enzymes inside a cell would be extremely useful.
One powerful tool that synthetic biologists have for creating new functions in vivo is genetic code expansion (GCE), which has been widely used to site-specifically incorporate noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) into proteins in vivo ( Chin, 2017 20. Chin, J.W. Expanding and reprogramming the genetic code Nature. 2017; 550 :53-60 Crossref Scopus (301) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lemke, 2014 57. Lemke, E.A. The exploding genetic code ChemBioChem. 2014; 15 :1691-1694 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ; Liu and Schultz, 2010 60. Liu, C.C. ∙ Schultz, P.G. Adding new chemistries to the genetic code Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2010; 79 :413-444 Crossref Scopus (1170) PubMed Google Scholar ). The genetic code determines how genomic information is transferred into a polypeptide sequence through the central dogma and relies on aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS)/tRNA pairs to decode triplet codons into specific amino acids. These pairs have extensive protein-RNA and, in the case of multimeric aaRS systems, protein-protein interaction surfaces. Engineering functional derivatives is thus a formidable challenge. Hence, to repurpose aaRS/tRNA pairs to encode noncanonical functionalities in a particular host, aaRS/tRNA pairs from highly evolutionarily distinct organisms are typically used, a few of which are orthogonal to the new host machinery. Here, orthogonal refers to a given aaRS accepting only a specific ncAA, and then only aminoacylating it to its cognate tRNA. In addition, the cognate tRNA should not be recognized as a substrate by any of the endogenous tRNA synthetases.
For GCE of mammalian cells, the most commonly used pyrrolysyl tRNA synthetase/tRNA pairs (PylRS/tRNA Pyl ) are derived from methanogenic archaea (for reviews, see Reinkemeier and Lemke [2020] 83.

These are orthogonal in both eukaryotes and bacteria and have been evolved in the laboratory to incorporate a diverse set of ncAAs, with which one can, for example, control protein function with light ( Gautier et al., 2010 32.

Genetic incorporation of multiple unnatural amino acids into proteins in mammalian cells Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2013; 52 :14080-14083 Crossref Scopus (125) PubMed Google Scholar ). The tRNA Pyl is typically chosen to decode a comparatively rare stop codon (e.g., the amber TAG codon, which terminates the translation of 20% of all proteins in humans), hence this technology is also termed amber suppression. This stop codon is inserted site-selectively into the coding sequence of a protein of interest (POI) so that the full-length protein is only formed with the ncAA installed at the chosen site.
For the simultaneous incorporation of multiple different ncAAs in eukaryotes, GCE technology is fundamentally limited by three problems: (1) the translational process lacks mRNA specificity such that other mRNAs in the transcriptome that naturally terminate at amber codons can be mistranslated; (2) the number of codons that can be reassigned without altering host functionality is limited; and (3) the dearth of orthogonal aaRS/tRNA pairs.
We recently published a solution to the first of these problems: membraneless orthogonally translating (OT) organelles that are formed by phase separation and targeting to microtubule plus-ends to afford a micron-sized organelle ( Reinkemeier et al., 2019 84. Reinkemeier, C.D. ∙ Girona, G.E. ∙ Lemke, E.A. Designer membraneless organelles enable codon reassignment of selected mRNAs in eukaryotes Science. 2019; 363 :eaaw2644 Crossref Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ). We define the term organelle as a spatially distinct site in the cell, regardless of its structure or appearance, which nevertheless executes a specific function and has a composition distinct from its surroundings. Phase separation occurs at above the critical concentrations of certain proteins that were fused to PylRS and the ms2 bacteriophage coat protein (MCP), an RNA-binding protein ( Reinkemeier et al., 2019 84. Reinkemeier, C.D. ∙ Girona, G.E. ∙ Lemke, E.A. Designer membraneless organelles enable codon reassignment of selected mRNAs in eukaryotes Science. 2019; 363 :eaaw2644 Crossref Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although the suppressor tRNA itself is a relatively small molecule, the PylRS-loaded organelle efficiently recruits it, leading to a very high concentration inside the condensate and a very low concentration throughout the rest of the cell. The POI mRNA is labeled in the 3′ untranslated region with specific RNA motifs (ms2 loops) that are bound by MCP, thus leading to recruitment of the mRNA into the organelle. Because only the ribosomes processing the recruited mRNA are exposed to a very high concentration of suppressor tRNA Pyl , it is preferentially translated according to an expanded genetic code. By contrast, ribosomes translating mRNA elsewhere in the cell terminate translation once the chosen stop codon is encountered, because no tRNA Pyl is available. Note that the translational machinery requires that a few hundred factors work smoothly together and no component other than the PylRS and MCP were fused to the organelle scaffold. Thus, despite sharing all other components of translation with the cytoplasm, from which these components are essentially freely accessible, we detected up to 8-fold selectivity for amber suppression of targeted (i.e., ms2 tagged) versus untargeted mRNAs. We also showed that the same logic could be applied to reprogramming the opal or ochre codon. Hereafter, we refer to this particular OT organelle-based GCE technology as being mRNA selective ( Reinkemeier et al., 2019 84. Reinkemeier, C.D. ∙ Girona, G.E. ∙ Lemke, E.A. Designer membraneless organelles enable codon reassignment of selected mRNAs in eukaryotes Science. 2019; 363 :eaaw2644 Crossref Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The other two aforementioned issues remain difficult to resolve in eukaryotes. The scarcity of free codons has been addressed in E. coli by using various means, for example, whole-genome synthesis ( Fredens et al., 2019 30. Fredens, J. ∙ Wang, K. ∙ de la Torre, D. ...

However, these approaches are not readily transferred to eukaryotes, which have much larger and more complex genomes than E. coli , and their ribosomes use an alternative mechanism of mRNA recognition.
As mentioned, only a handful of orthogonal aaRS/tRNA pairs are available, and these have achieved varying degrees of success in eukaryotes ( Beránek et al., 2018 8.

Although the evolution approach is powerful, the discovery rate of new orthogonal aaRS/tRNA pairs is low. This issue is not limited to enzyme evolution for GCE but is inherent to enzyme engineering generally.
In this paper, we show that we can use two-dimensional protein condensation at various membrane surfaces to establish multiple, film-like biochemical microenvironments in which we can tune the language of protein translation at the sub-resolution scale. We thus developed several OT film-like organelles, which enabled us to design multiple spatially orthogonal aaRS/tRNA pairs within the same cytoplasm. This allowed us to reuse the same stop codon to incorporate distinct ncAAs into different proteins in vivo , effectively generating a cell with three spatially and functionally distinct translational programs. We further discuss the implications of these results for membrane signaling and membrane-associated phase separation.

Section: Results

The aim of this work is to assign one stop codon (amber, TAG) to a different ncAA in each film-like organelle inside the same cell; hence each full-length POI will be produced only if their programmed ncAA is added to the growth medium (ncAA X [blue heptagon] to POI1 [green] and ncAA Y [yellow star] to POI2 [red] in Figure 1 A).
To achieve this, besides the amber suppressor aaRS/tRNA pair being orthogonal to the host machinery, the orthogonality of multiple, mutually orthogonal OT organelles inside the same cell should be 3-fold ( Figure 1 B). First, the organelles should form independently and not intermix; we term this the “independent assembly” criterion. This criterion considerably extends the previously described general requirement that the mRNA targeted to the organelle is not efficiently translated elsewhere in the cytoplasm by the host’s canonical translation machinery ( Reinkemeier et al., 2019 84. Reinkemeier, C.D. ∙ Girona, G.E. ∙ Lemke, E.A. Designer membraneless organelles enable codon reassignment of selected mRNAs in eukaryotes Science. 2019; 363 :eaaw2644 Crossref Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ). Second, each OT organelle must recruit a specific subset of mRNAs; this is the “selective RNA recruitment” criterion. Third, each aaRS variant in a respective organelle should selectively utilize a distinct ncAA; this defines the “distinct ncAA specificity” criterion.
We addressed each of these criteria in turn. First, we needed to construct a number of spatially distinct OT organelles. The previously developed micron-sized synthetic organelles were approximately half the size of a cell nucleus and thus occupied a substantial portion of the cytoplasm ( Reinkemeier et al., 2019 84. Reinkemeier, C.D. ∙ Girona, G.E. ∙ Lemke, E.A. Designer membraneless organelles enable codon reassignment of selected mRNAs in eukaryotes Science. 2019; 363 :eaaw2644 Crossref Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ). Fitting two of these organelles into one cell and ensuring they are immiscible was expected to be a challenge.
We thus aimed to construct OT organelles that condense as thin-film-like layers on a membrane. We designed these condensates to form on the cytoplasmic face of a cellular membrane to facilitate exchange with the cytoplasm. To achieve this, we combined a phase-separation domain with a membrane localization domain and fused them directly to the PylRS or the RNA-binding proteins (we use “::” to denote a genetic fusion and “•” to denote a co-expression). We used the proteins fused in sarcoma (FUS) and Ewing sarcoma breakpoint region 1 (EWSR1) as phase-separating proteins ( Altmeyer et al., 2015 4. Altmeyer, M. ∙ Neelsen, K.J. ∙ Teloni, F. ...

We previously demonstrated that these can serve as organelle assemblers in vivo and define an assembler as an organelle-forming moiety ( Reinkemeier et al., 2019 84. Reinkemeier, C.D. ∙ Girona, G.E. ∙ Lemke, E.A. Designer membraneless organelles enable codon reassignment of selected mRNAs in eukaryotes Science. 2019; 363 :eaaw2644 Crossref Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ). We then localized the condensates to different membranes by fusing them to: • the N-terminal domain of the rodent LCK tyrosine kinase to direct them to the plasma membrane (PM) ( Zlatkine et al., 1997 111. Zlatkine, P. ∙ Mehul, B. ∙ Magee, A.I. Retargeting of cytosolic proteins to the plasma membrane by the Lck protein tyrosine kinase dual acylation motif J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110 :673-679 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) • the N-terminal domain of human EBAG9 to localize them to the Golgi membrane (GM) ( Engelsberg et al., 2003 26. Engelsberg, A. ∙ Hermosilla, R. ∙ Karsten, U. ... The Golgi protein RCAS1 controls cell surface expression of tumor-associated O-linked glycan antigens J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278 :22998-23007 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ) • the N-terminal domain of rabbit cytochrome P450 2C1 (CYPIIC1) to direct them to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (ERM) ( Hung et al., 2017 45. Hung, V. ∙ Lam, S.S. ∙ Udeshi, N.D. ... Proteomic mapping of cytosol-facing outer mitochondrial and ER membranes in living human cells by proximity biotinylation eLife. 2017; 6 :e24463 Crossref Scopus (142) PubMed Google Scholar ) • the N-terminal domain of human TOM20 for targeting to the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) ( Stavru et al., 2006 90. Stavru, F. ∙ Nautrup-Pedersen, G. ∙ Cordes, V.C. ... Nuclear pore complex assembly and maintenance in POM121- and gp210-deficient cells J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173 :477-483 Crossref Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We refer to these four systems by the abbreviations PMP, GMP, ERMP, and OMMP (the suffix P indicates that the systems also contain a phase-separating moiety; for an overview of these systems, see Figures 1 C–1G).
We used a previously described dual-color ms2 reporter in fluorescence flow cytometry (FFC) studies to assess if these organelles are indeed OT, that is, they selectively undertake GCE and translate a targeted mRNA of our POI that the cytoplasm does not ( Reinkemeier et al., 2019 84. Reinkemeier, C.D. ∙ Girona, G.E. ∙ Lemke, E.A. Designer membraneless organelles enable codon reassignment of selected mRNAs in eukaryotes Science. 2019; 363 :eaaw2644 Crossref Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this reporter, both EGFP 39TAG and mCherry 190TAG are expressed independently (i.e., each has an expression cassette with its own promotor) but from one plasmid with amber codons at the indicated permissive sites. Only the mCherry mRNA is tagged with ms2 loops. In case of cytoplasmic GCE, different mRNAs cannot be distinguished, and the amber codon is suppressed in both EGFP and mCherry. This leads to the appearance of a diagonal population of green and red fluorescent cells in the double logarithmic axis FFC plots ( Figure 2 A, left). By contrast, if an OT organelle is working selectively, only mCherry is translated with an expanded genetic code, whereas the untargeted EGFP is terminated if the amber codon is encountered and thus is not fluorescent. This leads to a vertical mCherry-positive population in FFC ( Figure 2 A, right). Based on FFC data, we can calculate the fold change in selectivity and the relative efficiency of each system. The fold change in selectivity is defined as the mean mCherry signal divided by the mean EGFP signal of a given system normalized to the respective ratio for the cytoplasmic GCE system (PylRS). Analogously, the relative efficiency is defined as the mean mCherry signal of a given system normalized to the mean mCherry signal of cytoplasmic PylRS. In the STAR Methods , we discuss the robustness of this reporter analysis against a variety of factors that might affect translational efficiency, brightness, instrument settings, and so forth.
We used this reporter to evaluate the performance of all membrane-localized organelles in cells. We observed a vertical, mCherry-positive population by FFC for all four systems ( Figure 2 B). Compared to the cytoplasmic GCE system, this corresponds to selectivities of 9- to 12-fold for the targeted protein, and we achieved efficiencies of up to 45% ( Figure 2 D). Thus, we conclude that these four OT film-like organelles can perform highly selective and orthogonal translation of the targeted mRNA::ms2. The best of these systems compared favorably to our previous best-performing, micron-sized OT organelle (OT K2::P1 , a combination of phase-separating and plus-end-directed kinesin domains), which achieved 8-fold selectivity and 40% efficiency ( Reinkemeier et al., 2019 84. Reinkemeier, C.D. ∙ Girona, G.E. ∙ Lemke, E.A. Designer membraneless organelles enable codon reassignment of selected mRNAs in eukaryotes Science. 2019; 363 :eaaw2644 Crossref Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Membranes themselves can serve as scaffolds to locally concentrate tethered biomolecules owing to a reduction of dimensionality with important implications (e.g., for signaling cascades) ( Grecco et al., 2011 36. Grecco, H.E. ∙ Schmick, M. ∙ Bastiaens, P.I. Signaling from the living plasma membrane Cell. 2011; 144 :897-909 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (152) PubMed Google Scholar ). Phase separation in the cytoplasm is another means to reach very high local concentrations of biomolecules, and the relevance of phase separation at membranes, where both effects can combine, has recently become an intense field of research ( Case et al., 2019a 16. Case, L.B. ∙ Ditlev, J.A. ∙ Rosen, M.K. Regulation of Transmembrane Signaling by Phase Separation Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2019; 48 :465-494 Crossref Scopus (73) PubMed Google Scholar ). To test the relevance of the phase separation-based assemblers (FUS and EWSR1, fused to PylRS and MCP, respectively) for film-like organelle functionality, we performed additional FFC experiments for all four membrane systems, in which we compared constructs with and without FUS/EWSR1. We determined that using the phase separation-based assemblers was essential for functionality for three (OMMP, GMP, and ERMP) systems, whereas for the plasma membrane system, the performance was similar with or without FUS/EWSR1 ( Figures 3 A–3C and S1 A).
Using IF and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), we confirmed that these organelles highly enrich tRNA Pyl , PylRS, mRNA::ms2, and cellular ribosomes ( Figures 4 , S2 , and S3 ; Video S1 ). We performed super-resolution microscopy ( Rust et al., 2006 86. Rust, M.J. ∙ Bates, M. ∙ Zhuang, X. Sub-diffraction-limit imaging by stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) Nat. Methods. 2006; 3 :793-795 Crossref Scopus (5033) PubMed Google Scholar ) and detected a high degree of localization of tRNA Pyl to a very thin layer, with almost no tRNA Pyl distinguishable from background in the remainder of the cytoplasm ( Figure 4 B). Notably, for the simple line/rim shaped PMP system, the full width at half-maximum of the tRNA Pyl distribution was clearly sub-resolution (<<100 nm, see the lower left line scan in Figure 4 B). This substantiates the hypothesis that a sharp suppressor tRNA Pyl gradient can be formed using the OT film-like organelle approach, effectively creating a unique, spatially confined biochemical microenvironment. Taking into account that tRNAs are relatively small molecules, which might have been expected to rapidly diffuse on a cellular scale, this appears to be quite remarkable. These results affirm that all of the OT film-like organelles act orthogonally to the host’s translation in the cytoplasm.

IF staining against PylRS and RPL26L1 show co-localization of endogenous ribosomes with OT organelles. PylRS (magenta), RPL26L1 (cyan), NLS::EGFP 39TAG ::box (green).
We next investigated if the four OT film-like organelles meet the independent assembly criterion defined above ( Figure 1 B). To determine if the organelles mix components with each other, we designed constructs in which PylRS and MCP were individually fused to a membrane-targeting domain and to a phase separating assembler (FUS and EWSR1, respectively) ( Figures 3 D–3F). We then co-expressed each membrane directed PylRS variant, either without an MCP construct or with the MCP targeted to one of the four membranes. We assayed all 20 possible combinations for selective translation by FFC using the dual color ms2 reporter (EGFP 39TAG , mCherry 190TAG ::ms2). As expected for an OT organelle, we observed high selectivity (i.e., a more vertical distribution in the FFC plot) if MCP and PylRS were both targeted to the same membrane. In the FFC data shown in Figure 3 D, combinations of MCP and PylRS for the same membrane-targeting system sit on the diagonal across the matrix (also indicated by white stars in Figures 3 E and 3F). Whereas a number of systems showed only background expression if MCP and PylRS were targeted to the respective membranes, this was not the case for all. Background expression is defined as the expression profile detected in the absence of MCP (−MCP) ( Figures 3 D–3F, area inside the dotted red line; note the logarithmic scale of the FFC plots). Specifically, neither the combination of ERMP and PMP systems nor a combination of the OMMP system with any other yielded a vertical distribution substantially above background, indicating that no mixing of different biomolecules occurred between the different targeting destinations. Thus, we conclude that only the combination of ERMP with PMP and OMMP with ERMP/PMP/GMP fulfilled the independent assembly criterion (see Figures S4 B–S4D for corresponding imaging).
Our experimental observations are consistent with what is known about each membrane biogenesis pathway. Because mitochondrial membranes are not directly coupled to the exocytic or endocytic machinery ( Bonifacino and Glick, 2004 12. Bonifacino, J.S. ∙ Glick, B.S. The mechanisms of vesicle budding and fusion Cell. 2004; 116 :153-166 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1206) PubMed Google Scholar ), the OMMP system is also more orthogonal to all the others than the GMP system ( Figures 3 D–3F). Although also more complex membrane interactions pathways exist ( Gordaliza-Alaguero et al., 2019 35. Gordaliza-Alaguero, I. ∙ Cantó, C. ∙ Zorzano, A. Metabolic implications of organelle-mitochondria communication EMBO Rep. 2019; 20 :e47928 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wu et al., 2018 102. Wu, H. ∙ Carvalho, P. ∙ Voeltz, G.K. Here, there, and everywhere: The importance of ER membrane contact sites Science. 2018; 361 :eaan5835 Crossref Scopus (215) PubMed Google Scholar ), and although designed for a different purpose, our assay might be useful in the future to readout the amount of protein exchanged between different membrane compartments in eukaryotic cells.
Next, we aimed to address the selective RNA recruitment criterion. Thus far, we had used MCP to recruit ms2-tagged mRNAs into the synthetic organelles. From the wealth of literature available on alternatives to the ms2-MCP system for RNA targeting, we chose the λ N22 peptides that selectively bind boxB loops ( Daigle and Ellenberg, 2007 22. Daigle, N. ∙ Ellenberg, J. LambdaN-GFP: an RNA reporter system for live-cell imaging Nat. Methods. 2007; 4 :633-636 Crossref Scopus (157) PubMed Google Scholar ) and are known to be orthogonal to the ms2-MCP system. To test if the boxB-λ N22 interaction can also enable selective orthogonal translation, we used another dual-color fluorescence reporter for FFC analysis, which we called the dual color boxB reporter. This reporter expresses EGFP 39TAG and mCherry 190TAG from one plasmid, but this time the mCherry mRNA is fused to four boxB loops ( Figures 2 C and 2E). Notably, using the boxB-λ N22 approach, we observed even higher selectivity for all membrane-associated OT organelles (12- to 17-fold changes) and achieved efficiencies of up to 80%, thus bettering all our OT systems reported here and previously ( Reinkemeier et al., 2019 84. Reinkemeier, C.D. ∙ Girona, G.E. ∙ Lemke, E.A. Designer membraneless organelles enable codon reassignment of selected mRNAs in eukaryotes Science. 2019; 363 :eaaw2644 Crossref Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures 2 D and 2E). These experiments demonstrated that OT organelles equipped with λ N22 peptides act also orthogonally to the host’s endogenous translation.
To confirm that these λ N22 -based OT organelles also fulfill the independent assembly criterion, we performed experiments analogous to those with individual ms2-MCP-based synthetic organelles. We tested another 20 combinations using the boxB-λ N22 targeting system ( Figures 3 E, 3F, and S1 B). Again, we determined that the combination of the ERMP and PMP systems, as well as the combination of the OMMP system with any other system, fulfill the independent assembly criterion.
We also performed IF and FISH staining to determine the composition of the λ N22 -based organelles, and again observed strong recruitment of tRNA Pyl , mRNA::boxB, and ribosomes ( Figures S4 E, S4F, and S5 ; Video S1 ).
We next verified that the boxB-λ N22 - and ms2-MCP-based organelle systems are orthogonal to each other. To that end, we co-expressed OT organelles possessing MCP or λ N22 peptides with either the dual color boxB reporter (EGFP 39TAG , mCherry 190TAG ::boxB) or the dual color ms2 reporter (EGFP 39TAG , mCherry 190TAG ::ms2). We observed selective GCE of the targeted mRNA only for the correct combinations with the corresponding RNA-recruitment domain (ms2-MCP and boxB-λ N22 , respectively) ( Figure S6 ), which demonstrates that the ms2-MCP and boxB-λ N22 systems fulfill the selective RNA recruitment criterion.
To further corroborate that the systems work selectively, we developed a doubly tagged imaging reporter in which the nucleoporin 153 (Nup153) was fused to EGFP and boxB loops, and the histone H2B was fused to mCherry and ms2 loops; both constructs contained an amber codon at a permissive site (Nup153::EGFP 149TAG ::boxB, H2B::mCherry 190TAG ::ms2). Because Nup153 is a nucleoporin of the nuclear pore complex and H2B is a histone, we would expect to observe EGFP fluorescence at the nuclear envelope and mCherry fluorescence in the nucleus. We co-expressed these two proteins with the different OT film-like organelles and analyzed cells using fluorescence microscopy. For all constructs, we observed that Nup153::EGFP 149TAG was produced only in the presence of a λ N22 -based OT organelle, whereas H2B::mCherry 190TAG was produced only in the presence of an MCP-based organelle ( Figure 2 F). Importantly, these proteins were observed at their expected subcellular localization. Note that these two constructs have also much larger mRNAs than the simple EGFP and mCherry models used in the FFC experiments above, underlining the robustness of the method.
Next, we addressed the distinct ncAA specificity criterion. Over 100 different ncAAs have been genetically encoded by PylRS ( Wan et al., 2014 95. Wan, W. ∙ Tharp, J.M. ∙ Liu, W.R. Pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase: an ordinary enzyme but an outstanding genetic code expansion tool Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2014; 1844 :1059-1070 Crossref Scopus (198) PubMed Google Scholar ). This was facilitated by the lack of affinity of the wild-type (WT) enzyme for canonical amino acids and a few mutants having substrate promiscuity for ncAAs similar in structure to pyrrolysine ( Fekner et al., 2009 28. Fekner, T. ∙ Li, X. ∙ Lee, M.M. ... A pyrrolysine analogue for protein click chemistry Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.

Biol. 2019; 26 :936-949.e13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (12) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, when aiming to encode two different ncAAs via distinct PylRS variants inside the same cell, any form of cross-affinity between substrates due to the inherent promiscuity of the PylRS would be detrimental.
In the experiments described to this point, we used PylRS AF to incorporate a bulky cyclooctyne-lysine derivative (SCO-K). Previously, we used PylRS AA (N346A, C348A) ( Wang et al., 2013 97. Wang, Y.S. ∙ Fang, X. ∙ Chen, H.Y. ... Genetic incorporation of twelve meta-substituted phenylalanine derivatives using a single pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase mutant ACS Chem. Biol. 2013; 8 :405-415 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) to encode 3-iodophenylalanine (3-IF) in OT organelles ( Reinkemeier et al., 2019 84. Reinkemeier, C.D. ∙ Girona, G.E. ∙ Lemke, E.A. Designer membraneless organelles enable codon reassignment of selected mRNAs in eukaryotes Science. 2019; 363 :eaaw2644 Crossref Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ). We now identified that these two PylRS variants have distinct ncAA specificity and that PylRS AF selectively uses SCO-K, whereas PylRS AA accepts 3-IF ( Figure S1 D).
Finally, we combined our solutions to the issues of assembly, RNA recruitment and ncAA specificity, to obtain two fully orthogonal GCE organelles inside the same cell: one λ N22 -based OT system that incorporates one type of ncAA into a selected POI with boxB-tagged mRNA, and an MCP-based OT system that incorporates a different type of ncAA into a different POI with ms2-tagged mRNA. By contrast, the canonical host machinery in the cytoplasm processes neither efficiently.
To test our systems, we developed another dual-color fluorescence reporter in which EGFP 39TAG mRNA is fused to boxB loops and mCherry 190TAG mRNA is fused to ms2 loops; we term this the “double-recruitment reporter” (EGFP 39TAG ::boxB, mCherry 190TAG ::ms2). This reporter should yield an FFC diagonal if both ncAAs (SCO-K and 3-IF) are present in the growth medium, and a horizontal (EGFP 39TAG ::boxB) or vertical (mCherry 190TAG ::ms2) population if only one ncAA is present.
Here, we focused on the most selective OT organelle systems: PMP MCP or ERMP MCP together with OMMP λN22 . To our initial surprise, although our OT organelles met the orthogonality criteria tested, none of the combinations yielded two organelles that are orthogonal to each other when expressed in one cell ( Figure S7 ). We speculated that the internal tendency of PylRS to function as a dimer was an unexpected complication. We found out that the issue can be bypassed by creating a fusion protein of two PylRS mutants (see Table S2 for design details and Figure S7 for further controls). In the following, we refer to these systems as “dimeric,” indicated by a superscript "v2" ( Figure 5 ).
Using the double-recruitment reporter (EGFP 39TAG ::boxB, mCherry 190TAG ::ms2), we evaluated the performance of the dimeric systems and observed that by using the λ N22 -based, OMM-targeted system, full-length EGFP was predominantly produced in the presence of SCO-K (EGFP/mCherry ratio of 17 for OMM-λ N22 -OT v2,AF ) ( Figures S7 F and S7G). In an analogous experiment, using the MCP-based system targeted to the PM, only mCherry was produced in the presence of 3-IF (mCherry/EGFP ratio of 17 for PM-MCP-OT v2,AA ) ( Figures S7 F and S7G).
We then tested the combined dimeric systems in one cell by co-expressing the OMM-λ N22 -OT v2,AF system together with PM-MCP-OT v2,AA . Using the double-recruitment reporter (EGFP 39TAG ::boxB, mCherry 190TAG ::ms2) for these systems, we observed that in the presence of SCO-K, specific for the OMM-targeted, λ N22 -based system, EGFP was selectively produced (EGFP/mCherry ratio of 7, normalized to a cytoplasmic GCE system). If 3-IF, specific for the PM-targeted MCP-based systems, was used, mCherry fluorescence was predominant (mCherry/EGFP ratios of 6). As expected, only if both ncAAs were present in the growth medium did we observe production of both EGFP and mCherry, corresponding to mCherry/EGFP ratios of ∼1 ( Figures 5 B, 5C, and S7 A). Similarly, we observed the expected selectivity for a combination of OMM-λ N22 -OT v2,AA and ERM-MCP-OT v2,AF .
We next performed IF stainings for the combined dimeric systems, confirming that they do not mix, and the OMM-targeted systems remained clearly separate from either the PM- or the ERM-directed dimeric OT organelles ( Figure 5 D).
To confirm that we had generated a cell in which two organelles execute distinct translational programs, we used the doubly tagged imaging reporter (Nup153::EGFP 149TAG ::boxB, H2B::mCherry 190TAG ::ms2). For all of the constructs tested, we observed that full-length Nup153::EGFP 149TAG was produced only in the presence of the ncAA specific for the λ N22 -based OT organelle, and full-length H2B::mCherry 190TAG was produced only in the presence of the ncAA specific for the MCP-based organelle. Only in the presence of both ncAAs were both proteins produced ( Figure 5 E).
To validate site-specific incorporation of the ncAAs, we purified EGFP and mCherry from HEK293T cells co-expressing the OMM-λ N22 -OT v2,AF system together with PM-MCP-OT v2,AA , the double-recruitment reporter (EGFP 39TAG ::boxB, mCherry 190TAG ::ms2) and tRNA Pyl , and performed qualitative coupled liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis of peptides resulting from tryptic digest. Here, we used the ncAA 3-IF together with the lysine derivative N -ε-benzyloxycarbonyl-lysine (Cbz-K) that is selectively only incorporated by PylRS AF , but not by PylRS AA ( Figure S1 D). Data S1 show that we can detect mCherry modified with 3-IF at position 190 and EGFP containing Cbz-K at position 39 reliably. However, MS/MS is a very sensitive technique, and even our best performing film-like organelles only show 20-fold selectivity. We thus expectedly also detected the peptides for EGFP with 3-IF and mCherry with Cbz-K.
Unfortunately, the used MS/MS approach does not allow for an easy quantification of protein abundance and thus cannot answer directly how much 3-IF and Cbz-K are respectively incorporated into EGFP and mCherry. However, the ratio of incorporated ncAAs in each protein is key to evaluate if these dual orthogonal systems are functionally independent enough to selectively modify desired proteins. We thus devised a site-specific bioorthogonal chemistry approach to probe if the two organelles selectively incorporate distinct ncAAs, which we aimed to label selectively with a small-molecule dye. To this end, we first established that we could use two pairs of ncAAs in the respective organelle, one of which can participate in a ligation with a tetrazine-fluorophore derivative whereas the other remains unreactive. Specifically, we used a combination of the established 3-IF with the axial isomer of trans -cyclooct-2-ene-lysine (TCO ∗ A-K). 3-IF is accepted by PylRS AA and TCO ∗ A-K by PylRS AF ( Figure S1 D). TCO ∗ A-K rapidly reacts with a tetrazine in a strain-promoted inverse electron-demand Diels-Alder cycloaddition ( Nikić et al., 2014 69. Nikić, I. ∙ Plass, T. ∙ Schraidt, O. ...

The nonreactive 3-IF cannot be easily detected by such an unambiguous method, and it is thus not easy to confirm that the other dimeric film-like organelle also performs as selectively as the FFC and imaging experiments described above indicate. Therefore, following established procedures ( Kurra et al., 2014 53. Kurra, Y. ∙ Odoi, K.A. ∙ Lee, Y.J. ... Two rapid catalyst-free click reactions for in vivo protein labeling of genetically encoded strained alkene/alkyne functionalities Bioconjug. Chem. 2014; 25 :1730-1738 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ), we synthesized a compound in which a cyclooctyne side chain is mounted onto a tyrosine scaffold (SCO-Y), which readily reacts with a tetrazine. Gratifyingly, SCO-Y was also recognized by PylRS AA but not by PylRS AF ( Figure S1 D). This allowed us to use a combination of the nonreactive Cbz-K and SCO-Y ( Figures 6 B and S1 D) to validate proper specificity of the PylRS AA containing organelles.
First, we combined OMM-λ N22 -OT v2,AF with PM-MCP-OT v2,AA in cells that expressed the doubly tagged imaging reporter (Nup153::EGFP 149TAG ::boxB, H2B::mCherry 190TAG ::ms2). Cells were incubated with TCO ∗ A-K and 3-IF during protein expression and then washed extensively so that only ncAA incorporated faithfully into the protein of choice can be labeled with a silicon rhodamine-tetrazine conjugate (H-Tet-SiR) ( Lukinavičius et al., 2013 61. Lukinavičius, G. ∙ Umezawa, K. ∙ Olivier, N. ... A near-infrared fluorophore for live-cell super-resolution microscopy of cellular proteins Nat. Chem. 2013; 5 :132-139 Crossref Scopus (523) PubMed Google Scholar ). Under the fluorescence microscope, we observed both Nup153::EGFP and H2B::mCherry fluorescence. Importantly, after extensive washing to remove leftover dye, the SiR fluorescence colocalized predominantly with the Nup153::EGFP signal. Because only TCO ∗ A-K, and not 3-IF, can react with H-Tet-SiR, this demonstrates that only full-length Nup153::EGFP 149 TCO∗A-K and H2B::mCherry 190 3-IF were produced ( Figure 6 C). Correspondingly, if the cells were incubated with Cbz-K and SCO-Y, the SiR fluorescence colocalized mainly with the H2B::mCherry signal. Because only SCO-Y (and not Cbz-K) can react with tetrazines, this indicates the production of full-length Nup153::EGFP 149 Cbz-K and H2B::mCherry 190 SCO-Y ( Figure 6 D).
Second, we analogously probed the selectivity of the combination of OMM-λ N22 -OT v2,AA with ERM-MCP-OT v2,AF . Accordingly, if cells were incubated with 3-IF and TCO ∗ A-K, the SiR fluorescence colocalized only with the H2B::mCherry signal, which showed that the cells produced Nup153::EGFP 149 3-IF and H2B::mCherry 190 TCO∗A-K ( Figure 6 E). Correspondingly, if Cbz-K and SCO-Y were used the SiR fluorescence was observed at the nuclear rim, colocalizing with Nup153::EGFP. Therefore, the reactive SCO-Y was mainly incorporated into Nup153::EGFP 149 SCO-Y , whereas the unreactive Cbz-K was inserted into H2B::mCherry 190 Cbz-K ( Figure 6 F).
These data demonstrate that the respective ncAAs are incorporated predominantly and very selectively into the targeted protein within the respective dimeric OT film-like organelle.

Section: Discussion

Our findings show that if we apply concepts of 2D phase separation at a cellular membrane, the interface with that membrane becomes a powerful platform for bioengineering. Using this approach, we can build multiple independent and functionally orthogonal enzymes in one cell by spatial organization. We show the feasibility of this approach for the complex process of protein translation, which requires hundreds of factors to work in concert. We apply these systems to specifically modify different proteins with different ncAAs, effectively equipping cells with two expanded genetic codes, or put another way, a second and third genetic code in the same cell. Our data appear consistent with the illustration in Figure 7 . The combination of protein condensation and membrane mounting leads to a sharp suppressor tRNA Pyl gradient. Using super-resolution microscopy, we determined a gradient with a full width at half-maximum of less the 100 nm for the line-shaped PMP system ( Figure 4 ). Furthermore, we observed that the OMMP and ERMP systems work selectively, even though a substantial portion of the cellular interior is filled with mitochondria and ER ( Figure S3 ). This body of data is direct evidence that the suppressor tRNA Pyl —despite being relatively small and not being tethered itself—can be confined remarkably well, and after it is aminoacylated with its specific ncAA, it does not leave the respective organelle before being consumed by translation. This can be viewed as a distinct biochemical microenvironment, which shows that a combination of protein condensation and membrane targeting can substantially alter biomolecular composition with very high precision. This feature enables us to simultaneously use the same suppressor tRNA Pyl in different film-like organelles, to engineer different ncAAs into different proteins. To do so, only the respective PylRS variants and mRNA-binding proteins need to be directly fused to the organelle scaffolds, whereas all other components of the translational machinery remain shared between the organelles and the host. This demonstrates the power of creating thin, sub-resolution biochemical microenvironments in cells ( Figures 5 , 6 , and 7 ). As shown in Figure S7 , it is an experimental observation that making PylRS dimer fusion constructs further enabled achieving the desired orthogonality between two different film-like organelles, and we speculate that this is because PylRS activity is dimerization dependent ( Kavran et al., 2007 49. Kavran, J.M. ∙ Gundllapalli, S. ∙ O’Donoghue, P. ... Structure of pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase, an archaeal enzyme for genetic code innovation Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Major advances in enzyme engineering have been made in recent decades. These can be broadly classified as either directed evolution ( Arnold, 2019 5. Arnold, F.H. Innovation by Evolution: Bringing New Chemistry to Life (Nobel Lecture) Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2019; 58 :14420-14426 Crossref Scopus (114) PubMed Google Scholar ) or computer-aided rational design ( Huang et al., 2016a 42. Huang, P.S. ∙ Boyken, S.E. ∙ Baker, D. The coming of age of de novo protein design Nature. 2016; 537 :320-327 Crossref Scopus (641) PubMed Google Scholar ). Directed evolution is powerful for optimizing and refining existing catalytic activities and can also be used to create enzyme functions that do not exist in nature. Computer-aided de novo protein design is particularly suitable for designing completely novel structures because it allows sampling of a vast sequence space in silico . The resulting designs are often expressed and tested in E. coli ( Cao et al., 2020 15. Cao, L. ∙ Goreshnik, I. ∙ Coventry, B. ...

Xu, C. ∙ Lu, P. ∙ Gamal El-Din, T.M. ... Computational design of transmembrane pores Nature. 2020; 585 :129-134 Crossref Scopus (6) PubMed Google Scholar ). More recently, strategies for evolving mammalian systems have emerged ( Berman et al., 2018 10. Berman, C.M. ∙ Papa, 3rd, L.J. ∙ Hendel, S.J. ... An Adaptable Platform for Directed Evolution in Human Cells J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2018; 140 :18093-18103 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ; English et al., 2019 27.

Biol. 2018; 14 :352-360 Crossref Scopus (137) PubMed Google Scholar ), although E. coli and yeast remain the preferred hosts for handling large libraries ( Almhjell et al., 2018 3. Almhjell, P.J. ∙ Boville, C.E. ∙ Arnold, F.H. Engineering enzymes for noncanonical amino acid synthesis Chem. Soc. Rev. 2018; 47 :8980-8997 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Branon et al., 2018 13.

Continuous directed evolution of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases Nat. Chem. Biol. 2017; 13 :1253-1260 Crossref Scopus (95) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our concept of diversifying and repurposing the same enzyme multiple times by means of spatial compartmentalization could even be combined with those strategies, thus extending the repertoire of enzyme functionality that can be engineered within the same eukaryotic cell.
It has long been known that cells use their membranes for internal organization and to process signaling events. By analogy, membraneless organelles are a means to organize cellular functionality ( Alberti, 2017 2. Alberti, S. The wisdom of crowds: regulating cell function through condensed states of living matter J. Cell Sci. 2017; 130 :2789-2796 Crossref Scopus (85) PubMed Google Scholar ; Banani et al., 2017 6. Banani, S.F. ∙ Lee, H.O. ∙ Hyman, A.A. ... Biomolecular condensates: organizers of cellular biochemistry Nat. Rev. Mol.

Phase separation in biology; functional organization of a higher order Cell Commun. Signal. 2016; 14 :1 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Only more recently has the combination of the two come into focus. Membrane-associated phase separation is inherently a two-dimensional process ( Banjade and Rosen, 2014 7. Banjade, S. ∙ Rosen, M.K. Phase transitions of multivalent proteins can promote clustering of membrane receptors eLife. 2014; 3 :e04123 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Li et al., 2012 59. Li, P. ∙ Banjade, S. ∙ Cheng, H.C. ... Phase transitions in the assembly of multivalent signalling proteins Nature. 2012; 483 :336-340 Crossref Scopus (995) PubMed Google Scholar ). The distinct localization of membrane-associated phase separation primes it to be involved in cellular signaling, and indeed, two-dimensional condensates are important in T cell receptor signaling ( Ditlev et al., 2019 24. Ditlev, J.A. ∙ Vega, A.R. ∙ Köster, D.V. ...

Phase separation of signaling molecules promotes T cell receptor signal transduction Science. 2016; 352 :595-599 Crossref Scopus (416) PubMed Google Scholar ), in the postsynaptic densities of neurons ( Zeng et al., 2018 108. Zeng, M. ∙ Chen, X. ∙ Guan, D. ... Reconstituted Postsynaptic Density as a Molecular Platform for Understanding Synapse Formation and Plasticity Cell. 2018; 174 :1172-1187.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (116) PubMed Google Scholar ), and in nephrin signaling ( Case et al., 2019b 17. Case, L.B. ∙ Zhang, X. ∙ Ditlev, J.A. ... Stoichiometry controls activity of phase-separated clusters of actin signaling proteins Science. 2019; 363 :1093-1097 Crossref Scopus (124) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kim et al., 2019 50. Kim, S. ∙ Kalappurakkal, J.M. ∙ Mayor, S. ... Phosphorylation of nephrin induces phase separated domains that move through actomyosin contraction Mol. Biol. Cell. 2019; 30 :2996-3012 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ). Both membrane binding and phase separation at membranes concentrate biomolecules and these are not mutually exclusive events. However, in this study, phase separation was essential in three out of four cases ( Figures 3 and S1 A). One explanation for the OT organelles on the plasma membrane to work similarly with or without additional protein condensation might be that the shell-like geometry of the plasma membrane already offers a sufficiently large spatial separation from the rest of the cell for OT organelles to function. The patchy appearance of the organelles we observed in Video S1 is in line with a role of membrane associated protein condensation.
Our work expands the utility of thin-film condensates by equipping them with the capability to perform orthogonal protein translation. We show that we can change the language of protein synthesis over a distance of a few tens of nanometers by forming thin translational microenvironments ( Figure 7 ), moving the near-membrane space (below 100 nm) into focus as a signaling and engineering environment. A translational program, in which one codon is reassigned to a specific ncAA is typically described as an expanded genetic code. Because we do this twice, one can argue that we obtained a eukaryotic cell with one canonical genetic code and two expanded genetic codes. Furthermore, in an OT system, all that is needed to reprogram opal or ochre stop codons instead of the amber codon requires changing the codon in the POI and the anticodon in the suppressor tRNA Pyl ( Reinkemeier et al., 2019 84. Reinkemeier, C.D. ∙ Girona, G.E. ∙ Lemke, E.A. Designer membraneless organelles enable codon reassignment of selected mRNAs in eukaryotes Science. 2019; 363 :eaaw2644 Crossref Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ).
It is tempting to speculate that nature might select membrane-associated phase separation if the biochemical microenvironment resulting from either phase separation or membrane binding alone is insufficient to achieve the level of specificity required for a certain process. Hence, these insights might have implications for understanding how the complexity of living matter arose and how compartmentalization in membrane-associated condensates could facilitate diverging evolution.
The proof-of-concept experiments described here were performed as transient transfections in HEK293T cells under GCE conditions. Thus, we cannot definitively exclude a long-term influence of the synthetic organelles on the normal physiology of the cell, and we cannot assess whether the organelle represents a heavier burden on the cell than GCE. This warrants further investigation. However, morphological changes were not apparent in stainings against various cellular structures (i.e., plasma membrane, Golgi, ER, and mitochondria), and we did not observe major alterations in cell growth compared to HEK293T cells transfected with the cytoplasmic PylRS system. Furthermore, cells that expressed the OT film-like organelles still performed protein translation.
Using LC-MS/MS, we were able to identify the correctly inserted ncAAs. In line with what is expected from a system with finite selectivity, and due to the sensitivity of MS/MS also the other two possible ncAA modified peptides were detectable. However, our MS/MS approach did not allow us to quantify how much of each ncAA was incorporated in each protein. To evaluate this, we performed bioorthogonal labeling experiments (see Figure 6 ) that highlight that the desired ncAA is predominantly incorporated by each organelle.

All plasmids can be obtained via an EMBL or JGU materials transfer agreement (free of charge for noncommercial purposes).
HEK293T cells (ATCC CRL-3216) were maintained in DMEM (Life Technologies 41965-039) supplemented with 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Sigma P0781), 1% L-Glutamine (Sigma G7513), 1% sodium pyruvate (Life Technologies 11360), and 10% FBS (Sigma F7524). Cells were cultured at 37°C in a 5% CO 2 atmosphere and passaged every 2-3 days up to 20 passages. To this end, cells were typically washed with PBS, detached using trypsin-EDTA (0.05%, with phenol red, ThermoFisher) and resuspended in fresh culture medium.
In all cases, cells were seeded 15-20 h prior to transfection at a density resulting in 70%–80% confluency at the time of transfection. Flow cytometry was performed using 24-well plates with plastic bottom (Nunclon Delta Surface, ThermoFisher). Immunofluorescence labeling and FISH were performed on 24-well plates with glass bottom (Greiner Bio-One), four-well chambered Lab-Teks #1.0 borosilicate coverglass (ThermoFisher), four-well cell imaging coverglasses (Eppendorf), glass bottom 4 well μ-slides (ibidi) or eight-well chambered Lab-Teks #1.0 borosilicate coverglass (Thermo Fisher). EGFP and mCherry immunoprecipitation (IP) experiments were performed using 100 mm or 150 mm round cell culture dishes (CELLSTAR, Greiner Bio-One).
Table S1 provides an overview of all plasmids used in this study.
Table S2 provides an overview of the sequences of all final film-like organelle constructs.
Table S3 provides an overview over all dual color reporters used in this study.
The dual color reporters were cloned in a pBI-CMV1 vector (Clontech 631630). The dual color ms2 reporter (EGFP 39TAG , mCherry 190TAG ::ms2) was described before ( Reinkemeier et al., 2019 84. Reinkemeier, C.D. ∙ Girona, G.E. ∙ Lemke, E.A. Designer membraneless organelles enable codon reassignment of selected mRNAs in eukaryotes Science. 2019; 363 :eaaw2644 Crossref Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ). The dual color boxB reporter (EGFP 39TAG , mCherry 190TAG ::boxB) was constructed by replacing the ms2 loops in the dual color ms2 reporter with four boxB loops via restriction cloning ( Daigle and Ellenberg, 2007 22. Daigle, N. ∙ Ellenberg, J. LambdaN-GFP: an RNA reporter system for live-cell imaging Nat. Methods. 2007; 4 :633-636 Crossref Scopus (157) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To clone the double-recruitment reporter (EGFP 39TAG ::boxB, mCherry 190TAG ::ms2) one multiple cloning site (MCS) of pBI-CMV1 was tagged with four boxB loops and the other with two ms2 loops. Subsequently, mCherry 190TAG and EGFP 39TAG were inserted into the MCSs. For imaging experiments similar double tagged pBIs were used, in which only the EGFP 39TAG gene was inserted into the ms2 or boxB loops tagged MCS. EGFP 39TAG or mCherry 190TAG were used as N-terminal fusions with nuclear localization sequences (NLS).
Analogously, to clone the doubly tagged imaging reporter (Nup153::EGFP 149TAG ::boxB, H2B::mCherry 190TAG ::ms2), also Nup153::EGFP 149TAG was inserted into one MCS via restriction cloning, while H2B::mCherry 190TAG was inserted into the other via Gibson assembly ( Gibson et al., 2009 33. Gibson, D.G. ∙ Young, L. ∙ Chuang, R.-Y. ... Enzymatic assembly of DNA molecules up to several hundred kilobases Nat. Methods. 2009; 6 :343-345 Crossref Scopus (4542) PubMed Google Scholar ). The template for H2B was a kind gift from the Ellenberg laboratory.
The iRFP::EGFP 39TAG construct used in Figure S1 D was published before ( Nikić et al., 2016 71. Nikić, I. ∙ Estrada Girona, G. ∙ Kang, J.H. ... Debugging Eukaryotic Genetic Code Expansion for Site-Specific Click-PAINT Super-Resolution Microscopy Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2016; 55 :16172-16176 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ).
tRNA Pyl was cloned under the control of a human U6 promoter, and all other constructs were under CMV promoters cloned in a pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen V86020) as described previously ( Reinkemeier et al., 2019 84. Reinkemeier, C.D. ∙ Girona, G.E. ∙ Lemke, E.A. Designer membraneless organelles enable codon reassignment of selected mRNAs in eukaryotes Science. 2019; 363 :eaaw2644 Crossref Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ). The template for the 4xλ N22 peptides was a kind gift from the Ellenberg laboratory ( Daigle and Ellenberg, 2007 22. Daigle, N. ∙ Ellenberg, J. LambdaN-GFP: an RNA reporter system for live-cell imaging Nat. Methods. 2007; 4 :633-636 Crossref Scopus (157) PubMed Google Scholar ). They were generally used with an N-terminally fused c-Myc tag (EQKLISEEDL), MCP constructs were fused to an HA-tag (YPYDVPDYA) unless otherwise indicated.
The MCP protein was cloned from the addgene plasmid #31230 ( Grünwald and Singer, 2010 37. Grünwald, D. ∙ Singer, R.H. In vivo imaging of labelled endogenous β-actin mRNA during nucleocytoplasmic transport Nature. 2010; 467 :604-607 Crossref Scopus (220) PubMed Google Scholar ), FUS from the addgene plasmid #26374 and EWSR1 from the addgene plasmid #26377 ( Hoell et al., 2011 40. Hoell, J.I. ∙ Larsson, E. ∙ Runge, S. ... RNA targets of wild-type and mutant FET family proteins Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2011; 18 :1428-1431 Crossref Scopus (230) PubMed Google Scholar ). In all FUS fusions, amino acids 1-478 were used, in all EWSR1 fusions, amino acids 1-628. In all PylRS fusions the previously reported efficient NES::PylRS AF (Y306A, Y384F) was used ( Nikić et al., 2016 71. Nikić, I. ∙ Estrada Girona, G. ∙ Kang, J.H. ... Debugging Eukaryotic Genetic Code Expansion for Site-Specific Click-PAINT Super-Resolution Microscopy Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2016; 55 :16172-16176 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Alternatively, when specifically indicated NES::PylRS AA (N346A, C348A) was used.
The murine LCK 1-10 sequence (MGCVCSSNPE) ( Zlatkine et al., 1997 111. Zlatkine, P. ∙ Mehul, B. ∙ Magee, A.I.

Designer membraneless organelles enable codon reassignment of selected mRNAs in eukaryotes Science. 2019; 363 :eaaw2644 Crossref Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar )].

Transfections of HEK293T cells were performed using 3 μg PEI (Sigma-Aldrich 408727) per 1 μg DNA diluted in DMEM without Phenol Red (GIBCO11880-028), [1200 ng total DNA in 50 μL medium for 24-well plates and for the ms2 FISH experiment in four-well imaging cover glasses (Eppendorf); 1680 ng DNA in 70 μL medium for four-well cell imaging cover glasses (Eppendorf), or 4 well μ-slides (ibidi); 600 ng in 25 μL medium for eight-well chambered Lab-Teks (ThermoFisher); 47.1 μg DNA in 1 mL medium for 100 mm round cell culture dishes; 141.3 μg DNA in 3 mL medium for 150 mm round cell culture dishes (Greiner Bio-One)].
For amber suppression system tests, cells were transfected at a ratio of a 1:1:1:1 with POI TAG vectors, tRNA Pyl , and OT organelle plasmids (a mock plasmid was used to adjust the total plasmid amount to be constant). 4-6 hours after transfection the medium was exchanged to fresh one containing ncAA supplemented with 25 mM HEPES (pH = 7.25). Cells were analyzed one day after transfection.
For dual organelle FFC experiments such as e.g., in Figures 5 and S7 , cells were transfected at a ratio of 4:4:1:3 with the double-recruitment reporter (EGFP 39TAG ::boxB, mCherry 190TAG ::ms2), tRNA Pyl , bicistronic OT organelle vector and a mock plasmid. Alternatively, they were transfected at a ratio of 4:4:1:1:2 with the double-recruitment reporter (EGFP 39TAG ::boxB, mCherry 190TAG ::ms2), tRNA Pyl , and two individual OT organelle vectors and a mock plasmid.
For dual organelle imaging experiments such as e.g., in Figure 5 , cells were transfected at a ratio of 1:1:1 with the doubly tagged imaging reporter (Nup153::EGFP 149TAG ::boxB, H2B::mCherry 190TAG ::ms2), tRNA Pyl and a bicistronic OT organelle vector.
For bioorthogonal labeling experiments such as e.g., in Figure 6 , cells were transfected at a ratio of 4:4:1:3 with the doubly tagged imaging reporter (Nup153::EGFP 149TAG ::boxB, H2B::mCherry 190TAG ::ms2), tRNA Pyl , a bicistronic OT organelle vector and a mock plasmid.

Stock solutions for all the used ncAAs were prepared as described in previous work ( Nikić et al., 2015 70. Nikić, I. ∙ Kang, J.H. ∙ Girona, G.E. ... Labeling proteins on live mammalian cells using click chemistry Nat. Protoc. 2015; 10 :780-791 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar ). SCO-K (cyclooctyne lysine, SiChem SC-8000) was used at a final concentration of 250 μM; 3-iodophenylalanine (Chem-Impex International Inc., 14352) was used at a final concentration of 1 mM, TCO ∗ A-K (trans-cyclooct-2-ene-lysine, SiChem SC-8004) was used at a final concentration of 250 μM for FFC experiments and 20 μM for imaging experiments; Cbz-K (N-ε-benzyloxycarbonyl-lysine, Sigma 96840) was used at a final concentration of 250 μM; SCO-Y (cyclooctyne tyrosine, see chemical synthesis section for further details) was used at a final concentration of 250 μM. SCO-K, TCO ∗ A-K and Cbz-K are efficiently recognized by PylRS AF (Y306A, Y384F) while 3-IF and SCO-Y are recognized by PylRS AA (C346A, N348A).
Transfections for flow cytometry were performed with four plasmids (reporter plasmid, tRNA Pyl , the wanted version of synthetase and an MCP fusion or a mock plasmid) at a 1:1:1:1 ratio with 1.2 μg total DNA. Medium was exchanged for fresh medium (supplemented with 25 mM HEPES, pH = 7.25) containing the ncAA, 4-6 h post-transfection and left until the time of harvesting. HEK293T cells were harvested 1 day after transfection by removing the medium, resuspending the cells in PBS and passing them through 100 μm nylon mesh.
Data acquisition was performed in an LSRFortessa SORP Cell Analyzer (BD). Analysis was done using the FlowJo software (FlowJo). Cells were first gated by cell type (using FSC-A x SSC-A parameters) and then by single cell (SSC-A x SSC-W). The workflow of cell gating is exemplarily shown in Figure S1 C. Lastly, fluorescence was acquired in the 488-530/30 channel for EGFP signal, in the 561-610/20 channel for mCherry signal and in the 640-730/45 channel for the iRFP signal. Bar plots and heatmaps were generated using Prism software (GraphPad).
In the FFC analysis we adjust the PMT settings to get the signal as diagonal as possible, while spanning 5 orders of magnitude. However, at lower fluorescence values for the cytoplasmic PylRS/tRNA Pyl system we observe a slight straight vertical rise, which then goes over into a diagonal. This could be due to several different factors, such as transcription rates, detector sensitivities, PMT amplifications and offset settings, transfection-based factors, different FP folding rates etc. Most likely, the substantially higher brightness of EGFP compared to mCherry contributes to this effect. However, this result is highly reproducible for a given setting and we performed each experiment at least in three biological replicates and analyze in each case a few hundred thousand cells. For all quantitative measurements we further normalize the fluorescence values of each system to a cytoplasmic PylRS control, which was included in each experiment.
IF experiments were performed one day after transfection. Cells were rinsed with PBS, fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature (RT) for 10 minutes and rinsed with PBS. Subsequently, cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton-x-100 solution in PBS for 15 minutes at RT and rinsed twice prior to blocking.

Finally, cells were rinsed with PBS and fresh PBS was added for imaging.
If only DNA was stained, cells were fixed and permeabilized as described above and subsequently stained with Hoechst 33342 (Sigma-Aldrich B2261) at 1 mg/mL in PBS or with DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich D9542) at 1 mg/mL in PBS for 10 min at RT. Then, cells were rinsed with PBS and fresh PBS was added for imaging.

Debugging Eukaryotic Genetic Code Expansion for Site-Specific Click-PAINT Super-Resolution Microscopy Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2016; 55 :16172-16176 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, the hybridization protocol was adapted from Pierce et al. ( Pierce et al., 2014 78. Pierce, J.B. ∙ Chafe, S.C. ∙ Eswara, M.B.K. ... Strategies for investigating nuclear-cytoplasmic tRNA dynamics in yeast and mammalian cells Methods Cell Biol. 2014; 122 :415-436 Crossref Scopus (2) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 60 minutes at RT, rinsed with PBS and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton-x-100 solution in PBS for 15 minutes at RT. Then cells were rinsed with PBS and 2xSSC (0.3 M NaCl, 30 mM sodium citrate (pH = 7.4), 50% formamide) and incubated with the hybridization buffer (0.6 M NaCl, 60 mM sodium citrate (pH = 7.4), 100 μg/μL dextran sulfate (Sigma-Aldrich, D8906), 198 ng/μL BSA, 2 mM VRC (ribonucleoside vanadyl complexes, Sigma-Aldrich, 94740), 80 ng/μL E. coli tRNA (Sigma-Aldrich R1753), 50% formamide, and the respective hybridization probe) at 37°C overnight.

For bioorthogonal labeling experiments eight-well chambered Lab-Teks were coated with poly-L-lysine solution (10 μg/mL poly-L-lysine hydrobromide, Sigma-Aldrich, in water) overnight at room temperature (RT). Then, the wells were rinsed twice with PBS and cells were seeded, transfected and incubated with ncAAs overnight as described above. Subsequently, they were washed 5 times over 2 hours with fresh medium (supplemented with 25 mM HEPES, pH = 7.25). Then they were washed with DMEM without phenol red and subsequently labeled with 0.2 or 1 μM H-Tet-SiR (Spirochrome, SC008) ( Lukinavičius et al., 2013 61.

Subsequently, cells were washed 6-8 times with fresh medium (supplemented with 25 mM HEPES, pH = 7.25) over 4 hours. Then, they were rinsed with PBS, fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS at RT for 10 minutes and finally rinsed 3x with PBS.
Confocal images were acquired on an Olympus Fluoroview FV3000 microscope using 405 nm (Alexa405), 488 nm (EGFP), 594 nm (mCherry) and 640 nm (for Alexa 647, Cy5) lasers for excitation with a 60x/1.40 oil immersion objective.

3D reconstructions were made using the arivis Vision4D software (arivis AG). Videos of each reconstruction were exported from arivis Vision4D and subsequently assembled and annotated using Adobe Premiere Pro 2020 software.
EGFP and mCherry IP experiments were performed one day after transfection. Cells were washed with PBS, detached using trypsin-EDTA (0.05%, with phenol red, ThermoFisher) and resuspended in medium. Then cells were transferred to a 50 mL tube and centrifuged for 20 minutes at 500 xg, 20°C. The supernatant was discarded, and cells were resuspended in 1 mL of PBS and transferred to a 1.5 mL tube, then they were pelleted for 5 minutes at 500 xg, 4°C and subsequently rinsed with 500 μL PBS and then pelleted for 10 minutes at 500 xg, 4°C. Subsequently, the supernatant was discarded, and cells were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −20°C until further processing.
For lysis, cells were thawed and resuspended in 200 μL RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1.0% Triton-x-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mM Tris, pH = 8.0) supplemented with cOmplete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche, 11873580001). They were incubated on ice for 20 minutes (with pipetting every 10 minutes) and subsequently sonicated at 4°C (20x 30 s on/ 30 s off, using a Bioruptor Plus sonication device, Diagenode in “HIGH” mode). Then samples were centrifuged for 30 minutes at > 20000 xg, 4°C and then EGFP and mCherry were purified using GFP-Trap Magnetic Agarose/RFP-Trap Magnetic Agarose beads (ChromoTek, gtma-20/rtma-20) according to manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, 25 μL slurry of both GFP- and RFP-Trap beads were added to 500 μL dilution buffer (10 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA), magnetically separated and washed twice with dilution buffer. Then the clarified lysate was diluted with 300 μL dilution buffer and bound to the beads for one hour at 4°C (on a rolling shaker). Then the beads were magnetically separated, the supernatant was removed and beads were washed three times with dilution buffer. Subsequently, proteins were eluted using acidic elution buffer [200 mM glycine (pH 2.5)] and the eluate was neutralized by adding 1 M Tris (pH 10.4), (for 50 μL elution buffer 5 μL 1 M Tris were added). Then protein loading dye was added [used at a 1:5 ratio, 312.5 mM Tris, 10% SDS, 25% glycerol, 5 mM beta-mercaptoethanol, 0.05% bromophenol blue (pH 6.8)] samples were boiled at 95°C for approximately 5 minutes and subsequently separated via SDS-PAGE [NuPAGE 4%–12% Bis-Tris-Gel run in NuPAGE MOPS SDS Running Buffer (ThermoFisher)]. Subsequently, gels were stained with Coomassie [80 mg/mL Coomassie brilliant Blue G250 (Fluka), 3 mM HCl].
Coomassie-stained bands were excised, chopped into small pieces, and transferred to 0.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes. For all following steps, buffers were exchanged by two consecutive 15 minutes incubation steps of the gel pieces with 200 μL of acetonitrile (MeCN) whereby the MeCN was removed after each step. Proteins were reduced by the addition of 200 μL of a 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) solution in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate (AmBiC, Sigma Aldrich, A6141) and incubation at 56°C for 30 minutes. Proteins were alkylated by the addition of 200 μL of a 55 mM chloroacetamide (CAA) solution in 100 mM AmBiC and incubation for 20 minutes in the dark. A 0.1 μg/μL stock solution of trypsin (Promega, V511A) in trypsin resuspension buffer (Promega, V542A) was diluted with ice-cold 50 mM AmBiC buffer to achieve a final concentration of 1 ng/μL. 50 μL thereof were added to gel pieces, which were incubated first for 30 minutes on ice and then over night at 37°C. Gel pieces were sonicated for 15 minutes, spun down and the supernatant was transferred into a glass vial (VDS Optilab, 93908556). Remaining gel pieces were washed with 50 μL of an aqueous solution of 50% MeCN and 1% formic acid and sonicated for 15 minutes. The combined supernatants were dried in a SpeedVac and reconstituted in 10 μL of an aqueous solution of 0.1% (v/v) formic acid.
Peptides were analyzed by LC-MS/MS on an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher). To this end, peptides were separated using an Ultimate 3000 nano RSLC system (Dionex) equipped with a trapping cartridge (Precolumn C18 PepMap100, 5 mm, 300 μm i.d., 5 μm, 100 Å) and an analytical column (Acclaim PepMap 100. 75 × 50 cm C18, 3 mm, 100 Å) connected to a Nanospray Flex ion source (ThermoFisher). For the detection of modified peptides, peptides were loaded onto the trap column at 30 μL per minute using solvent A (0.1% formic acid) and peptides were eluted using a gradient from 2 to 80% Solvent B (0.1% formic acid in MeCN) over 60 minutes at 0.3 μL per minute (all solvents were of LC-MS grade). The Orbitrap Fusion Lumos was operated in positive ion mode with a spray voltage of 2.4 kV and capillary temperature of 275°C. Full scan MS spectra with a mass range of 375–1200 m/z were acquired in profile mode using a resolution of 120,000 (maximum injections time of 50 ms, the automatic gain control (AGC) target value was set to standard with a max injection time of 50 ms. Precursors were isolated using the quadrupole with a window of 1.2 m/z and fragmentation was triggered by high-energy C-trap dissociation (HCD) in fixed collision energy mode with fixed collision energy of 34%. MS/MS spectra were acquired with the Orbitrap with a resolution of 15.000 and a max injection time of 54 ms.
Acquired data were analyzed using IsobarQuant ( Franken et al., 2015 29. Franken, H. ∙ Mathieson, T. ∙ Childs, D. ... Thermal proteome profiling for unbiased identification of direct and indirect drug targets using multiplexed quantitative mass spectrometry Nat. Protoc. 2015; 10 :1567-1593 Crossref Scopus (215) PubMed Google Scholar ) and Mascot V2.4 (Matrix Science) using a reverse UniProt FASTA database from Homo sapiens (UP000005640) including common contaminants as well as protein sequences of the protein of interest. Incorporation of noncanonical amino acids were considered as variable modifications of lysine (EGFP 39K or mCherry 190K ) or phenylalanine (EGFP 39F or mCherry 190F ) with Cbz-K or 3-IF respectively (see Table S4 for the respective protein sequences). In addition, the following modifications were considered: Carbamidomethyl (C, fixed), acetyl (K, variable), acetyl (Protein N terminus, variable), oxidation (M, variable). The mass error tolerance for full scan MS spectra was set to 10 ppm and to 0.02 Da for MS/MS spectra. A maximum of 2 missed cleavages were allowed. A minimum of 2 unique peptides with a peptide length of at least seven amino acids and a false discovery rate below 0.01 were required on the peptide and protein level ( Savitski et al., 2015 87.
