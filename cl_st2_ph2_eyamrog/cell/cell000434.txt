Title: Metabolic modeling of single Th17 cells reveals regulators of autoimmunity


Abstract: Summary

Metabolism is a major regulator of immune cell function, but it remains difficult to study the metabolic status of individual cells. Here, we present Compass, an algorithm to characterize cellular metabolic states based on single-cell RNA sequencing and flux balance analysis. We applied Compass to associate metabolic states with T helper 17 (Th17) functional variability (pathogenic potential) and recovered a metabolic switch between glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation, akin to known Th17/regulatory T cell (Treg) differences, which we validated by metabolic assays. Compass also predicted that Th17 pathogenicity was associated with arginine and downstream polyamine metabolism. Indeed, polyamine-related enzyme expression was enhanced in pathogenic Th17 and suppressed in Treg cells. Chemical and genetic perturbation of polyamine metabolism inhibited Th17 cytokines, promoted Foxp3 expression, and remodeled the transcriptome and epigenome of Th17 cells toward a Treg-like state. In vivo perturbations of the polyamine pathway altered the phenotype of encephalitogenic T cells and attenuated tissue inflammation in CNS autoimmunity.

Section: Introduction

Cellular metabolism regulates normal cell functions as well as the pathophysiology of multiple disease conditions. Recently, the study of metabolism in immune cells (immunometabolism) emerged as an active field of research and revealed metabolic regulation of inflammation in almost all contexts, including anti-viral immunity, autoimmunity, and anti-tumor response ( Buck et al., 2017 15.

Due to the scale and complexity of the metabolic network, a metabolic perturbation can create cascading effects and alter a seemingly distant part of the network or cut across traditional pathway definitions. Therefore, computational tools are needed to contextualize observations on specific reactions or enzymes into a systems-level understanding of metabolism and its dysregulation in disease. One successful framework is flux balance analysis (FBA), which translates curated knowledge on the network’s topology and stoichiometry into mathematical objects used for in silico predictions on metabolic fluxes ( Lewis et al., 2012 62. Lewis, N.E. ∙ Nagarajan, H. ∙ Palsson, B.O. Constraining the metabolic genotype-phenotype relationship using a phylogeny of in silico methods Nat. Rev.

Systems Biology: Constraint-Based Reconstruction and Analysis Cambridge University Press, 2015 Crossref Google Scholar ). FBA methods proved particularly useful when contextualized with functional genomic data ( Bordbar et al., 2014 11. Bordbar, A. ∙ Monk, J.M. ∙ King, Z.A. ... Constraint-based models predict metabolic and associated cellular functions Nat. Rev. Genet. 2014; 15 :107-120 Crossref Scopus (454) PubMed Google Scholar ), usually gene expression of bulk cell populations. The advent of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) now offers an opportunity to harness FBA to study the metabolic heterogeneity of single cells.
We and others have studied transcriptional and functional diversity among T helper 17 (Th17) cells ( Gaublomme et al., 2015 34. Gaublomme, J.T. ∙ Yosef, N. ∙ Lee, Y. ...

Th17 and Treg cells share lineage signals, and their balance shapes the outcome of tissue inflammation ( Eisenstein and Williams, 2009 30. Eisenstein, E.M. ∙ Williams, C.B.

Although transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) alone induces Foxp3 + Tregs in vitro , a combination of TGF-β1 and interleukin (IL)-6 induce Th17 cells in vitro and in vivo ( Bettelli et al., 2006 8.

On top of the Th17/Treg balance, there exists functional diversity within the Th17 compartment. Th17 cells may induce disease but they also protect mucosal tissues by promoting tissue homeostasis, maintaining barrier function, and restraining opportunistic microbiota ( Bettelli et al., 2008 9.

Murine Th17 cells induced by TGF-β1+IL-6 in vitro produce IL-17 but are incapable of inducing potent tissue inflammation upon adoptive transfer ( Jäger et al., 2009 47.

The interleukin 23 receptor is essential for the terminal differentiation of interleukin 17-producing effector T helper cells in vivo Nat. Immunol. 2009; 10 :314-324 Crossref Scopus (712) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, there appear to be at least two different types of Th17 cells: homeostatic ones that do not promote tissue inflammation, to which we refer as non-pathogenic Th17 cells and ones that produce IL-17 together with interferon (IFN)g and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and induce tissue inflammation/autoimmunity, to which we refer as pathogenic Th17 cells ( Lee et al., 2014 59. Lee, Y. ∙ Collins, M. ∙ Kuchroo, V.K. Unexpected targets and triggers of autoimmunity J. Clin. Immunol. 2014; 34 :S56-S60 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Distinct types of Th17 cells have also been identified in humans, where cells similar to mouse pathogenic Th17 cells are specific for immune response to Candida albicans, whereas cells similar to the non-pathogenic mouse Th17 are observed with Staphylococcus aureus infection ( Zielinski et al., 2012 114. Zielinski, C.E. ∙ Mele, F. ∙ Aschenbrenner, D. ... Pathogen-induced human TH17 cells produce IFN-γ or IL-10 and are regulated by IL-1β Nature. 2012; 484 :514-518 Crossref Scopus (609) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, Treg, non-pathogenic Th17, and pathogenic Th17 cells represent a functional spectrum in tissue homeostasis, infection, and tissue inflammation in vivo and can be differentiated with different cytokine cocktails in vitro .
Metabolism is an established regulator of the Th17/Treg axis ( Barbi et al., 2013 4. Barbi, J. ∙ Pardoll, D. ∙ Pan, F. Metabolic control of the Treg/Th17 axis Immunol. Rev. 2013; 252 :52-77 Crossref Scopus (135) PubMed Google Scholar ). We hypothesized that metabolism similarly regulated the effector functions of Th17 subtypes. However, most cellular assays, including metabolic assays, are targeted and difficult to undertake at a single-cell resolution. Furthermore, low cell numbers may prohibit direct metabolic assays, for example, in the study of immune cells present at tissue sites. In contrast, scRNA-seq is broadly accessible and rapidly collected in concentrated efforts to reach a complete representation of human physiology ( Regev et al., 2017 90. Regev, A. ∙ Teichmann, S.A. ∙ Lander, E.S. ..., Human Cell Atlas Meeting Participants The Human Cell Atlas eLife. 2017; 6 :e27041 Crossref Scopus (591) PubMed Google Scholar ). A computational method is thus required to capitalize on the opportunities afforded by scRNA-seq for contextualization of metabolic models, while systematically addressing the unique challenges of this data modality (e.g., its sparsity).
Here, we present Compass, an FBA algorithm that uses single-cell transcriptomic profiles to characterize cellular metabolic states at single-cell resolution and with network-wide comprehensiveness. Compass allows detection of targets across the entire metabolic network, agnostically of pre-defined metabolic pathway boundaries, and including ancillary pathways that are normally less studied yet important for cellular function ( Puleston et al., 2017 88. Puleston, D.J. ∙ Villa, M. ∙ Pearce, E.L. Ancillary Activity: Beyond Core Metabolism in Immune Cells Cell Metab. 2017; 26 :131-141 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ). We applied the algorithm to Th17 cells, uncovering substantial immunometabolic diversity associated with their inflammatory effector functions. In addition to differential wiring of central carbon metabolism, this analysis identified the polyamine pathway as a critical regulator of Th17 effector function, which we experimentally validated.

Section: Results

We reasoned that even though the mRNA expression of enzymes is not an accurate proxy for their metabolic activity, a global analysis of the metabolic network (as enabled by RNA-seq) in the context of a large sample set (as offered by single-cell genomics) coupled with strict criteria for hypotheses testing, would provide an effective framework for predicting cellular metabolic states. This led us to develop the Compass algorithm, which integrates scRNA-seq profiles with prior knowledge of the metabolic network to infer metabolic states of cells ( Figure 1 A).
The metabolic network is encoded in a genome-scale metabolic model (GSMM) that includes reaction stoichiometry, biochemical constraints such as reaction irreversibility, nutrient availability, and gene-enzyme-reaction associations. Here, we use Recon2, which is comprised of 7,440 reactions and 2,626 unique metabolites ( Thiele et al., 2013 103. Thiele, I. ∙ Swainston, N. ∙ Fleming, R.M.T. ... A community-driven global reconstruction of human metabolism Nat. Biotechnol. 2013; 31 :419-425 Crossref Scopus (651) PubMed Google Scholar ). To explore the metabolic capabilities of each cell, Compass solves a series of constraint-based optimization problems (formalized as linear programs) that produce a set of numeric scores, one per reaction ( STAR Methods ). Intuitively, the score of each reaction in each cell reflects how well-adjusted is the cell’s overall transcriptome to maintaining high flux through that reaction. Henceforth, we refer to the scores as quantifying the “potential activity” of a metabolic reaction (or “activity” in short when it is clear from the context that Compass predictions are discussed).
Compass belongs to the family of FBA algorithms that model metabolic fluxes (the rate by which chemical reactions convert substrates to products), through constrained-based optimization ( Palsson, 2015 84. Palsson, B.Ø. Systems Biology: Constraint-Based Reconstruction and Analysis Cambridge University Press, 2015 Crossref Google Scholar ). The first step of Compass is agnostic to gene expression and computes, for every metabolic reaction r , the maximal flux 𝑣 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑡 𝑟 it can carry while imposing only stoichiometry and mass balance constraints. Next, Compass assigns every reaction in every cell a penalty inversely proportional to the mRNA expression associated with the enzyme(s) catalyzing the reaction in that cell. Finally, for every reaction r and every cell, Compass finds a flux distribution (an assignment of flux values to every reaction in the network) that minimizes the overall penalty incurred, while maintaining a flux of at least 𝜔 ⋅ 𝑣 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑡 𝑟 (here, ω = 0.95) through r . The additive inverse of this penalty term is the reaction score.
The use of genome-scale metabolic networks allows the entire metabolic transcriptome to impact the computed score for any particular reaction, rather than just the mRNA coding for the enzymes that catalyze it. We reasoned that this helps reduce the effect of instances where mRNA expression does not correlate with metabolic activity and of scRNA-seq dropouts ( Wagner et al., 2016 108. Wagner, A. ∙ Regev, A. ∙ Yosef, N. Revealing the vectors of cellular identity with single-cell genomics Nat. Biotechnol. 2016; 34 :1145-1160 Crossref Scopus (258) PubMed Google Scholar ). Compass further mitigates data sparsity effects through information-sharing on a k -nearest neighbors graph, similar to other scRNA-seq algorithms ( Baran et al., 2019 3.

The output of Compass is a quantitative profile for the metabolic state of every cell, which is then subject to downstream analyses ( Figure 1 C). The statistical power afforded by the large number of individual cells in a typical scRNA-seq study adds robustness and allows these downstream analyses to gain biological insight despite the high dimension of the metabolic space in which Compass embeds cells.
We used Compass to study the metabolism of Th17 cells differentiated in vitro into two extreme functional states ( Figure 2 A)—pathogenic (Th17p) and non-pathogenic (Th17n). We analyzed a dataset we generated in a previous study that included 139 Th17p and 151 Th17n cells sorted for IL-17A/GFP + ( Gaublomme et al., 2015 34. Gaublomme, J.T. ∙ Yosef, N. ∙ Lee, Y. ...

Wang, C. ∙ Yosef, N. ∙ Gaublomme, J. ... CD5L/AIM Regulates Lipid Biosynthesis and Restrains Th17 Cell Pathogenicity Cell. 2015; 163 :1413-1427 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (175) PubMed Google Scholar ). We computed Compass scores and aggregated reactions that were highly correlated across the entire dataset (Spearman’s rho ≥0.98) into meta-reactions (median of two reactions per meta-reaction) ( Figure S1 A) for downstream analysis. We tested the robustness of Compass by running the algorithm on the same gene expression input with added random noise. The deviation of the noised Compass scores from the original output did not exceed the deviation induced by the noise to the gene expression input ( Figures S1 B–S1C).
To investigate the main determinants of metabolic heterogeneity between Th17 cells, we first analyzed the Compass output as a high dimensional representation of the cells that parallels the one produced by scRNA-seq but with features corresponding to metabolic meta-reaction rather than genes. We performed principal component analysis (PCA) on the meta-reaction matrix, while restricting it to 784 meta-reactions (out of 1,911) that are associated with core metabolism ( STAR Methods ), spanning conserved and well-studied pathways for generation of ATP and synthesis of key biomolecules.
The first two principal components (PCs) were associated with overall metabolic activity and T effector functions ( Figures 2 B, S2 A, and S2B; Table S1 ). PC1 correlated with the cell’s total metabolic activity, defined as the expression ratio of genes coding metabolic enzymes out of the total protein coding genes (Pearson’s rho = 0.36, p < 4e−10), as well as a transcriptional signature of late stages of Th17 differentiation over time ( Yosef et al., 2013 112. Yosef, N. ∙ Shalek, A.K. ∙ Gaublomme, J.T. ... Dynamic regulatory network controlling TH17 cell differentiation Nature. 2013; 496 :461-468 Crossref Scopus (434) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S2 C) (Pearson’s rho = 0.18, p < 0.003) ( STAR Methods ). PC2 and PC3 represented a choice between ATP generation through aerobic glycolysis versus fatty acid oxidation, similar to previous observations in comparisons of Th17 to Tregs, or Teff to Tmem ( Geltink et al., 2018 35. Geltink, R.I.K. ∙ Kyle, R.L. ∙ Pearce, E.L. Unraveling the Complex Interplay Between T Cell Metabolism and Function Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2018; 36 :461-488 Crossref Scopus (185) PubMed Google Scholar ). Accordingly, these PCs correlated with multiple Th17 pathogenicity markers, as well as a signature of Th17 pathogenicity consisting of cytokines, chemokines, and transcription factors (TFs) that are associated with each phenotypic group ( Lee et al., 2012 58. Lee, Y. ∙ Awasthi, A. ∙ Yosef, N. ... Induction and molecular signature of pathogenic TH17 cells Nat. Immunol. 2012; 13 :991-999 Crossref Scopus (652) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures S2 D and S2E). PC2 and PC3 were also associated with nitrogen metabolism and were enriched in urea cycle targets whose power to modulate Th17 pathogenicity is demonstrated below.
To detect metabolic targets associated with the pathogenic capacity of individual Th17 cells, we defined pro-pathogenic and pro-regulatory reactions as ones that were significantly differentially active in Th17p or Th17n, respectively ( Figures 2 C and S2 F; Table S2 ; STAR Methods ) (1,213/6,563 reactions, Benjamini-Hochberg [BH] adjusted Wilcoxon rank-sum p < 0.001). Many of these reactions were also correlated with the expression of cytokines and TFs relevant for Th17 function ( Figures 2 D and S2 G; Table S3 ) (note that these genes do not code metabolic enzymes and thus were not used by Compass). Notably, many classically defined metabolic pathways included both reactions predicted to be pro-pathogenic and pro-regulatory ( Figure 2 E), highlighting the value in examining single reactions within a global network rather than conducting a pathway-level analysis. A similar result is obtained at the gene expression level—many metabolic pathways included both genes that were upregulated and genes that were downregulated in Th17p compared to Th17n ( Figure S2 H).
Compass highlighted differences in central carbon metabolism between the Th17p and Th17n states, which mirror those found between Th17 and Treg. The algorithm predicted that glycolytic reactions were generally more active in Th17p than in Th17n ( Figures 2 C and 3 A). This parallels previous results showing that Th17 upregulate glycolysis, and failure to do so promotes a Treg fate ( Gerriets et al., 2015 36. Gerriets, V.A. ∙ Kishton, R.J. ∙ Nichols, A.G. ...

Compass also predicted an increased activity in Th17p through two segments of the TCA cycle, but not the cycle as a whole ( Figures 2 C and 3 A). A similar breakdown of the TCA cycle in relation with pro-inflammatory function has been described in macrophages where M1 polarization divided the TCA cycle at the same two points: isocitrate dehydrogenase ( Jha et al., 2015 49.

In fatty acid (FA) metabolism, Compass predicted that cytosolic acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC1), the committed step toward FA synthesis, was upregulated in Th17p, whereas the first two steps of long-chain FA oxidation (long chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetase and carnitine O-palmitoyltransferase [CPT]) were predicted to be higher in Th17n. These predictions mirror a known metabolic difference between the Th17 and Treg lineages, where Th17 rely on de novo FA synthesis ( Berod et al., 2014 7. Berod, L. ∙ Friedrich, C. ∙ Nandan, A. ... De novo fatty acid synthesis controls the fate between regulatory T and T helper 17 cells Nat. Med. 2014; 20 :1327-1333 Crossref Scopus (374) PubMed Google Scholar ), whereas Tregs scavenge them from their environment and catabolize them and produce ATP through beta-oxidation ( Michalek et al., 2011 73. Michalek, R.D. ∙ Gerriets, V.A. ∙ Jacobs, S.R. ... Cutting edge: distinct glycolytic and lipid oxidative metabolic programs are essential for effector and regulatory CD4+ T cell subsets J.

Oleic acid restores suppressive defects in tissue-resident FOXP3 Tregs from patients with multiple sclerosis J. Clin. Invest. 2021; 131 :e138519 Crossref Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ). We note, however, that recent evidence suggests that CPT may be upregulated in Treg over Th17 but is not functionally indispensable for Treg to obtain their effector phenotypes ( Raud et al., 2018 89. Raud, B. ∙ Roy, D.G. ∙ Divakaruni, A.S. ... Etomoxir Actions on Regulatory and Memory T Cells Are Independent of Cpt1a-Mediated Fatty Acid Oxidation Cell Metab. 2018; 28 :504-515.e7 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (117) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Multiple amino-acid metabolism reactions were also differentially active between Th17p and Th17n ( Figure 2 C; Table S2 ). Amino acids are important for Th17 cell differentiation ( Sundrud et al., 2009 102. Sundrud, M.S. ∙ Koralov, S.B. ∙ Feuerer, M. ... Halofuginone inhibits TH17 cell differentiation by activating the amino acid starvation response Science. 2009; 324 :1334-1338 Crossref Scopus (275) PubMed Google Scholar ), and Compass adds further granularity to these findings. In particular, it predicted that serine biosynthesis from 3-phosphoglycerate and three downstream serine fates—sphingosines, choline, and S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM)—were higher in Th17p. On the other hand, parts of urea cycle and arginine metabolism are significantly associated with both Th17 states, ( Figure 2 C), suggesting that alternative fluxing within this subsystem may be associated with diverging Th17 cell function.
We validated the Compass prediction that Th17p and Th17n differ in their central carbon metabolism ( Figure 3 A). First, we assayed glycolysis and mitochondrial function of Th17 cells ( Figure 3 B). Th17p had higher extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) than Th17n, indicating accumulation of lactate due to aerobic glycolysis. Th17p also generated more ATP in a mitochondria-dependent fashion, consistent with the predicted higher entrance of pyruvate into the TCA cycle despite the diversion of some pyruvate toward the lactate fate.
Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) metabolomics indicated that glycolytic metabolites were higher in Th17p than in Th17n ( Figure 3 C, top). When further pulsed with fresh media containing glucose for 15 min, there was a substantial increase in glycolytic metabolites in Th17p but less so in Th17n. After 3 h, the level of these metabolites decreased back to steady state ( Figure S3 A). TCA metabolites, apart from succinate, were more abundant at steady state in Th17p than in Th17n ( Figure 3 C, middle), consistent with Compass prediction that two parts of the TCA cycle, but not the cycle as a whole, were upregulated in Th17p. Therefore, both Compass and the metabolomics data point to succinate as a potential metabolic control point.
To test whether not only absolute metabolite levels, but also the relative allocation of carbon into alternative fates, differ between Th17p and Th17n, we performed carbon tracing with 13 C-glucose. Consistent with our predictions, Th17p had higher relative abundance of 13 C-labeled glycolytic metabolites ( Figure 3 D). Furthermore, Th17p preferentially incorporated glucose-derived carbon into serine (that branches from glycolysis) ( Figure S3 B) and its downstream product choline ( Figure 3 D), confirming a Compass prediction ( Figure 2 C). Conversely, Th17p had lower relative abundance of 13 C-labeled TCA metabolites ( Figure 3 D), suggesting that the higher level of TCA intermediates observed in Th17p at steady state ( Figure 3 C) might not be supported from glucose, but rather from other sources ( Johnson et al., 2018 50. Johnson, M.O. ∙ Wolf, M.M. ∙ Madden, M.Z. ... Distinct Regulation of Th17 and Th1 Cell Differentiation by Glutaminase-Dependent Metabolism Cell. 2018; 175 :1780-1795.e19 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (159) PubMed Google Scholar ; Pucino et al., 2019 87. Pucino, V. ∙ Certo, M. ∙ Bulusu, V. ...

Taken together, our results suggest that Th17p cells have higher overall activity through the TCA cycle at steady state but quickly switch to aerobic glycolysis when glucose is readily available in the environment.
We next validated the prediction that Th17n cells prefer beta-oxidation. Metabolomics analysis shows that Th17n were enriched in acyl-carnitine metabolites, particularly short- to medium-length acyl groups ( Figures 3 C and S3 A), indicating active lipid transport through the mitochondrial membrane. When etomoxir was used to block acyl-carnitine transportation, oxygen consumption rate decreased in Th17n but not Th17p ( Figure 3 E). Although etomoxir has off-target effects ( Divakaruni et al., 2018 29. Divakaruni, A.S. ∙ Hsieh, W.Y. ∙ Minarrieta, L. ... Etomoxir Inhibits Macrophage Polarization by Disrupting CoA Homeostasis Cell Metab. 2018; 28 :490-503.e7 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (106) PubMed Google Scholar ; Raud et al., 2018 89.

Etomoxir Actions on Regulatory and Memory T Cells Are Independent of Cpt1a-Mediated Fatty Acid Oxidation Cell Metab. 2018; 28 :504-515.e7 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (117) PubMed Google Scholar ), overall our data support the hypothesis that Th17n cells ultimately divert fatty acid breakdown products into the electron transport chain to generate ATP.
The polyamine pathway stood out as one of the most significantly associated with differences in Th17 pathogenicity according to Compass predictions ( Figure 4 A; Table S2 ). We constructed a data-driven metabolic network anchored around putrescine, the starting metabolite in canonical polyamine synthesis, by including adjacent metabolites whose reactions are predicted to be associated with pathogenicity ( Figure 4 B). Although several polyamine-associated genes were differentially expressed between Th17p and Th17n, the network tied the differential polyamine metabolism to differences in upstream and downstream metabolic reactions that could not be captured from differential gene expression directly. Specifically, Compass predicted that Th17n cells are more active in arginine metabolic pathways, upstream of putrescine, and in alternative fates of putrescine (other than conversion to spermidine along the canonical polyamine synthesis pathway).
We asked whether critical enzymes of the polyamine pathway ( Figure 4 C) were differentially expressed between CD4 + T cell subsets using qPCR. Ornithine decarboxylase 1 (ODC1) and spermidine/spermine N1 acetyltransferase 1 (SAT1) are the rate-limiting enzymes of polyamine biosynthesis and catabolic processes, respectively. SAT1 level was higher in Th17p than in Th17n or Treg, whereas ODC1 was similarly expressed in Th17n and Th17p but significantly lower in Treg. Interestingly, argininosuccinate synthetase 1 (ASS1), an enzyme upstream of polyamine biosynthesis was upregulated in Th17n, consistent with Compass-predicted alternative flux in the polyamine neighborhood ( Figure 4 D). Collectively, these data suggest that the polyamine pathway may be associated with functional state in Th17 and other T cell lineages.
We next measured polyamine metabolites using an enzymatic assay and LC/MS metabolomics ( STAR Methods ). Compared to Th17p, Treg and Th17n had reduced levels of total polyamines ( Figure 4 E), reflecting reduced import, reduced biosynthesis, or increased export of polyamines in these cells. We then measured metabolites in the polyamine neighborhood ( Figures 4 F and S4 A). Consistent with Compass’s predictions, there was higher creatine content in Th17n than in Th17p. Although cellular ornithine (polyamine precursor) was comparable between Th17p and Th17n, Th17p had higher levels of putrescine and acetyl-putrescine ( Figure 4 F). Of note, cellular spermidine and acetyl-spermidine were not different between the conditions, and spermine was not detected ( Figure 4 F). The reduced putrescine and its acetyl form in Th17n are unlikely due to increased export, because we observed very little polyamines in the media of either Th17n or Th17p ( Figure S4 A). These data suggest that polyamines accumulate within Th17p and that the main function of SAT1 in Th17p may be to recycle rather than to export polyamines.
Arginine and citrulline can be used to synthesize the polyamine precursor ornithine. We used carbon- or hydrogen-labeled arginine or citrulline to study polyamine biosynthesis ( Figures S4 B and S4C). We harvested cells and media for LC/MS at 0, 1, 5, and 24 h post addition of labeled arginine. Although labeled cellular guanidinoacetic acid, a byproduct of arginine conversion into ornithine, was comparable between Th17n and Th17p, over time Th17p cells accumulated more intracellular putrescine, acetyl-putrescine, and acetyl-spermidine ( Figure S4 B), consistent with increased polyamine biosynthesis and/or recycling activity in these cells. Conversely, Th17n accumulated more labeled arginine than Th17p. This prompted us to investigate whether Th17n can also better synthesize (as opposed to better uptake) arginine, which would be consistent with higher ASS1 expression ( Figure 4 D) in these cells. We pulsed cells with labeled citrulline, an arginine precursor, and indeed observed higher levels of labeled arginine in Th17n ( Figure S4 C). Collectively, the targeted metabolomics and tracing data suggest that Th17n accumulate arginine, and Th17p preferentially synthesize or recycle polyamines. We conclude that differences in polyamine biosynthesis are associated with the different Th17 functional states.
We studied the effects of polyamine pathway inhibitors on Th17 differentiation in vitro . Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), an irreversible inhibitor of ODC1, suppressed polyamines and inhibited IL-17 expression in both Th17n and Th17p ( Figures 5 A, 5B, and S5 A). DFMO also inhibited the expression of other canonical Th17 cytokines such as IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21, and IL-22, while promoting IL-9 levels in culture supernatant ( Figure 5 C). IL-17 inhibition does not appear to be solely related to IL-2 regulation ( Bowlin et al., 1987 12. Bowlin, T.L. ∙ McKown, B.J. ∙ Sunkara, P.S. The effect of alpha-difluoromethylornithine, an inhibitor of polyamine biosynthesis, on mitogen-induced interleukin 2 production Immunopharmacology. 1987; 13 :143-147 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ), because DFMO promoted IL-2 expression in Th17p, but not Th17n ( Figure 5 C). In support of this view, IL-2 neutralization did not rescue the inhibitory effects of DFMO ( Figures S5 B–S5E). DFMO reduced cell proliferation (data not shown) and this likely contributed to its suppression of Th17 effector functions. However, when considering only cells that had divided exactly once as means to select cells that are equally potent proliferators, DFMO treatment led to a lower frequency of IL-17 + cells (data not shown). Therefore, DFMO can regulate Th17 also independently of proliferation. The increased secretion of IL-9 (a Th9 cytokine) by DFMO-treated cells also suggests that DFMO does not inhibit Th17 function solely by reducing cell viability.
Turning to Th17 transcription factors, DFMO suppressed Rorgt and Tbet expression in Th17p but not Th17n ( Figure 5 D), suggesting a nuanced effect. Consistently, DFMO decreased pStat3, and not total Stat3 protein levels, only in Th17p ( Figure S5 F). IL-17 inhibition is not due to increased Foxo1 activity, another critical regulator of Th17 function, because DFMO promoted pFoxo1(S256) ( Figure S5 F). Given the reciprocal regulation of Th17 and Treg, and because DMFO also impacted polyamine levels in Tregs ( Figure S5 A), we asked whether DFMO regulates Foxp3 even under Th17 differentiation conditions. DFMO increased the frequency of Foxp3 + cells in Th17n but not Th17p ( Figure 5 E), presumably because TGF-β1 is required for Foxp3 expression.
To determine whether other enzymes of the polyamine pathway also regulate Th17 function, we used inhibitors of spermine synthase (SRM) and spermidine synthase (SMS) ( Figure 5 A). Similar to DFMO, inhibitors of any of the biosynthesis enzymes suppressed IL-17 and promoted IL-9 and Foxp3 expression, the latter in Th17n ( Figure 5 F). Furthermore, using diminazene aceturate to inhibit SAT1, a rate-limiting enzyme of polyamine acetylation and recycling, had similar effects ( Figure 5 F). SAT1 and ODC1 are probably part of a self-regulating feedback loop, because perturbation in one was previously reported to affect the other ( Jell et al., 2007 48. Jell, J. ∙ Merali, S. ∙ Hensen, M.L. ... Genetically altered expression of spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase affects fat metabolism in mice via acetyl-CoA J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282 :8404-8413 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar ; Mounce et al., 2016 78. Mounce, B.C. ∙ Poirier, E.Z. ∙ Passoni, G. ... Interferon-Induced Spermidine-Spermine Acetyltransferase and Polyamine Depletion Restrict Zika and Chikungunya Viruses Cell Host Microbe. 2016; 20 :167-177 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ; Pegg, 2008 85. Pegg, A.E. Spermidine/spermine-N(1)-acetyltransferase: a key metabolic regulator Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2008; 294 :E995-E1010 Crossref Scopus (207) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistent with this finding, inhibition of ODC1 with DFMO suppressed SAT1 expression in Th17 cells ( Figure S5 G).
Finally, we confirmed that the effect of DFMO was through inhibition of ODC1, as addition of putrescine to cells treated with DFMO completely reversed their phenotype ( Figure 5 G). Interestingly, addition of putrescine with SAT1 inhibition partially reversed the upregulation of Foxp3, but not the suppression of IL-17 ( Figure 5 H). This suggests that ODC1 and SAT1 have not only shared but also (despite their proximity in the metabolic network) distinct functions in the regulation of the T effector program.
To further confirm the effects of polyamine pathway inhibition on T cells, we differentiated Th17 cells from wild-type (WT) and ODC1 −/− mice. Similar to DFMO treatment, there was complete inhibition of Th17 canonical cytokines, such as IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-22, but not IFNg, in ODC1 −/− Th17 cells ( Figures 5 I and S5 H). Although ODC1 deficiency did not lead to a decrease in Rorgt expression (data not shown), the loss of Th17 canonical cytokines is consistent with loss of the Th17 program. Furthermore, ODC1 −/− Th17n upregulated Foxp3, consistent with promotion of a Treg program ( Figure 5 I). Finally, the observed effects of ODC1 −/− were rescued by addition of putrescine ( Figures 5 I and S5 H).
To gain mechanistic insight, we profiled bulk RNA from Th17p, Th17n, and iTreg cells treated with DFMO or control ( STAR Methods ). DFMO had a profound impact on the transcriptome of all three lineages, driving Th17 cells toward a Treg profile ( Figure 6 A). We next determined the aggregate effect of DFMO on genes that are upregulated (n = 1,284), downregulated (n = 1,255), or comparable (n = 8,257) in untreated Th17 versus Treg ( Figure 6 B). In both Th17p and Th17n, DFMO suppressed the Th17-specific in favor of the Treg-specific transcriptome ( Figure 6 C; Tables S4 and S5 ). Canonical Th17 cell genes such as IL17a, IL17f, and IL23r were suppressed, whereas Treg-related genes, such as Foxp3 and CCL3, were upregulated ( Figure 6 B). There was no consistent effect of DFMO on Treg or genes expressed comparably in Th17 and Treg ( Figure 6 C). Thus, the polyamine pathway is important for restricting the Treg-like program in Th17 cells in both Th17p and Th17n states.
DFMO also promoted a subset of genes that are characteristic to Th17n but not to Th17p or iTreg ( Figure S6 A; Table S6 ). Notably, DFMO treatment in both Th17n and Th17p led to elevated levels of the pro-regulatory IL-9 transcript ( Lee et al., 2012 58. Lee, Y. ∙ Awasthi, A. ∙ Yosef, N. ... Induction and molecular signature of pathogenic TH17 cells Nat. Immunol. 2012; 13 :991-999 Crossref Scopus (652) PubMed Google Scholar ), consistent with the aforementioned protein analysis ( Figure 5 C) and the initial Compass prediction ( Figure 2 D). This accords with polyamine metabolism promoting Th17 over Treg fate on the one hand, while being associated with a Th17n fate (marked by high IL-9 expression) over Th17p on the other. Furthermore, DFMO-treated Th17 upregulated the CD5L/AIM transcript, which we showed to be predominantly expressed by Th17n ( Wang et al., 2015 109. Wang, C. ∙ Yosef, N. ∙ Gaublomme, J. ... CD5L/AIM Regulates Lipid Biosynthesis and Restrains Th17 Cell Pathogenicity Cell. 2015; 163 :1413-1427 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (175) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Although DFMO profoundly altered the Th17 transcriptome, it did not consistently restrict phosphorylation of key Th17 cell regulators, particularly not in Th17n ( Figure S5 F). We hypothesized that polyamines may impact the epigenome, which was also suggested by the altered expression of many chromatin modifiers in DFMO-treated cells ( Figure S6 B). To test this hypothesis, we measured chromatin accessibility by ATAC-seq in Th17n and iTreg cells ( STAR Methods ). Overall, DFMO treatment resulted in considerable changes in accessible regions in both lineages ( Figure S6 C). We asked whether DFMO preferentially altered accessibility in Th17- and Treg-specific regions by partitioning all accessible peaks into those more accessible (n = 10,431), less accessible (n = 3,421), or comparably accessible (n = 34,591) in untreated Th17n versus Treg ( Figure 6 D). Consistent with the RNA-seq data, DFMO restricted accessibility in Th17-specific regions and favored accessibility in Treg-specific regions ( Figure 6 D; Tables S5 and S7 ). Differentially accessible regions were found near loci encoding key effector molecules ( Table S7 ). For instance, DFMO restricted peaks in the promoter and intergenic regions of IL17a-IL17f that correspond to Rorgt binding sites known to regulate IL-17 expression ( Figure 6 E) (based on a chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing [ChIP-seq] of Th17 cells by Xiao et al. [2014 110. Xiao, S. ∙ Yosef, N. ∙ Yang, J. ... Small-molecule RORγt antagonists inhibit T helper 17 cell transcriptional network by divergent mechanisms Immunity. 2014; 40 :477-489 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (180) PubMed Google Scholar ]). Thus, DFMO can shape chromatin accessibility in favor of a Treg epigenomic landscape, and this may contribute to the emergence of a Treg-like transcriptional program in DFMO-treated Th17 cells.
To investigate which TFs may be responsible for the suppression of the Th17-specific program and upregulation of the Treg program, we looked for putative binding sites overlapping with regions whose accessibility is modulated by DFMO. When considering genomic regions that are typically more accessible in Tregs compared to Th17 and may be modulated by DFMO ( Figures 6 F and S6 D; Table S7 ), we found that in Th17n cells, DFMO increased chromatin accessibility near potential binding sites of JMJD3 along with a number of POU-domain containing TFs.
Because JMJD3 regulates T cell plasticity ( Ciofani et al., 2012 21. Ciofani, M. ∙ Madar, A. ∙ Galan, C. ... A validated regulatory network for Th17 cell specification Cell. 2012; 151 :289-303 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (670) PubMed Google Scholar ; Li et al., 2014 63. Li, Q. ∙ Zou, J. ∙ Wang, M. ... Critical role of histone demethylase Jmjd3 in the regulation of CD4+ T-cell differentiation Nat. Commun. 2014; 5 :5780 Crossref Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ; Liu et al., 2015 64. Liu, Z. ∙ Cao, W. ∙ Xu, L. ... The histone H3 lysine-27 demethylase Jmjd3 plays a critical role in specific regulation of Th17 cell differentiation J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2015; 7 :505-516 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ), we tested whether the transcriptional shifts induced by DFMO were altered in JMJD3 fl/fl CD4 cre T cells. JMJD3 deficiency reduced Foxp3 expression and abrogated the upregulation of Foxp3 and IL-10 by DFMO in Th17n ( Figure 6 G). On the other hand, both JMJD3 deficiency and ODC1 inhibition suppressed GM-CSF expression in Th17p ( Figure 6 G). Of note, DFMO did not alter JMJD3 expression in Th17 cells (data not shown). These data suggest that JMJD3 and ODC1 have both distinct and overlapping functions. Consistent with the flow cytometry data, JMJD3 deficiency in Th17n resulted in a global transcriptome-wide shift restricting the Treg and (to a lesser extent) promoting the Th17 program ( Figure 6 H; Table S5 ). This agrees with previous findings that JMJD3 ablation in vivo promoted intestinal Th17 differentiation ( Li et al., 2014 63. Li, Q. ∙ Zou, J. ∙ Wang, M. ... Critical role of histone demethylase Jmjd3 in the regulation of CD4+ T-cell differentiation Nat. Commun. 2014; 5 :5780 Crossref Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ). Notably, ODC1 inhibition by DFMO abolished the suppression of the Treg program by JMJD3 deficiency (differences between solid and dotted curves in Figures 6 H and S6 E; Table S5 ). However, the milder transcriptomic shift toward the Th17 program in JMJD3 fl/fl CD4 cre mice was not reversed with further ODC1 inhibition by DFMO. In the other direction, JMJD3 had little global impact on the effects of DFMO ( Figure S6 F). We conclude that JMJD3 requires uninhibited ODC1 activity to sustain the Treg program, whereas the promotion of the Th17 program and the suppression of the Treg program by ODC1 activity do not require JMJD3.
We investigated the polyamine pathway in vivo in the context of EAE, a CNS autoimmune disease, via two approaches: chemical inhibition of ODC1 and T cell-specific genetic deletion of SAT1 ( Figure 7 ). Because targeting multiple nodes in the polyamine pathway upregulated Foxp3 during Th17 differentiation in vitro ( Figures 5 and 6 ), we hypothesized that perturbing rate-limiting enzymes in vivo would regulate the induction of EAE.
We first tested ODC1 inhibition by adding DFMO to the drinking water of mice immunized with MOG/CFA for EAE induction. DFMO delayed the onset and severity of EAE ( Figure 7 B), and reduced antigen-specific recall responses as measured by T cell proliferation in the draining lymph node (dLN) ( Figure 7 C). Further analysis of T cells isolated from the CNS showed no difference in cytokine production but increased frequency of Foxp3 + CD4 + T cells ( Figure 7 D and data not shown). These results agree with polyamine biosynthesis regulating the Th17/Treg balance in favor of Th17 and consequently, the induction of autoimmune CNS inflammation.
Because administration of DFMO via drinking water could affect multiple cell types, we also genetically deleted SAT1 in CD4 + T cells (SAT1 fl/fl CD4 cre ). We confirmed that genetic SAT1 deficiency in Th17 abrogated polyamine acetylation ( Figure 7 E). Notably, loss of SAT1 also reduced (non-acetylated) putrescine levels, supporting a feedback mechanism as discussed above ( Figure S5 G).
We observed delayed onset and severity of EAE in SAT1 fl/fl CD4 cre mice ( Figure 7 F), as well as inhibition of antigen-specific recall responses ( Figure 7 G), similar to the effects observed with DFMO treatment. Although cytokine production was unaltered ex vivo by SAT1 deficiency, there was a trend toward decreased antigen-dependent IFNg, IL-17, and TNF production, and increased IL-9 ( Figure 7 H and S7 A). Foxp3 + CD4 + T cells were increased with a concomitant decrease of Rorgt + CD4 + T cells isolated from the CNS of SAT1 fl/fl CD4 cre mice ( Figure 7 I). Notably, the frequencies of Foxp3 + or Rorgt + cells were not different in dLN ( Figure S7 B), suggesting that the effect of SAT1 on T cells may be amplified in tissue recall responses. In conclusion, we demonstrated using both chemical and genetic perturbations at multiple levels that the polyamine pathway is an important mediator of autoimmune inflammation.

Section: Discussion

We presented Compass, an FBA algorithm, to study metabolism in single-cell transcriptomic data and validated a number of its predictions by molecular and functional analyses. These results support the power of transcriptomic-based FBA to make valid predictions in a mammalian system. The network-wide approach enabled Compass to successfully predict metabolic targets in both central and ancillary pathways.
Static FBA assumes that the system under consideration operates in chemical steady state ( Varma and Palsson, 1994 106. Varma, A. ∙ Palsson, B.O. Metabolic Flux Balancing: Basic Concepts, Scientific and Practical Use Nat. Biotechnol. 1994; 12 :994-998 Crossref Google Scholar ). Even under this assumption, there remain an infinite number of feasible flux distributions that satisfy the preset biochemical constraints. Therefore, most studies assume that cells aim to optimize some metabolic function, usually biomass production ( Damiani et al., 2019 26. Damiani, C. ∙ Maspero, D. ∙ Di Filippo, M. ... Integration of single-cell RNA-seq data into population models to characterize cancer metabolism PLoS Comput. Biol. 2019; 15 :e1006733 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, although biomass maximization may successfully predict phenotypes in unicellular organisms ( Lewis et al., 2010 61. Lewis, N.E. ∙ Hixson, K.K. ∙ Conrad, T.M. ... Omic data from evolved E. coli are consistent with computed optimal growth from genome-scale models Mol. Syst. Biol. 2010; 6 :390 Crossref Scopus (348) PubMed Google Scholar ), it is ill-suited for studying mammalian cells ( Adler et al., 2019 1. Adler, M. ∙ Korem Kohanim, Y. ∙ Tendler, A. ... Continuum of Gene-Expression Profiles Provides Spatial Division of Labor within a Differentiated Cell Type Cell Syst. 2019; 8 :43-52.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ). To overcome this challenge, rather than optimizing a single metabolic objective, Compass optimizes a set of objective functions, each estimating the degree to which a cell’s transcriptome supports carrying the maximal theoretical flux through a given reaction. The result is a high dimensional representation of the cell’s metabolic potential (one coordinate per reaction). A biological signal (e.g., differential reaction activity) can be detected despite the high-dimension owing to the statistical power afforded by the large number of cells in a typical scRNA-seq dataset. Nonetheless, there is no inherent limitation preventing one from applying Compass to study bulk (i.e., non-single-cell) transcriptomic data.
Compass correctly predicted the role of aerobic glycolysis in the induction of pathogenic Th17 and the role of beta-oxidation in the induction of pro-regulatory Th17, mirroring previous findings in comparisons of Th17 to Treg. Compass also predicted novel metabolic targets that were associated with Th17 pathogenicity, one of which was the polyamine pathway. We investigated the metabolic circuitry centered around the polyamine pathway, and demonstrated its critical role in promoting pathogenicity and restricting a Treg-like program in Th17 cells. Because of reciprocal generation of Th17/Treg cells, the effects observed with the inhibition of polyamine pathway may be unique to diseases where Th17 cells are the effector cells. The significance of the polyamine pathway in autoimmunity contexts is further supported by anecdotal data that polyamine levels are increased in several autoimmune diseases ( Hsu et al., 1994 45. Hsu, H.C. ∙ Seibold, J.R. ∙ Thomas, T.J. Regulation of ornithine decarboxylase in the kidney of autoimmune mice with the lpr gene Autoimmunity. 1994; 19 :253-264 Crossref Scopus (5) PubMed Google Scholar ; Karouzakis et al., 2012 53. Karouzakis, E. ∙ Gay, R.E. ∙ Gay, S. ... Increased recycling of polyamines is associated with global DNA hypomethylation in rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts Arthritis Rheum. 2012; 64 :1809-1817 Crossref Scopus (71) PubMed Google Scholar ) and it is thought that aberrant polyamine metabolism contributes to autoantigen stabilization ( Brooks, 2013 14. Brooks, W.H. Increased polyamines alter chromatin and stabilize autoantigens in autoimmune diseases Front. Immunol. 2013; 4 :91 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, we present a mechanism through which the polyamine pathway can regulate epigenome and thereby Th17/Treg balance and impact development of autoimmunity. We showed that DFMO, which inhibits a key step of polyamine synthesis, substantially alters the Th17 effector profile. Because DFMO is a well-tolerated, Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug ( Casero et al., 2018 17. Casero, Jr., R.A. ∙ Murray Stewart, T. ∙ Pegg, A.E. Polyamine metabolism and cancer: treatments, challenges and opportunities Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2018; 18 :681-695 Crossref Scopus (158) PubMed Google Scholar ), there might be grounds for drug repurposing of DFMO for use in immune disorders.
Compass is subject to the limitations of static FBA. The Recon2 metabolic network is incomplete (e.g., lacks annotation of enzyme moonlighting functions) and pertains to a generalized human cell. Consequently, the current version of Compass does not consider the differences between human and mouse metabolism or tissue-specificity of the metabolic network. The algorithm makes the simplifying assumption of metabolic steady state and heuristically aggregates expression of multiple genes that are linked to a reaction. The inference of metabolic programs based on transcriptomes does not consider post-transcriptional and post-translational regulation, which could be particularly important for metabolic adaptations on short timescales. Last, the metabolic state of a cell depends on the nutrients available in its environment, which are often poorly characterized. Here, our computations assume an environment rich with nutrients, which accords with the studied in vitro growth media. A more accurate representation of the cellular environment should increase the algorithm's predictive capabilities.
Concerning polyamine metabolism, chemical inhibitions of several target enzymes led to similar effects on Th17 cells, but genetic deletions of ODC1 and SAT1 did not produce identical results. Although both ODC1 and SAT1 deletion promoted Foxp3 expression, ODC1, but not SAT1, suppressed Th17 cytokines in vitro ( Figure 5 I and data not shown). Further studies are necessary to understand the mechanistic roles and reciprocal regulation between the enzymes of the polyamine pathway in vivo .

Naive CD4+CD44-CD62L+CD25-T cells were sorted using BD FACSAria sorter and activated with plate-bound anti-CD3 (1μg/ml) and anti-CD28 antibodies (1μg/ml) in the presence of cytokines at a concentration of 0.5 10 6 cells/ml. For T cell differentiations the following combinations of cytokines were used: pathogenic Th17: 25ng/ml rmIL-6, 20ng/ml rmIL-1b (both Miltenyi Biotec) and 20ng/ml rmIL-23 (RD systems); non-pathogenic Th17: 25ng/ml rmIL-6 and 2ng/ml of rhTGFb1 (Miltenyi Biotec); iTreg: 2ng/ml of rhTGFb1; Th1: 20ng/ml rmIL-12 (RD systems); Th2: 20ng/ml rmIL-4 (Miltenyi Biotec). For differentiation experiments, cells were harvested at 68 hours for RNA analysis or ATAC-Seq and 72-96h for flow cytometry analysis and Seahorse assay.
C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). WT 2D2 transgenic mice were bred in house. SAT1flox mice were kindly provided by Dr. Manoocher Soleimani (University of Cincinnati), which we crossed to CD4 cre to generate conditional T cell deletion of SAT1. ODC1 fl/fl CD4 cre were gifted by Dr. Erika Pearce (Max Planck Institute). For experiments, mice were matched for sex and age, and most mice were 6–10 weeks old. Littermate WT or Cre - mice were used as controls. All experiments were performed in accordance to the guidelines outlined by the Harvard Medical Area Standing Committee on Animals at the Harvard Medical School or the Brigham and Women’s hospital Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (Boston, MA).
For adoptive transfer EAE, naive T cells (CD4+CD44-CD62L+CD25-) were isolated from 2D2 TCR-transgenic mice and activated with anti-CD3 (1μg /ml) and anti-CD28 (1μg /ml) in the presence of differentiation cytokines for 68h. Cells were rested for 2 days and restimulated with plate-bound anti-CD3 (0.5μg/ml for pathogenic condition; 1μg/ml for non-pathogenic condition) and anti-CD28 (1μg/ml) for 2 days prior to transfer. Equal number (2 to 8 million) cells were transferred per mouse intravenously.
For active EAE immunization, MOG35-55 peptide was emulsified in complete freund adjuvant (CFA). Equivalent of 40μg MOG peptide was injected per mouse subcutaneously followed by pertussis toxin injection intravenously on day 0 and day 2 of immunization. Mice were treated with 0.5% DFMO in drinking water for 10 days as indicated. DFMO was replenished every third day.
EAE was scored as previously published ( Jäger et al., 2009 47. Jäger, A. ∙ Dardalhon, V. ∙ Sobel, R.A. ... Th1, Th17, and Th9 effector cells induce experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis with different pathological phenotypes J. Immunol. 2009; 183 :7169-7177 Crossref Scopus (519) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Intracellular cytokine staining was performed after incubation for 4-6h with Cell Stimulation cocktail plus Golgi transport inhibitors (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using the BD Cytofix/Cytoperm buffer set (BD Biosciences) per manufacturer’s instructions. Transcription factor staining was performed using the Foxp3/Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Set (eBioscience). Proliferation was assessed by staining with CellTrace Violet (Thermo Fisher Scientific) per manufacturer’s instructions. Apoptosis was assessed using Annexin V staining kit (BioLegend). Phosphorylation of proteins to determine cell signaling was performed with BD Phosflow buffer system (BD bioscience) as per manufacturer’s instructions.
Seahorse assay was performed and seahorse media was prepared following manufacturer instructions (Agilent). Approximately 50,000 T cells were seeded per well in 96 well plate for seahorse assay and readout were normalized against cell count.
Inhibitors are added at the time of differentiation as follows: 100-200μM DFMO, 500μM trans-4-methylcyclohexylamine (MCHA, both Sigma), 500μM N-(3-Amino-propyl)cyclohexylamine (APCHA, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 50μM diminazene aceturate (Dize, Cayman Chemical) with or without 2.5 mM putrescine (Sigma, P7505) as indicated.
543369581089400RNA was isolated using RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (QIAGEN) and reverse transcribed to cDNA with iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad). Gene expression was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR on a ViiA7 System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using TaqMan Fast Advanced Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with the following primer/probe sets: • Ass1 (Mm00711256 m1) • Odc1 (Mm02019269 g1) • Sat1 (Mm00485911 g1) • Srm (Mm00726089 s1) • Sms (Mm00786246 s1) • Il-17a (Mm00439618 m1) • Il-17f (Mm00521423 m1) • Foxp3 (Mm00475162 m1) • Tead1 (Mm00493507 m1) • Taz (Mm00504978 m1) • Actb (Applied Biosystems)
Expression values were calculated relative to Actb detected in the same sample by duplex qPCR.
Cell pellets of in vitro differentiated cells were frozen down and further processed with the Total Polyamine Assay Kit (BioVision Inc.) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Cytokine concentrations in supernatants of in vitro cultures were analyzed by the LegendPlex Mouse Th Cytokine Panel (13-plex) (BioLegend) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and analyzed on a FACS LSR II (BD Biosciences).
For population (bulk) RNA-seq, in vitro differentiated T cells were sorted for live cells and lysed with RLT Plus buffer and RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (QIAGEN). Full-length RNA-Seq libraries were prepared as previously described ( Singer et al., 2016 100. Singer, M. ∙ Wang, C. ∙ Cong, L. ... A Distinct Gene Module for Dysfunction Uncoupled from Activation in Tumor-Infiltrating T Cells Cell. 2016; 166 :1500-1511e9 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (161) PubMed Google Scholar ) and paired-end sequenced (75 bp 2) with a 150 cycle Nextseq 500 high output V2 kit.
Full experimental details are given in Gaublomme et al. (2015) 34. Gaublomme, J.T. ∙ Yosef, N. ∙ Lee, Y. ... Single-Cell Genomics Unveils Critical Regulators of Th17 Cell Pathogenicity Cell. 2015; 163 :1400-1412 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (284) PubMed Google Scholar . Briefly, we sequenced CD4+ naive T cells 48hrs post polarization under the pathogenic (Th17p) or non-pathogenic (Th17n), ultimately retaining after quality tests 151 IL-17A/GFP+ Th17n cells, and 139 IL-17A/GFP+ Th17p cells. Unlike Gaublomme et al. (2015) 34. Gaublomme, J.T. ∙ Yosef, N. ∙ Lee, Y. ... Single-Cell Genomics Unveils Critical Regulators of Th17 Cell Pathogenicity Cell. 2015; 163 :1400-1412 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (284) PubMed Google Scholar , in the present study we analyze only IL-17A/GFP+ sorted cells.
We aligned single-cell SMART-Seq libraries with Bowtie2, quantified TPM gene expression with RSEM, and performed QC as we described in detail in a previous publication ( Fletcher et al., 2017 32. Fletcher, R.B. ∙ Das, D. ∙ Gadye, L. ... Deconstructing Olfactory Stem Cell Trajectories at Single-Cell Resolution Cell Stem Cell. 2017; 20 :817-830.e8 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (77) PubMed Google Scholar ). This computational pipeline is a massively revised and updated version of the one originally used to analyze these libraries ( Gaublomme et al., 2015 34. Gaublomme, J.T. ∙ Yosef, N. ∙ Lee, Y. ... Single-Cell Genomics Unveils Critical Regulators of Th17 Cell Pathogenicity Cell. 2015; 163 :1400-1412 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (284) PubMed Google Scholar ). Batch effects and other nuisance factors were normalized with a model chosen empirically with SCONE ( Cole et al., 2019 22. Cole, M.B. ∙ Risso, D. ∙ Wagner, A. ... Performance Assessment and Selection of Normalization Procedures for Single-Cell RNA-Seq Cell Syst. 2019; 8 :315-328.e8 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Bulk RNA-Seq were processed with a modified variant of the same pipeline, or with a Kallisto ( Bray et al., 2016 13. Bray, N.L. ∙ Pimentel, H. ∙ Melsted, P. ... Near-optimal probabilistic RNA-seq quantification Nat. Biotechnol. 2016; 34 :525-527 Crossref Scopus (2360) PubMed Google Scholar ) pipeline. Both gave similar results.
For the Smart-Seq libraries, due the absence of UMIs in the dataset, differentially expressed genes were called through a linear model fitted to TPM values with the limma R package and with a mean-variance trend added to the empirical Bayes prior ( Ritchie et al., 2015 91. Ritchie, M.E. ∙ Phipson, B. ∙ Wu, D. ... limma powers differential expression analyses for RNA-sequencing and microarray studies Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43 :e47 Crossref Scopus (9097) PubMed Google Scholar ). For the bulk RNA libraries, differentially expressed genes were called with limma-trend or limma-voom ( Law et al., 2014 57. Law, C.W. ∙ Chen, Y. ∙ Shi, W. ... voom: Precision weights unlock linear model analysis tools for RNA-seq read counts Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :R29 Crossref Scopus (2030) PubMed Google Scholar ) depending on the variance of library sizes, as recommended in the limma package manual. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were decided by cutoffs of BH-adjusted p ≤ 0.05 fold-change of at least 1.5 in absolute value.
Bulk RNA libraries from DFMO- or vehicle-treated Th17p, Th17n, or Treg were studied with 3 replicates per condition for a total of 18 libraries as shown in Figure 6 A. In all subsequent analyses, genes are considered differentially expressed by the cutoffs defined above.
The PCA shown in Figure 6A was computed on the set of 3,414 that were differentially expressed in comparisons of vehicle-treated Th17 (i.e., Th17n or Th17p) versus with iTreg, or vehicle-treated Th17p versus Th17n to focus it on the subspace of the transcriptome relevant to Th17 pathogenicity phenotypes.
Genes that are associated with a Th17 or Treg programs (orange and purple, respectively, in Figures 6 B and 6C) were determined by differential expression test between bulk RNA libraries of vehicle-treated Th17 (i.e., Th17n or Th17p) one side and iTreg on the other. Similar results were obtained when the definition of the Th17 program (orange curve) and Treg programs was based on a comparison of only Th17n against iTreg cells.
A similar analysis was performed on the independent bulk-RNA dataset that involved Jmjd3 conditional knockout ( Figures 6 H and S6 F). Th17 and Treg programs were defined based on differential expression of the vehicle-treated conditions from the dataset (i.e., not borrowed from the results of comparison within the previous dataset). Note, however, that no Th17p cells were included in this dataset, and therefore the Th17 program (orange curve) in Figures 6 H and S6 F is based on a comparison of Th17n against iTreg cells. Th17 and Treg-associated peaks in ATAC-Seq (Figure 6D) were similarly defined based on the ATAC-Seq dataset.
To further stratify genes into Th17-related programs ( Figure S9 A; based on the bulk RNA dataset shown in Figure 6 A), we applied a heuristic based on four comparisons (all in vehicle-treated cells): • Th17 (i.e., Th17n or Th17p) versus iTreg • Th17p versus iTreg • Th17n versus iTreg • Th17p versus Th17n
The comparisons are decided based on differentially expression with the cutoffs defined above. A label is assigned to each gene as follows: 1. IF Th17 versus iTreg = = iTreg AND Th17p versus iTreg = = iTreg AND Th17n versus iTreg = = iTreg THEN RETURN Treg (purple) 2. ELSE IF Th17 versus iTreg ≠ iTreg AND Th17p versus iTreg = = Th17p AND Th17p versus Th17n = = Th17p THEN RETURN Th17p (magenta) 3. ELSE IF Th17 versus iTreg ≠ iTreg AND Th17n versus iTreg = = Th17n AND Th17p versus Th17n = = Th17n THEN RETURN Th17n (green) 4. ELSE IF Th17 versus iTreg = = Th17 THEN RETURN Th17 (orange) 5. ELSE RETURN NS (gray)
The gene is associated with the Th17n, Th17p, general Th17, or Treg program by the returned label.
For untargeted metabolomics, Th17 cells were differentiated as described. Culture media were snap frozen. Cells were harvested at 96h. 1 10 6 cells per sample were snap frozen and extracted in either 80% methanol (for fatty acids and oxylipids) or isopropanol (for polar and nonpolar lipids). Two liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS) methods were used to measure fatty acids and lipids in cell extracts.
For carbon tracing experiments Th17 cells were differentiated as described. At 68hrs, cells were washed and cultured in media supplemented with 8mM [U-13C]-glucose for 15min or 3hrs. Alternatively, at 68hrs, cells were washed and cultured in media supplemented with arginine ( 13 C6, Sigma, Cat 643440) or aspartic acid ( 13 C4, Sigma, Cat 604852) for 1, 5 and 24 hours.
Differentially abundant metabolites were found with Student’s t test and a significance threshold of BH-adjusted p < 0.1.
To find metabolites with differential 13C relative abundance, we computed the ratio y i,j of 13C out of the total carbon contents for each metabolite i in sample j . Let |C i | be the number of carbon atoms in metabolite i , and let x c,i,j be the measured signal of metabolite i in sample j (subsequent to all normalization and QC procedures) in which there are exactly c 13C atoms. We define the 13C/C ratio: 𝑦 𝑖 , 𝑗 = ∑ ∣ 𝐶 𝑖 ∣ 𝑡 = 0 𝑡 ⋅ 𝑥 𝑡 . 𝑖 . 𝑗 | 𝐶 𝑖 | ⋅ ∑ ∣ 𝐶 𝑖 ∣ 𝑡 = 0 𝑥 𝑡 . 𝑖 . 𝑗
In this work, we define we core metabolism based on reaction metadata included in the Recon2 database. Recon2 assigns a confidence score to each reaction based on the level of evidence supporting it between 1 (no evidence) and 4 (biochemical evidence), with 0 denoting reactions whose confidence was not evaluated. Since pathways generally considered part of primary metabolism are also the best studied ones, we define a reaction as belonging to core metabolism if (a) its Recon2 confidence is either 0 or 4; and (b) it is annotated with an EC (Enzyme Commission) number. We chose to label reactions with unevaluated confidence (i.e., Recon2 confidence score of 0) as part of core metabolism because some of them were found to be key reactions in primary metabolic pathways based on manual correction. Our definition of core metabolism is equivalent to taking the set of all metabolic reactions in Recon2, but excluding reactions that either don’t have an annotated EC number or for which the Recon2 curators explicitly specified they do not have direct biochemical support. We define a meta-reaction as belonging to core metabolism if it contains at least one core reaction. Core pathways are defined as Recon2 subsystems that have at least 3 core reactions. Metabolic genes are defined as the set of genes annotated in Recon2.
To test for differential potential-activity of reactions based on Compass predictions, we computed for each meta-reaction M the Wilcoxon’s rank sum between the Compass scores of M in the two populations of interest (here, Th17p and Th17n). Effect size were further assessed with Cohen’s d statistic, defined as the difference between the sample means over the pooled sample standard deviation. Let n 1 , x 1 , s 1 be the number of observations in population 1, and the sample mean and standard deviation of their scores in a given meta-reaction, respectively (with a similar notation for population 2). Then 𝑑 = ( ̅ 𝑥 1 − ̅ 𝑥 1 ) 𝑠 with 𝑠 = √ ( 𝑛 1 − 1 ) ⁢ 𝑠 2 1 + ( 𝑛 2 − 1 ) ⁢ 𝑠 2 2 𝑛 1 + 𝑛 2 − 2 The resulting p values are adjusted with the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) method. Note that so far, the computation was done for meta-reactions. We assigned all reactions r ∈ M the Cohen’s d and Wilcoxon’s p value that were computed for M . We call a reaction differentially active if its adjusted p is smaller than 0.1. The computation was done on all reactions in the network (namely, both core and non-core reactions).
We manually curated the significant predictions of the central carbon metabolism pathways discussed in the manuscript (glycolysis, TCA cycle, and fatty acid synthesis/oxidation). Recon2 takes account of metabolite localization, and reactions may be functional in more than one cellular compartment. For every reaction, we picked the prediction corresponding to the pertinent cellular compartment (here, cytosol or mitochondria, as shown in Figure 4 A). Note that Compass operates independently on the forward and backward directions of every reaction, and that the direction is denoted in the pathway diagrams of this manuscript.
We used a transcriptomic signature that we have previously shown to capture a Th17 cell’s pathogenic capacity ( Gaublomme et al., 2015 34. Gaublomme, J.T. ∙ Yosef, N. ∙ Lee, Y. ... Single-Cell Genomics Unveils Critical Regulators of Th17 Cell Pathogenicity Cell. 2015; 163 :1400-1412 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (284) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2015 109. Wang, C. ∙ Yosef, N. ∙ Gaublomme, J. ... CD5L/AIM Regulates Lipid Biosynthesis and Restrains Th17 Cell Pathogenicity Cell. 2015; 163 :1413-1427 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (175) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, for each cell compute the average z-scored expression (log(1 +TPM)) of pro-pathogenic markers (CASP1, CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, CSF2, CXCL3, GZMB, ICOS, IL22, IL7R, LAG3, LGALS3, LRMP, STAT4, TBX21) and pro-regulatory markers (AHR, IKZF3, IL10, IL1RN, IL6ST, IL9, MAF), with the latter group multiplied by −1.
A compendium of T cell state transcriptomic signatures was described in Gaublomme et al. (2015) 34. Gaublomme, J.T. ∙ Yosef, N. ∙ Lee, Y. ... Single-Cell Genomics Unveils Critical Regulators of Th17 Cell Pathogenicity Cell. 2015; 163 :1400-1412 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (284) PubMed Google Scholar . Every signature consists of two gene subsets: a set of positively associated genes and an optionally empty set of negatively associated genes. A scalar signature value is computed for every cell based on its transcriptome profile as described above for pathogenicity. Signatures that are based on KEGG ( Kanehisa et al., 2017 52. Kanehisa, M. ∙ Furumichi, M. ∙ Tanabe, M. ... KEGG: new perspectives on genomes, pathways, diseases and drugs Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45 :D353-D361 Crossref Scopus (2897) PubMed Google Scholar ) pathways or similar resources are constructed by defining the set of positively-associated genes as the ones belonging to the pathway and defining the set of negatively-associated genes as an empty set.
We defined the total metabolic activity of a cell as the sum expression of metabolic enzyme coding genes over the sum expression of all protein coding genes in log-scale TPM (transcripts per million) units. We computed the partial correlation between this quantity and cell PC1 coordinates, while controlling for the sum expression of all protein coding genes in the cells (the aforementioned divisor) to verify the correlation does not arise from the ratio of protein-coding to non-protein coding RNA in the RNA libraries. The correlation was more significant when not controlling for the covariate (Pearson rho = 0.56, p < 3 · 10 − 16 ).
We defined a transcriptomic signature for late-stage differentiation of Th17 cells based on microarray data from Yosef et al. (2013) 112. Yosef, N. ∙ Shalek, A.K. ∙ Gaublomme, J.T. ... Dynamic regulatory network controlling TH17 cell differentiation Nature. 2013; 496 :461-468 Crossref Scopus (434) PubMed Google Scholar . We assigned microarrays into three differentiation stages as described in that paper into early (up to 4h), intermediate (6-16h) and late (20-72h) and fitted with the limma R package a linear model for the discrete 3-level stage covariate. We called differentially expressed genes (BH-adjusted p < 0.05 and log2 fold-change ≥ 3) and used them to define a transcriptomic signature as described above.
For population ATAC-Seq, in vitro differentiated T cells were sorted for live cells and stored in Bambanker freezing media (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at −80 ◦ C until further processing. Prior to library preparation, cells were thawed at 37 ◦ C and washed with PBS. For ATAC-Seq, cell pellets were lysed and tagmented in 1X TD Buffer, 0.2μl TDE1 (Illumina), 0.01% digitonin, and 0.3X PBS in 40μl reaction volume following the protocol described in Corces et al. (2016) 24. Corces, M.R. ∙ Buenrostro, J.D. ∙ Wu, B. ... Lineage-specific and single-cell chromatin accessibility charts human hematopoiesis and leukemia evolution Nat. Genet. 2016; 48 :1193-1203 Crossref Scopus (360) PubMed Google Scholar . Transposition reactions were incubated at 37for 30 min at 300 rpm. The DNA was purified from the reaction using a MinElute PCR purification kit (QIAGEN). The whole resulting product was then PCR-amplified using indexed primers with NEBNext High-Fidelity 2X PCR Master Mix (NEB). First, we performed 5 cycles of pre-amplification. We sampled 10% of the pre-amplification reaction for SYBR Green quantitative PCR to assess the number of additional cycles needed for final amplification. After purifying the final library with the MinElute PCR purification kit (QIAGEN), the library was quantified for sequencing using qPCR and a Qubit dsDNA HS Assay kit (Invitrogen). Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 550 system with paired-end reads of 37 base pairs in length.
All ATAC-Seq reads were trimmed using Trimmomatic ( Bolger et al., 2014 10. Bolger, A.M. ∙ Lohse, M. ∙ Usadel, B. Trimmomatic: a flexible trimmer for Illumina sequence data Bioinformatics. 2014; 30 :2114-2120 Crossref Scopus (18010) PubMed Google Scholar ) to remove primer and low-quality bases. Reads smaller than 36bp were dropped. Reads were then passed to FastQC [ https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/ ] to check the quality of the trimmed reads. The paired-end reads were then aligned to the mm10 reference genome using bowtie2 ( Langmead and Salzberg, 2012 56. Langmead, B. ∙ Salzberg, S.L. Fast gapped-read alignment with Bowtie 2 Nat.

Reads with a mapping quality (MAPQ) below 30 were removed. Duplicates were removed with PicardTools, and the reads mapping to the blacklist regions and mitochondrial DNA were also removed. Reads mapping to the positive strand were moved +4bp, and reads mapping to the negative strand were moved −5bp following the procedure outlined in Buenrostro et al. (2013) 16.

Peaks were called using macs2 on the aligned fragments ( Zhang et al., 2008 113. Zhang, Y. ∙ Liu, T. ∙ Meyer, C.A. ... Model-based analysis of ChIP-Seq (MACS) Genome Biol. 2008; 9 :R137 Crossref Scopus (6554) PubMed Google Scholar ) with a qvalue cutoff of 0.001 and overlapping peaks among replicates were merged.
Differential accessibility was assessed using DESeq2 ( Love et al., 2014 65. Love, M.I. ∙ Huber, W. ∙ Anders, S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2 Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :550 Crossref Scopus (18710) PubMed Google Scholar ) with a matrix of peaks (merging all samples) by samples. Similar to common practice in the analysis of differential gene expression, our analysis of differential accessibility was conducted using the number of observed Tn5 cuts (i.e., number of reads).
Peaks that are associated with a Th17 or Treg programs (orange and purple, respectively, in Figure 6 D) were determined by differential accessibility test between libraries of vehicle-treated (water) Th17n and Th17p on one side (unpublished dataset) and Treg on the other with BH-adjusted p ≤ 0.05 and absolute value of log2 fold-change of at least 1.

ChIP-Seq peaks were called in each replicate, versus a control sample, using macs2 ( Zhang et al., 2008 113. Zhang, Y. ∙ Liu, T. ∙ Meyer, C.A. ... Model-based analysis of ChIP-Seq (MACS) Genome Biol. 2008; 9 :R137 Crossref Scopus (6554) PubMed Google Scholar ) with a qvalue cutoff of 0.05.

A stoichiometric matrix S describes the set of possible metabolic reactions in the system. Its rows correspond to metabolites, columns to reactions, and entries hold the stoichiometric coefficients of the reactions available to the cells.
A metabolic flux is the instantaneous rate in which a chemical reaction occurs, and measured in units of mol X gDW -1 X hr -1 , with gDW denoting gram dry weight. Let x be metabolite concentrations in the system (as a function of time t ), and v be the metabolic fluxes (also called flux distribution ). Then: 𝑆 ⋅ 𝑣 = 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑥 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑡 Compass belongs to the family of static FBA algorithms ( Orth et al., 2010 82. Orth, J.D. ∙ Thiele, I. ∙ Palsson, B.O. What is flux balance analysis? Nat. Biotechnol. 2010; 28 :245-248 Crossref Scopus (1850) PubMed Google Scholar ), which assumes metabolic steady-state, i.e. 𝑆 ⋅ 𝑣 = 0 Equivalently, we limit the space of feasible flux distributions to k e r ⁡ ( 𝑆 ) .
Compass leverages prior knowledge about the metabolic network of the cells in question in the form of a Genome-Scale Metabolic Model (GSMM), which includes the following components ( Heirendt et al., 2019 42. Heirendt, L. ∙ Arreckx, S. ∙ Pfau, T. ... Creation and analysis of biochemical constraint-based models using the COBRA Toolbox v.3.0 Nat.

Systems Biology: Constraint-Based Reconstruction and Analysis Cambridge University Press, 2015 Crossref Google Scholar ): • A stoichiometric matrix S • Reactions are partitioned into cellular compartments representing membrane-enclosed space in which a biochemical reaction may take place, for example the cytosol, Golgi, or mitochondria. • Metabolites are represented separately for each compartment. For example, cytosolic citrate and mitochondrial citrate correspond to two rows in S. • Reactions may contain non-zero coefficients for metabolites located in different compartment to represent physiological transportation of metabolites across membranes. These reactions are called Transport reactions. • The extracellular space is represented as an additional compartment. • Reactions may have exactly one non-zero coefficient if the corresponding metabolite is located in the extracellular space. These reactions are called exchange reactions and used to import metabolites into or export them from the system. It is standard convention to assign −1 as the non-zero coefficient of exchange reactions. • Upper and lower bounds on fluxes through the reactions corresponding to columns of S. • Lower bounds of exchange reactions limit metabolite uptake and used to simulate constraints on nutrient availability. Note these are the lower, and not upper, bounds because the exchange coefficient is −1. • A set if genes coding enzymes that catalyze reactions in the network • Gene-to-reaction associations: • Every reaction is associated with a boolean expression over gene literals and the { ∨ , ∧ } operators. • Every gene is assigned a truth value based on its presence or absence in the cell’s genome. A gene may be absent, for example, in a knockout genotype. • The boolean expressions code the dependency of reactions on their catalyzing proteins. Usually, an OR relationship corresponds to isozymes, namely two enzymes capable of catalyzing the same reaction, and AND relationship corresponds to enzyme complexes.
In the following sections we denote: • n : number of cells (or RNA libraries). • m : number of metabolic reactions in the GSMM. • C : the set of cells in the data. ( |C| = n ). • R : the set of metabolic reactions in the GSMM. ( |R| = m ). • rev ( r ): the reverse unidirectional reaction of reaction r , which has the same stoichiometry but proceeds in the opposite direction. • g : number of genes in a given transcriptome dataset. • S : the stoichiometric matrix defined in the GSMM, where rows represent metabolites, columns represent reactions, and entries are stoichiometric coefficients for the reactions comprising the metabolic network. Reactions for uptake and secretion of a metabolite are encoded as having only a coefficient of 1 and −1 in the metabolite’s row entry, respectively, and 0 otherwise.
For a matrix M = ( m i,j ) and a function f: ℝ ➝ ℝ we use f ( M ) to denote (where the intention is obvious from the context) the respective point-wise transformation, namely f ( M ): = ( f ( m i,j )).
For a given GSMM (here, Recon2), we run once a preparatory step that does not depend on transcriptome data and cache the results (Algorithm 1).
center102108000Constraint (i) constrains the system to steady state ( Varma and Palsson, 1994 106. Varma, A. ∙ Palsson, B.O. Metabolic Flux Balancing: Basic Concepts, Scientific and Practical Use Nat. Biotechnol. 1994; 12 :994-998 Crossref Google Scholar ). Constraint (ii) is interpreted as ∀ i: α i ≤ v i ≤ β i and encodes directionality and capacity limits for reactions, including uptake and secretion limits. Constraint (iii) ensures that when evaluating the maximum flux for each reaction, its reverse reaction carries no flux to avoid the creation of a futile cycle. This does not prevent futile cycles longer than 2 edges, which can be avoided only by more time-consuming computations ( Schellenberger et al., 2011 95. Schellenberger, J. ∙ Lewis, N.E. ∙ Palsson, B.Ø. Elimination of thermodynamically infeasible loops in steady-state metabolic models Biophys. J. 2011; 100 :544-553 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (112) PubMed Google Scholar ). Figure viewer
Note that the GSMM may contain blocked reactions ( v opt = 0) that can be excluded from the next steps to speed the computation.
By reaction expression, we denote a matrix {R ( G ) } m × n that is conceptually similar to the gene expression matrix G g × n . The columns are the same RNA libraries (e.g., cells) as in {G} , but rows represent single metabolic reactions rather than transcripts. An entry R r,j in the matrix R ( G ) is a quantitative proxy for the activity of reaction r in cell j . We omit the dependence on gene expression matrix and denote simply R when G is obvious from the context.
The reaction expression matrix is created by using the boolean gene-to-reaction mapping included in the GSMM, similar to the approach taken by ( Becker and Palsson, 2008 6. Becker, S.A. ∙ Palsson, B.O. Context-specific metabolic networks are consistent with experiments PLoS Comput. Biol. 2008; 4 :e1000082 Crossref Scopus (345) PubMed Google Scholar ; Shlomi et al., 2008 98. Shlomi, T. ∙ Cabili, M.N. ∙ Herrgård, M.J. ... Network-based prediction of human tissue-specific metabolism Nat. Biotechnol. 2008; 26 :1003-1010 Crossref Scopus (438) PubMed Google Scholar ) Let G = x i,j and consider a particular reaction r in a particular cell j . If a single gene with linear-scale expression x is associated with r , then the reaction’s expression will be R r,j = log2( x + 1). If no genes are associated with r then R r,j = 0.
If the reaction is associated with more than one gene, then this association is expressed as a boolean relationship. For example, two genes which encode different subunits of a reaction’s enzyme are associated using an AND relationship as both are required to be expressed for the reaction to be catalyzed. Alternately, if multiple enzymes can catalyze a reaction, the genes involved in each will be associated via an OR relationship. For reactions associated with multiple genes in this manner, the boolean expression is evaluated by taking the sum or the mean of linear-scale expression values x when genes are associated via an OR or AND relationship, respectively. This way, the full gene(s)-to-reaction associations is evaluated to arrive at a single summary expression value for each reaction in the GSMM.
To mitigate the sparseness and stochasticity of single-cell measurements, Compass allows for a degree of information-sharing between cells with similar transcriptional profiles. Given a gene expression G , we compute k -nearest neighbors (kNN) graph based Euclidean distances in reduced dimension, obtained by taking the top 20 principal components of G . The PCA is computed over all the genes in G , not only metabolic ones.
Let R ( G ) = {r i,j } and 𝑤 𝑖 , 𝑗 = { 1 𝑘 , i ⁢ f c ⁢ e ⁢ l ⁢ l 𝑗 i ⁢ s i ⁢ n t ⁢ h ⁢ e 𝑘 − n ⁢ e ⁢ a ⁢ r ⁢ e ⁢ s ⁢ t − n ⁢ e ⁢ i ⁢ g ⁢ h ⁢ b ⁢ o ⁢ r ⁢ h ⁢ o ⁢ o ⁢ d o ⁢ f c ⁢ e ⁢ l ⁢ l 𝑖 , o , o ⁢ t ⁢ h ⁢ e ⁢ r ⁢ w ⁢ i ⁢ s ⁢ e Then R N ( G ) = {r N i,j } where 𝑟 𝑁 𝑖 , 𝑗 = ∑ 𝑐 ∈ 𝐶 𝑤 𝑗 , 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑟 𝑖 , 𝑐
Compass transforms a gene expression matrix {G} g × n , where rows represent genes and columns represent RNA libraries (usually, single cells, although bulk RNA can also be used as discussed below) into a matrix {C} m × n of scores where rows represent metabolic reactions, columns are the same RNA libraries as in the gene expression, and an entry quantifies a proxy for potential reaction activity. More precisely, the entry quantifies the propensity of the cell to use that reaction.
The algorithm is summarized in (Algorithm 2). First, we convert the gene expression matrix G g × n into a reaction expression matrix R m × n which is parallel to the gene expression matrix, but with rows representing single metabolic reactions rather than transcripts. We convert R into a penalty matrix P m × n by point-wise inversion. Whereas R represents gene expression support that a reaction is functional in the cell, P represents the lack thereof (which will be used in a linear program below). The computation of R and P occurs also for the neighborhood of each cell for to smooth results and mitigate single-cell technical noise. Then, we solve a linear program for every reaction r in every cell i to find the minimal resistance of cell i to carry maximal flux through r . Last, we scale the scores, which also entails negating them such that that larger scores will represent larger potential activities (instead of larger penalties, hence smaller potential activity). The final scores indicative of a cell’s propensity to use a certain reaction. We interpret it as a proxy for the potential activity of the reaction in that cell.
In step 10 of Algorithm 2, a high penalty yr, c indicates that cell c is unlikely, judged by transcriptomic evidence, to use reaction r . Cells whose transcriptome are overall more aligned with an ability to carry flux through a reaction will be assigned a lower penalty yr, c . With regards to the correctness of the step, recall that that the GSMM is unidirectional and therefore ∀i. v i > 0. Figure viewer
Rows in the C raw matrix that correspond to reactions that are topologically close in the metabolic network can be highly correlated. We therefore hierarchically cluster C raw rows by Spearman distance. We call the resulting clusters meta-reactions and each represents a set of closely correlated metabolic reactions. Note that the division into meta-reactions is data-driven and does not rely on canonical metabolic pathway definitions. Therefore, the division is dataset-dependent — for example, two reactions might be closely correlated and clustered in the same meta-reaction in one cell type, but not in another.
After computing the hierarchical clusters over rows of C raw , we merged leaves in which Spearman similarity (namely 1 − ρ , with ρ being the Spearman correlation) by averaging the respective rows. In the present work, we used ρ = 0.98. We denote the row-merged matrix {C meta−raw } mXn .
center88265000By definition, all entries in C meta−raw are non-negative. We scale it in Algorithm 3 (the min in the second step denotes matrix-wide minimal entry)
One of the intuitions behind Compass is that the statistical power afforded by the number of observations (cells) in Figure viewer single-cell RNA-Seq allows increasing dimensionality by computing a new feature set based on the gene expression data and the GSMM. Here, we used an intuitive set of objective functions — for each reaction in the network, we defined one objective function which is to maximize the flux it carries (recall that the network is unidirectional and therefore all reactions carry non-negative fluxes). This allows intuitive interpretation of the Compass scores as quantitative proxies to reaction activities. However, the algorithm can be generalized by using an arbitrary set of linear objective functions that pertain to cellular metabolism.
For prohibitively large datasets, the number of cells (observations) can be reduced by partitioning the cells into small clusters and treating the average of each cluster as an observation in downstream analysis. Two implementations of this approach are micropools ( DeTomaso et al., 2019 27. DeTomaso, D. ∙ Jones, M.G. ∙ Subramaniam, M. ... Functional interpretation of single cell similarity maps Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :4376 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ) implemented in the VISION R package ( https://github.com/YosefLab/VISION ), and meta-cells ( Baran et al., 2019 3. Baran, Y. ∙ Bercovich, A. ∙ Sebe-Pedros, A. ... MetaCell: analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data using K-nn graph partitions Genome Biol. 2019; 20 :206 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( https://tanaylab.github.io/metacell ). No pooling was necessary for the analysis presented in this manuscript (i.e., the results are on a single cell level). If cell clusters are large enough, one may choose to skip the information-sharing procedure, which is equivalent to setting the parameter λ = 0 in Algorithm 2.
In addition, the number of reactions in the GSMM can be reduced as well by not executing Algorithm 2 on blocked reactions (Section 1.3) non-core reactions (Section 1.11.2), or reactions outside a predetermined set of metabolic pathways that are of interest. We note that we do not suggest excluding non-blocked reactions from the network altogether (which would result in neglecting their effects on reactions that are of interest), but rather only excluding them from the R ( G ) matrices in Algorithm 2.
We used the Recon2 GSMM ( Thiele et al., 2013 103. Thiele, I. ∙ Swainston, N. ∙ Fleming, R.M.T. ... A community-driven global reconstruction of human metabolism Nat. Biotechnol. 2013; 31 :419-425 Crossref Scopus (651) PubMed Google Scholar ) which we transformed into a unidirectional network by replacing bidirectional reactions with the respective pair of unidirectional reactions. Consequently, flux values are always non-negative.
The results of flux balance analysis significantly depend on the nutrients made available to the GSMM, referred to as the in silico growth medium. Since exact medium composition is mostly unknown even for common in vitro protocols and in vivo models, we chose a rich in silico medium where all nutrients for which a transporter exits are made available in an unlimiting quantity.
The main input is gene expression matrix G in which rows correspond to genes and columns to RNA libraries. We assume that G is (i) already normalized to remove batch and other nuisance effects; (ii) scaled to CPMs or TPMs. In the present work we used TPMs; and (iii) in linear (i.e., not log) scale.
Throughout this work, metabolic genes are defined as the set of genes annotated in Recon2. Note that Compass uses only the expression of metabolic genes and ignores other transcripts.
The current manuscript presents the algorithm in the context of single cells, where Compass leverages the statistical power afforded by the large number of observations (cells). Nevertheless, there is no inherent limitation preventing one from applying Compass to study bulk (i.e., non-single-cell) transcriptomic data. In this case, we recommend disabling the information-sharing feature by setting lambda = 0 in Algorithm 2. There is also no limitation preventing one from applying Compass to non-RNA-Seq transcriptomic data, such as microarrays.
Unless otherwise specified, the tests performed were two-tail Welch t tests using Prism software. P values were adjusted with the Bonferroni method for multiple comparisons where appropriate. P value less than 0.05 is considered significant (p < 0.05 = ∗ ; p < 0.01 = ∗∗ ; p < 0.001 = ∗∗∗ ) unless otherwise indicated.

Statistical significance of global transcriptomic shifts, related to Figures 6C, 6D, and 6H (A-B) Test of the null hypothesis that the Th17 and NS curves (orange and gray respectively in Figure 6) or Treg and NS curves (purple and gray, respectively) have the same mean logFC in a differential gene expression (A), or differential peak accessibility (B) comparison between DFMO-treated and vehicle-treated cells. (C) Test of the null hypothesis that the Th17 and NS curves or Treg and NS curves have the same mean logFC in a differential gene expression comparison between JMJD3 cKO and WT cells. (D) Test whether the Th17, Treg, or NS programs in Th17n or iTreg have the same mean logFC in a differential gene expression comparison between JMJD3 cKO and WT cells under DFMO-treatment and vehicle-treatment conditions (dotted and solid curves, respectively). Welch t test (A-C), or paired Welch t test (D) adjusted for multiple comparisons with the Holm-Bonferroni method. Spreadsheet (409.28 KB) Table S6. Hard-decisions for differential expression tests, related to Figures 6A–6C Differential expressed gene decisions for the comparisons described with relation to Figures 6A–6C and S6A. Columns B-H: for the comparison specified in the column’s title, the decision for each gene is encoded as “up” (upregulated in the left-hand side condition), “NS” (not significantly different between the conditions), or “down” (downregulated in the left-hand side condition). Column I: Further stratification of genes into Th17p, Th17n, general Th17, or Treg programs (as in Figure S6A). See STAR Methods for differential expression procedures, cutoffs, and stratification heuristic. Spreadsheet (2.89 MB) Table S7. Differentially accessible peaks between DFMO- and vehicle-treated Th17 or Treg cells, related to Figures 6D–6F (A) Detected peaks in ATAC-Seq dataset were tested for differential accessibility between DFMO-treated and untreated Th17n or iTreg cells. The Th17 and Treg programs (orange and purple curves in Figure 6D, respectively) were defined by comparison of the untreated Th17n versus iTreg cells (only Th17n cells, unlike in the RNA data described in Figure 6C due to the lack of Th17p in the data). Peaks were associated with genes with the GREAT software. (B) Differentially accessible peaks in ATAC-Seq dataset were associated with pathways with GREAT. (C-D) Hypergeometric test results of the enrichment of putative binding sites (based on DNA binding motifs or ChIP-Seq data when available) that significantly overlap with regions whose accessibility is modulated by DFMO in Th17n cells. Only Th17 (C) or Treg-specific (D) regions (defined as peaks differentially more or less accessible in a comparison of Th17 and Treg, respectively) are considered.
