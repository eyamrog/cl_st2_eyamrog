Title: Structural Basis of Functional Transitions in Mammalian NMDA Receptors


Abstract: Summary

Excitatory neurotransmission meditated by glutamate receptors including N -methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) is pivotal to brain development and function. NMDARs are heterotetramers composed of GluN1 and GluN2 subunits, which bind glycine and glutamate, respectively, to activate their ion channels. Despite importance in brain physiology, the precise mechanisms by which activation and inhibition occur via subunit-specific binding of agonists and antagonists remain largely unknown. Here, we show the detailed patterns of conformational changes and inter-subunit and -domain reorientation leading to agonist-gating and subunit-dependent competitive inhibition by providing multiple structures in distinct ligand states at 4 Å or better. The structures reveal that activation and competitive inhibition by both GluN1 and GluN2 antagonists occur by controlling the tension of the linker between the ligand-binding domain and the transmembrane ion channel of the GluN2 subunit. Our results provide detailed mechanistic insights into NMDAR pharmacology, activation, and inhibition, which are fundamental to the brain physiology.

Section: Introduction

Fast excitatory synaptic transmission is the fundamental currency for brain development and high-order brain functions including learning and memory formation. It is largely facilitated by a combination of ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) including α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors, kainate receptors, and N -methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs). Synaptic currents and calcium signaling mediated by NMDARs are pivotal to neuroplasticity and are governed by diverse NMDAR subtypes defined by distinct hetero-tetrameric combinations of glycine binding GluN1 (1-4a or b) with either glutamate binding GluN2 (A-D) subunits and/or glycine binding GluN3 (A-B) subunits ( Hansen et al., 2018 23.

Dysfunctional NMDARs are implicated in various neurological diseases and disorders including Alzheimer’s disease, depression, stroke, epilepsy, and schizophrenia ( Paoletti et al., 2013 49.

Furthermore, recent studies showed that neuroendocrine/ductal pancreatic cancers and breast cancers express NMDARs to mediate signaling for invasive tumor growth and brain metastasis, respectively ( Li and Hanahan, 2013 36.

Therefore, there are pressing needs to deepen mechanistic understanding of NMDAR functions to facilitate potential development of therapeutic reagents for not only neurological diseases and disorders, but also cancers. The most typical NMDARs contain two copies each of GluN1 and GluN2, which activate upon binding of the co-agonist glycine and the neurotransmitter agonist glutamate ( Benveniste and Mayer, 1991 5.

NMDARs bind agonists and competitive antagonists at ligand-binding domains (LBDs) whereas many allosteric modulators bind at either amino terminal domains (ATDs) or LBDs to regulate opening and closing of the ion channel transmembrane domain (TMD) ( Figure 1 A). There has been progress in understanding the function of NMDARs in the last decade because of availability of structures of both isolated domains (ATDs and LBDs) ( Furukawa and Gouaux, 2003 19.

All of the structures of agonist-bound intact NMDARs, including GluN1-GluN2B, GluN1-GluN2A, and GluN1-GluN2A-GluN2B NMDARs show extensive ATD-LBD interaction unlike AMPA and kainate receptors where ATD-LBD interactions are minimal, indicating that protein conformational changes in NMDAR ATDs and LBDs are coupled to each other ( Hansen et al., 2018 23.

Dissecting diverse functions of NMDA receptors by structural biology Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2019; 54 :34-42 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ). This structural observation is consistent with the capability of the ATD to control multiple functions including open probability, deactivation speeds, and allosteric inhibition by ATD-targeting compounds ( Gielen et al., 2009 21.

Although some patterns of protein conformational alterations between the ATD and the LBD were observed in mid to low range resolution structures (∼5–15 Å) ( Jalali-Yazdi et al., 2018 25. Jalali-Yazdi, F. ∙ Chowdhury, S. ∙ Yoshioka, C. ...

Mechanism of NMDA Receptor Inhibition and Activation Cell. 2016; 165 :704-714 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (158) PubMed Google Scholar ), how they actually control the TMD channel is not well defined. With respect to competitive antagonism, previous structures of Xenopus GluN1-GluN2B NMDARs bound to the classical competitive antagonists 5,7-dichlorokynureinic acid (DCKA) and D-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoate (D-AP5) showed unanticipated robust “rupture” of GluN1-GluN2B LBD dimers strikingly different from the structure of AMPA and kainate receptor competitive antagonist complexes ( Zhu et al., 2016 75. Zhu, S. ∙ Stein, R.A. ∙ Yoshioka, C. ... Mechanism of NMDA Receptor Inhibition and Activation Cell. 2016; 165 :704-714 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (158) PubMed Google Scholar ). The pattern of LBD coupling to the TMD channel in these structures remains elusive due to low resolution (9–15 Å) where density for the TMDs and the LBD-TMD linker are not resolved. Importantly, there is no clear understanding of how GluN1- and GluN2B-specific competitive antagonists are capable of inhibiting the channel activities while the other subunit is occupied with agonists. Thus, despite advances in NMDAR structural biology, the mechanism leading to channel activation and inhibition remain ambiguous. To overcome this, we improved sample preparation methods to obtain cryo-EM structures of GluN1b-GluN2B NMDARs at overall resolution of 4 Å or better in complex with agonists glycine (Gly) and glutamate (Glu), a GluN1-specific competitive antagonist, L689,560 (L689), and a GluN2-specific competitive antagonist, SDZ-220-040, (SDZ) in the following combinations: Gly/Glu-bound, Gly/SDZ-bound, L689/Glu-bound, and L689/SDZ-bound. The high-resolution structures located antagonists in the LBDs and resolve the majority of side chains in every domain thereby, confidently defining the functional states of the structures and local changes at the gate-region of the TMD channel resulting from agonist- and antagonist-binding and providing a comprehensive mechanistic scheme for functional transitions related to subunit-specific competitive inhibition. Our study provides the blueprint for mechanistic understanding of NMDAR pharmacology, activation, and inhibition.

Section: Results

Structural analysis of multi-domain heteromeric transmembrane proteins from the mammalian sources such as rat GluN1b-GluN2B NMDARs studied here, remain technically challenging because of low expression levels, improper multimeric assembly, and instability. To overcome these difficulties, we produced a rat GluN1b-GluN2B NMDAR construct (see STAR Methods ) in the Sf 9 insect cell-baculovirus expression system where both GluN1b and GluN2B subunits are expressed under the combination of the Drosophila Hsp70 promoter and hr1 enhancer element ( Rodems and Friesen, 1993 52. Rodems, S.M. ∙ Friesen, P.D. The hr5 transcriptional enhancer stimulates early expression from the Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus genome but is not required for virus replication J. Virol. 1993; 67 :5776-5785 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) with a p10 3′ untranslated region (UTR) ( van Oers et al., 1999 63. van Oers, M.M. ∙ Vlak, J.M. ∙ Voorma, H.O. ... Role of the 3′ untranslated region of baculovirus p10 mRNA in high-level expression of foreign genes J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80 :2253-2262 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ) instead of the conventional polyhedrin and p10 late promoters. This modification resulted in production of 0.4 mg of properly assembled GluN1b-GluN2B NMDAR proteins per liter insect cell culture. Sample preparation with lower concentrations of lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol (0.002%) than in previous studies ( Regan et al., 2018 50. Regan, M.C. ∙ Grant, T. ∙ McDaniel, M.J. ...

Tajima, N. ∙ Karakas, E. ∙ Grant, T. ... Activation of NMDA receptors and the mechanism of inhibition by ifenprodil Nature. 2016; 534 :63-68 Crossref Scopus (169) PubMed Google Scholar ) and addition of 0.1% digitonin were crucial for particle integrity in cryo-EM images. For antagonist-bound samples, we observed protein aggregation in electron micrographs when an excessive amount (0.1 mM or above) of L689,560 or SDZ-220-040 was directly added during sample preparation. Thus, instead, we incorporated the antagonists by dialyzing GluN1b-GluN2B NMDAR purified in the absence of ligands against buffers containing 50 μM antagonist. Inclusion of EDTA and adjustment to pH 7.5 were also critical to eliminate ATD-mediated zinc and proton allosteric inhibition to monitor pure competitive inhibition. Finally, we collected large datasets containing 250,000–500,000 particle images to observe multiple protein conformations by effective 3D classification in single particle analysis. All of the above collectively contributed to structural analysis at a Fourier shell correlation-based resolution as high as 3.6 Å ( Table S1 ), and all of the structures reported here were sufficiently high resolution to resolve cryo-EM densities for antagonists, therefore allowing us to unambiguously define the functional states of individual structures.
We have previously reported cryo-EM structures of agonist-bound GluN1b-GluN2B; however, due to low resolution (∼6.0 Å) those structures did not resolve the linker region between the LBDs and TMDs, preventing assessment of how conformational alteration in the extracellular domains is transduced to the TMD ion channel to regulate activity. Using the improved methods described above, we obtained structures bound to the full agonists, glycine and glutamate, at ∼4 Å resolution as estimated by Fourier shell correlation using the 0.143 cutoff ( Figures 1 and S1 ; Table S1 ). Here, we observed clear cryo-EM density for all of the domains including the bi-lobed clam shell-like architectures of ATDs (R1/R2) and LBDs (D1/D2), the channel forming TMDs and linker peptides for both GluN1b and GluN2B subunits ( Figures 1 and S1 ). The ATDs and LBDs are assembled as a dimer of the GluN1b-GluN2B heterodimers ( Figure 1 B; orange and black dashes) whereas the TMDs are assembled as a 1b-2B-1b-2B hetero-tetramer with pseudo-4-fold symmetry with the channel gate formed by the GluN1b-M3 and GluN2B-M3′ helices. Importantly, 3D classification showed three major structures with distinct conformations, which we named “Non-active1,” “Non-active2,” and “Active,” with particle distributions of approximately 41%, 40.5%, and 18.5%, respectively ( Figure S1 ). The major differences among these 3D classes are the following: (1) subunit arrangement within the GluN1b-GluN2B ATD heterodimers, which can be represented by the distance between GluN1b Lys178 and GluN2B Asn184 in the R2 lobes (α4′-α5 distance) ( Figure 1 D); (2) relative orientation of the two GluN1b-GluN2B LBD heterodimers, which can be represented by the distance between GluN1b Arg510 in loop1 (L1′) and GluN2B Leu425 in loop2 (L2) in the D1 lobes (L1′-L2 distance) ( Figure 1 D); and (3) the relative tension of the LBD-M3′ linker of the GluN2B subunits, which directly affects the channel gate and can be measured by the distance between the two GluN2B Gln662 residues from the two GluN2B subunits ( Figure 1 E). Based on the above criteria, the three 3D classes were extensively compared to one another ( Figure 2 ). Moving from the “Non-active1” to the “Non-active2” conformation, the GluN2B ATD clam shell opens by ∼5° but otherwise the structures share similar subunit arrangements in the ATDs ( Figure 2 A), LBDs ( Figure 2 B), and TMD, with a closed channel gate ( Figures 2 C and 2D). In the “Active” conformation, each pair of the GluN1b-GluN2B ATD heterodimers rotate by ∼9° compared with those in “Non-active1” caused by reorientation of GluN2B ATD with respect to GluN1b ATD ( Figure 2 A). This is subsequently translated to a “rolling up” motion of the GluN1b-GluN2B LBD heterodimers ( Figure 2 B). This “Active” conformation can be trapped by inter-GluN1b-GluN2B subunit cross-linking at either the ATD or LBD by engineered disulfide bonds (“Active-SS”) or by methanethiosulfonate crosslinks designed on the basis of our previous low resolution structure, and they both result in upregulation of ion channel activity ( Esmenjaud et al., 2019 17. Esmenjaud, J.B. ∙ Stroebel, D. ∙ Chan, K. ... An inter-dimer allosteric switch controls NMDA receptor activity EMBO J. 2019; 38 :e99894 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tajima et al., 2016 59. Tajima, N. ∙ Karakas, E. ∙ Grant, T. ... Activation of NMDA receptors and the mechanism of inhibition by ifenprodil Nature. 2016; 534 :63-68 Crossref Scopus (169) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The cryo-EM density for the “Active” class was weaker especially at the LBD-TMD linker region because of small particle numbers than the other classes. To overcome this issue, we conducted single particle cryo-EM on the aforementioned mutant construct, “Active-SS,” harboring the GluN1b-Glu719Cys and GluN2B-Leu795Cys mutations ( Esmenjaud et al., 2019 17. Esmenjaud, J.B. ∙ Stroebel, D. ∙ Chan, K. ... An inter-dimer allosteric switch controls NMDA receptor activity EMBO J. 2019; 38 :e99894 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ) at the dimer of the GluN1b-GluN2B heterodimers interface in the LBD-layer ( Figure 2 B, red dashed circle in “Active-SS”; Table S1 ). This mutant was previously shown to increase equilibrium open probability by 2.5-fold with significant rise in mean open time ( Esmenjaud et al., 2019 17. Esmenjaud, J.B. ∙ Stroebel, D. ∙ Chan, K. ... An inter-dimer allosteric switch controls NMDA receptor activity EMBO J. 2019; 38 :e99894 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ) likely by stabilizing the conformation similar to the “Active” class above. Imaging of the “Active-SS” sample required usage of gold-coated holey grids, because they had a higher tendency to adhere to a carbon layer than the wild-type (WT) samples. Although the particle orientation for the WT samples was dominated by side views that for the “Active-SS” sample equally contained both top and side views ( Figure S2 ). Nevertheless, our single particle analysis shows an increased population of a 3D class similar in conformation to the “Active” 3D class but with an increase in resolution from 4.4 Å to 3.6 Å and improved cryo-EM density ( Figure S2 ). In this structure, the subunit rotation of 11° in the ATD is more pronounced than the “Active” conformation ( Figure 2 A), which is coupled to the “rolling up” of the GluN1b-GluN2B LBD heterodimers ( Figure 2 B) and pulling of the LBD-M3′ linkers from the GluN2B subunits to opposite directions ( Figures 2 C and 2D). Consequently, GluN2B-Ile655 from the two GluN2B subunits at the channel gate is pulled apart to open the gate ( Figures 2 D and S3 ; Video S1 ). The extent of gate opening is similar to that observed in the “Pre-open” state of the GluA2 AMPA receptor complexed to glutamate and cone snail toxins ( Chen et al., 2014 8. Chen, L. ∙ Dürr, K.L. ∙ Gouaux, E. X-ray structures of AMPA receptor-cone snail toxin complexes illuminate activation mechanism Science. 2014; 345 :1021-1026 Crossref Scopus (97) PubMed Google Scholar ) but is not as open as agonist bound GluA2 AMPA receptors complexes with the auxiliary subunit Stargazin ( Chen et al., 2017 9. Chen, S. ∙ Zhao, Y. ∙ Wang, Y. ...

Channel opening and gating mechanism in AMPA-subtype glutamate receptors Nature. 2017; 549 :60-65 Crossref Scopus (165) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures S3 C–S3F). As in GluA2 AMPA receptors, the movement in GluN1b subunits (equivalent to the A/C subunits; Figure S3 ) is not as robust as for the GluN2B subunits (equivalent to the B/D subunits; Figure S3 ) and does not appear to be strongly coupled to channel gating.

One of the distinct functional features of NMDAR pharmacology is that binding of either a GluN1-specific glycine antagonist or a GluN2-specific glutamate antagonist is sufficient for full inhibition of the channel activity even when agonists occupy the other subunits ( Figures 3 A–3B). However, how binding of the GluN1- or GluN2-targeting antagonist results in a similar pattern of channel inhibition remains largely unknown. Here, we attempted to resolve this long standing question by using the GluN1-targeting L689,560 and the GluN2-targeting SDZ-220-040 ligands ( Figure 3 A), which competitively inhibit activities of the WT channel as well as the CTD truncated channel used in the cryo-EM studies, as assessed by the two-electrode voltage clamp (TEVC) electrophysiology ( Figure 3 B; Table S2 ). These antagonists have higher potency ( Table S2 ) than classic antagonists including DCKA and D-AP5 ( Figure 3 A) where reported K i values on GluN1-GluN2A NMDARs are 80 nM and 0.71 μM, respectively ( Chen et al., 2008 7. Chen, P.E. ∙ Geballe, M.T. ∙ Katz, E. ... Modulation of glycine potency in rat recombinant NMDA receptors containing chimeric NR2A/2D subunits expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes J. Physiol. 2008; 586 :227-245 Crossref Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ; Jespersen et al., 2014 26. Jespersen, A. ∙ Tajima, N. ∙ Fernandez-Cuervo, G. ... Structural insights into competitive antagonism in NMDA receptors Neuron. 2014; 81 :366-378 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, we sought to reveal the binding modes to explain the high potency of both L689,560 and SDZ-220-040. Furthermore, high occupancy of binding sites with the high-affinity ligands limit plausible conformational variability caused by partial occupancy thereby facilitating single particle cryo-EM. Toward our goal, we first resolved the precise chemistry of antagonist binding and the pattern of conformational changes within the LBDs by obtaining X-ray crystallographic structures of the isolated GluN1-GluN2A LBD heterodimers bound to glycine and SDZ-220-040 (2.3 Å) and to L689,560 and glutamate (2.1 Å) ( Figures 3 C–3H; Table S3 ). We used the GluN1-GluN2A LBD heterodimers instead of the GluN1-GluN2B LBDs as the tool to obtain high-resolution crystal structures because of technical difficulties in crystallization of the GluN1-GluN2B LBDs proteins. Nevertheless, the GluN2A and GluN2B LBDs have 82%-90% identity-similarity in their primary sequences and are different only by one residue within the agonist/antagonist-binding pockets, thus, structural insights gained in the GluN2A LBD can be applied to study the GluN2B LBD. The subunit arrangement of the isolated GluN1-GluN2A LBD assembly is nearly identical to that of the two GluN1b-GluN2B LBD heterodimers in the intact ion channel where the majority of subunit interactions are mediated at the upper lobe (D1) of the bi-lobe structures ( Figures 3 C and 3F) with ligands bound to the inter-D1-D2 clefts in each LBD. The binding of L659,560 “opens” the GluN1b LBD clam shell by ∼28° compared with that of the glycine-bound structure (PDB: 4NF8 ) ( Figure 3 D) whereas the binding of SDZ-220-040 “opens” the GluN2A LBD bi-lobe by ∼23° compared with that of the glutamate-bound structure (PDB: 4NF8 ) ( Figure 3 G). The electron density for L659,560, SDZ-220-040, and surrounding residues is of sufficient quality to pinpoint key receptor-ligand interactions ( Figures 3 E and 3H). Binding of L659,560 to GluN1 involves the following interactions ( Figure 3 E): (1) polar interactions (2-carboxyl group/GluN1b-Arg544 and carbonyl group/GluN1b-Ser709); (2) hydrophobic interactions (aminophenyl group/GluN1b-Trp752 and -Val705); (3) halogen-pi interactions (7′-chloro group/GluN1b-Phe429 and 5-chloro group/GluN1b-Trp752); and (4) stacking interaction (quinoline backbone/GluN1b-Phe505). Binding of SDZ-220-040 to GluN2A involves the following interactions ( Figure 3 H): (1) polar interactions (phosphono group/GluN2A-Ser689, -Thr690, and -Tyr730, and amino propanoic group/GluN2A-Arg518, -Thr513, and -Ser511); (2) hydrophobic interactions (bi-phenyl rings/GluN2A-His485, -Tyr730, and -Val713; and (3) halogen-carboxylate interaction (2′-chloro group/GluN2A-Glu413). The information gained from the high-resolution crystal structures above served as excellent models to interpret the cryo-EM density of the antagonists in the context of cryo-EM structures for full length receptors.
In order to understand how conformational changes observed in the LBDs are represented in the context of the heterotetrameric channel, we obtained cryo-EM structures of intact GluN1-GluN2B NMDARs in the following three conditions: (1) SDZ-220-040 and glycine (Gly/SDZ); (2) L689,560 and glutamate (L689/Glu); and (3) L689,560 and SDZ-220-040 (L689/SDZ).
The Gly/SDZ structures have a major 3D class with C2 symmetry accounting for ∼80% of the population and another class with no symmetry but similar to the C2 class. Hence, the comparative analyses are done on the major 3D class (class 1) ( Figure S4 ; Table S1 ) against the “Active-SS” structure bound to glycine and glutamate. The Gly/SDZ structure is obtained at 3.6 Å overall resolution as assessed by FSC and shows clear density for SDZ-220-040 ( Figures 4 A, 4C, and S4 , cyan surface and mesh). The binding of SDZ-220-040 resulted in opening of the bi-lobe structure of the GluN2B LBD by ∼24° compared with that of the glutamate-bound GluN2B LBD in the “Active-SS” structure ( Figure 4 B), which is similar to that observed in the crystal structure of the GluN1-GluN2A LBDs (∼23°) ( Figure 3 G). The GluN1b LBD bi-lobes in Gly/SDZ and “Active-SS” are equally closed consistent with binding of glycine in both complexes. The overall conformation of the Gly/SDZ complex is similar to that of the “Active-SS” structure in that the GluN1b-GluN2B ATD subunit orientation is nearly identical (represented by the similar α4′-α5 distance) ( Figure 4 D), which as a consequence, stabilizes the “rolled up” LBD dimers (as measured by the L1-L2 distance) ( Figure 4 E). Thus, the only difference between the Gly/SDZ and the “Active-SS” structures is in the extent of bi-lobe opening in the GluN2B LBD. The ∼24° opening of the GluN2B LBD in the Gly/SDZ results in “loosening” of the GluN2B LBD-M3′ linker represented by the reduced distances between the GluN2B Gln662 Cαs compared with that of the “Active-SS” conformation (49.6 Å in Gly/SDZ and 61.0 Å in “Active-SS” ( Figure 4 F). Therefore, the mechanism of inhibition by the GluN2-specific antagonist SDZ-220-040, is to relieve the “tension” of the GluN2B LBD-M3′ linker, which uncouples the TMD channel from the extracellular domain. Consequently, the hydrophobic gate residues remain tightly associated with each other to “lock” the gate closed ( Video S2 ).

Conformational Change between “Active-SS” and “Gly/SDZ,” Related to Figure 4
To understand the mechanism of inhibition mediated by GluN1-antagonists, we explored the structure of the GluN1b-GluN2B NMDAR in complex with L689,560 and glutamate (L689/Glu). The single particle analysis resulted in two major 3D classes, both with C2 symmetry, which are similar to each other ( Figure S5 ; Table S1 ). The resolution of the L689/Glu structure at 4 Å is not as high as for Gly/SDZ, but is sufficient to confirm the presence of cryo-EM density representing L689,560 ( Figures 5 A and 5C). In the GluN2B LBD, glutamate was not fully resolved, however, the “closed” clam shell is consistent with the binding of glutamate. By contrast, the GluN1b LBD bi-lobes in all 3D classes are “open” compared to the glycine-bound GluN1b LBDs in the “Active-SS” and other glutamate-bound GluN2B structures reported in the current study by ∼12°–15° ( Figure 5 B). Notably, the extent of opening is significantly less than that observed in the crystal structure of the L689/Glu-bound GluN1-GluN2A LBD at ∼28° ( Figure 3 D). This difference in domain opening likely stems from steric hindrance associated with the packing pattern of the GluN1-GluN2B heterotetramer where the “mouth” of the GluN1 LBD clam shell is in the vicinity of the GluN2B LBD of the other heterodimer. That is, opening of the GluN1b LBDs as much as ∼28° would result in steric collision with the neighboring GluN2B LBD, especially around helices E and G of the GluN1b subunit and helices K′ and I′ of the GluN2B subunit ( Figure 5 E). Although the extent of bi-lobe opening is different between our cryo-EM structure of the intact GluN1b-GluN2B NMDARs and crystal structure of the isolated LBDs, the binding modes of L689,560 are similar to each other ( Figures S6 A and S6B). The greater extent of opening in our crystal structure results from movement of regions that are distant from the L689,560 binding site ( Figure S6 C), which in the intact heterotetrameric NMDARs would be restricted. This case is different from the previous study on a Drosophila glutamate receptor where two distinct modes of D-AP5 binding resulted in different extent of domain opening in its LBD ( Li et al., 2016 37. Li, Y. ∙ Dharkar, P. ∙ Han, T.H. ... Novel Functional Properties of Drosophila CNS Glutamate Receptors Neuron. 2016; 92 :1036-1048 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ). Most importantly, unlike the Gly/SDZ complex, the L689/Glu structure has an overall conformation and subunit arrangement distinct from the agonist-bound “Active-SS” state ( Figures 5 D–5F) but similar to the agonist-bound “Non-active1” structure ( Figures 5 G–5I). Compared to “Active-SS,” the GluN2B ATDs and the GluN1b-GluN2B LBD heterodimers in L689/Glu are “rolling up” ( Figure 5 D) and “rolling down” ( Figure 5 E), respectively. The L1′-L2 distances in the D1 lobes of the LBDs and the α4′-α5 distance in the R2 lobes of the ATDs between L689/Glu and “Active-SS” are distinct as result ( Figures 5 D–5E). In contrast, there is little or no difference in the ATD and LBD subunit arrangement between L689/Glu and “Non-active1” as indicated by the similar α4′-α5 and L1′-L2 distances between the L689/Glu and “Non-active1” ( Figures 5 G and 5H). Also similar to “Non-active1,” the GluN2B ATD clam shells in the L689/Glu structure have a “closed” conformation ( Figures 5 D and 5G) ∼9°–15° more closed compared with in the “Active-SS” structure, and the GluN1b-GluN2B LBD heterodimers are “rolling down” compared with those in “Active-SS” ( Figure 5 E); therefore, sufficient tension in the GluN2B LBD-M3′ linkers cannot be generated to open the channel gate ( Figures 5 F and 5I). Despite changes in the conformation of the GluN1b LBD, the arrangement of the GluN1b LBD-M3 linkers are similar between the “Active-SS,” the “Non-active1” and the L689/Glu structures ( Figures 5 F and 5I). Overall, our structural analysis shows that GluN1-targeting antagonists such as L689,560 inhibit channel activity by opening the GluN1 LBD clam shell and reorienting the GluN1 and GluN2B subunits to stabilize a “Non-active1”-like conformation, which results in a closed channel gate ( Video S3 ).

Conformational Change between “Active-SS” and “L689/Glu,” Related to Figure 5
Prior cryo-EM studies on Xenopus laevis NMDARs reported structures obtained in the presence of the GluN1- and GluN2-antagonists, DCKA and D-AP5, which display robust dissociation of inter-subunit interactions in the ATD and LBD layers of the receptor ( Zhu et al., 2016 75. Zhu, S. ∙ Stein, R.A. ∙ Yoshioka, C. ... Mechanism of NMDA Receptor Inhibition and Activation Cell. 2016; 165 :704-714 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (158) PubMed Google Scholar ). In structures of the L689/Glu or the Gly/SDZ complexes reported here, we do not observe such changes; thus, we wondered if the binding of antagonists to both the GluN1 and GluN2 subunits could induce the large conformational change seen in prior studies. We solved the structure of the GluN1b-GluN2B NMDAR in complex with L689,560 and SDZ-220-040 (L689/SDZ) at ∼4 Å resolution ( Figure S7 ; Table S1 ), which clearly showed density for both L689,560 and SDZ-220-040 ( Figures 6 A–6C and S7 ). Importantly, the GluN1 and GluN2B subunits remained associated with each other with no disruption of ATD and LBD dimer of dimer assemblies. In this structure, the GluN1 LBD clam shells are open by ∼12°–15° ( Figure 6 B) similar to the L689/Glu structure but different from the crystal structure of the isolated GluN1-GluN2A LBDs (∼28°) ( Figure 3 D) as in the case of L689/Glu again indicating that domain opening of the GluN1b LBD clam shell in the intact GluN1-GluN2B heterotetramer is restricted by steric hindrance. Domain opening of the GluN2B LBD clam shell is nearly identical to that observed in the both the Gly/SDZ structure and the GluN1-GluN2A LBD crystal structure ( Figures 3 G and 6 B). Further structural inspection revealed that subunit arrangement in the L689/SDZ structure is similar to that of the “Active-SS” structure, represented by similarities in the α4′-α5 distance in the R2 lobes of the ATDs ( Figure 6 D) and in the L1′-L2 distances in the D1 lobe of the LBDs ( Figure 6 E), as in the case of Gly/SDZ ( Figure 4 ). However, the “open” GluN2B LBD relaxes the LBD-M3′ linker to disengage conformational signals from the LBD to the channel similar to the Gly/SDZ complex ( Figure 6 F). A major difference between the L689/SDZ and the Gly/SDZ structures is that the L689/SDZ-bound structure has the LBD-M4′ linkers positioned closer to the “middle” of the heterotetramer above the gate, which results in further stabilization of the hydrophobic gate by formation of extra hydrophobic interaction between GluN2B-Val808 and the hydrophobic gate residues (GluN1b-Val677, -Leu678, and GluN2B-Ile655) ( Figure 6 G). Thus, binding of antagonists to both GluN1 and GluN2B stabilizes a “super” closed gate ( Video S4 ).

Conformational Change between “Active-SS” and “L689/SDZ,” Related to Figure 6

Section: Discussion

Inter-subunit and -domain rearrangement is the lynchpin of functional transitions in NMDARs; therefore, precise monitoring of conformational changes in multiple domains of the GluN1-GluN2 hetero-tetramer is essential for mechanistic understanding and reagent development. Here, we unraveled detailed functional mechanisms by solving high-resolution cryo-EM structures of GluN1b-GluN2B NMDARs in multiple distinct ligand bound forms. Our study reveals structural features that were not clearly visible in prior studies, including the LBD-TMD linker region, the channel gate, and ligand densities, and thus provides precise and detailed insights.
First, we showed that after agonist binding, NMDARs populate three major conformational states we name “Non-active1,” “Non-active2,” and “Active,” that differ from each other in their patterns of inter-GluN1b-GluN2B and inter-ATD-LBD orientations ( Figure 2 ). The relatively scarce population of the “Active” state is consistent with the previous single channel analyses, which estimated the open probability to be around 20% ( Banke et al., 2005 4. Banke, T.G. ∙ Dravid, S.M. ∙ Traynelis, S.F. Protons trap NR1/NR2B NMDA receptors in a nonconducting state J. Neurosci. 2005; 25 :42-51 Crossref Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ; Banke and Traynelis, 2003 3. Banke, T.G. ∙ Traynelis, S.F. Activation of NR1/NR2B NMDA receptors Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6 :144-152 Crossref Scopus (185) PubMed Google Scholar ). Disulfide-based conformational trapping of the “Active” conformation (“Active-SS”) increased the “Active” state population as assessed by 3D classification and resulted in a higher quality structure that facilitated our assessment of channel gating in comparison with the “Non-active1” and the “Non-active2” conformations.
In the “Active-SS” conformation, the LBD-M3′ linkers of the two GluN2B subunits are “stretched,” creating tension that perturbs the closed channel gate formed by a cluster of hydrophobic residues at the tip of the GluN1b-M3 and GluN2B-M3′ helices ( Figures 2 C–2D). Furthermore, the GluN1b and GluN2B ATDs orient themselves to close the gap between their R2 lobes ( Figure 2 A). In both the “Non-active1” and “Non-active2” states, the GluN2B LBD-M3′ linkers are too “relaxed” to perturb the channel gate; this is reflected by the fact that the two GluN1b-GluN2B LBD heterodimers are “rolled down” ( Figure 2 B) and the R2 lobes of the GluN1b and GluN2B ATDs are far apart ( Figure 2 A). The above patterns of concerted ATD-LBD movements are not observed in the activation process of AMPA receptors ( Chen et al., 2017 9. Chen, S. ∙ Zhao, Y. ∙ Wang, Y. ...

Channel opening and gating mechanism in AMPA-subtype glutamate receptors Nature. 2017; 549 :60-65 Crossref Scopus (165) PubMed Google Scholar ), indicating that the gating mechanism is distinct in NMDARs. Previous single channel recording and kinetic analyses indicated that binding of glycine and glutamate puts NMDARs in a multiple closed and open channel states as well as desensitized states ( Amico-Ruvio and Popescu, 2010 2. Amico-Ruvio, S.A. ∙ Popescu, G.K. Stationary gating of GluN1/GluN2B receptors in intact membrane patches Biophys. J. 2010; 98 :1160-1169 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ; Iacobucci and Popescu, 2018 24. Iacobucci, G.J. ∙ Popescu, G.K.

Maneshi, M.M. ∙ Maki, B. ∙ Gnanasambandam, R. ... Mechanical stress activates NMDA receptors in the absence of agonists Sci. Rep. 2017; 7 :39610 Crossref Scopus (59) PubMed Google Scholar ). Whether the “Non-active1” or the “Non-active 2” conformations represent desensitized states or non-desensitized states with a closed channel remains an open question at this point.
The channel gate of the “Active-SS” state is open to a similar extent to the “Pre-open” state of the GluA2 AMPA receptor complexed to cone snail toxin ( Chen et al., 2014 8. Chen, L. ∙ Dürr, K.L. ∙ Gouaux, E. X-ray structures of AMPA receptor-cone snail toxin complexes illuminate activation mechanism Science. 2014; 345 :1021-1026 Crossref Scopus (97) PubMed Google Scholar ) but less open than observed for GluA2 complex with Stargazin where the end of its M3 helices in the B/D subunits (equivalent to GluN2B subunits) are kinked ( Twomey et al., 2017 62. Twomey, E.C. ∙ Yelshanskaya, M.V. ∙ Grassucci, R.A. ... Channel opening and gating mechanism in AMPA-subtype glutamate receptors Nature. 2017; 549 :60-65 Crossref Scopus (165) PubMed Google Scholar ). This indicates that an additional conformational change in the channel gate might occur also for NMDARs. Capturing such a conformation by cryo-EM might require a stabilizer of the “open” channel state equivalent to Stargazin in AMPA receptors. Thus far, several auxiliary subunit proteins for NMDARs have been reported ( Ng et al., 2009 45. Ng, D. ∙ Pitcher, G.M. ∙ Szilard, R.K. ... Neto1 is a novel CUB-domain NMDA receptor-interacting protein required for synaptic plasticity and learning PLoS Biol. 2009; 7 :e41 Crossref Scopus (147) PubMed Google Scholar ; Scanlon et al., 2017 55. Scanlon, D.P. ∙ Bah, A. ∙ Krzeminski, M. ... An evolutionary switch in ND2 enables Src kinase regulation of NMDA receptors Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :15220 Crossref Scopus (10) PubMed Google Scholar ), however, none of them has been shown to alter ion channel gating. Nevertheless, the activation scheme of NMDARs has similar features to that for GluA2 AMPA receptors in that it is dominated by the movement of the LBD-M3′ linkers of the GluN2B subunits, which are equivalent to the B/D subunits in GluA2 AMPA receptors. Likewise, movement of the LBD-M3 linkers of the GluN1b subunits, which are equivalent to the A/C subunits in GluA2 AMPA receptors, is much smaller for both receptor classes. The above observations are also consistent with a previous study showing that perturbation of the GluN2A LBD-M3′ linker by mutation or insertion of Gly residues dramatically reduces the open probability and duration of channel opening ( Fedele et al., 2018 18. Fedele, L. ∙ Newcombe, J. ∙ Topf, M. ... Disease-associated missense mutations in GluN2B subunit alter NMDA receptor ligand binding and ion channel properties Nat.

Neurosci. 2018; 11 :113 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our “Active-SS” structure shows that this insertion site is the middle of helix E′ of GluN2B at the tip of the GluN2B LBD-M3′ linker; thus, it likely deforms the structure of the helix E′ region and “relaxes” the tension of the GluN2B LBD-M3′ linker in a dramatic fashion.
Next, by obtaining cryo-EM structures of two agonist/antagonist combinations, Gly/SDZ and L689/Glu, we demonstrated that GluN1 and GluN2 antagonists inhibit receptor activation by “relaxing” the GluN2B LBD-M3′ linkers in a similar way, however, via two distinct mechanisms. In both structures, the binding of antagonists stabilizes open-cleft conformations of LBDs consistent with previous structural studies ( Furukawa and Gouaux, 2003 19. Furukawa, H. ∙ Gouaux, E.

Conformational transitions in the glycine-bound GluN1 NMDA receptor LBD via single-molecule FRET Biophys. J. 2015; 109 :66-75 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the Gly/SDZ complex, the arrangement of GluN1b-GluN2B LBD heterodimers is similar to that of the “Active-SS” state where the GluN1b-GluN2B LBD heterodimers are “rolled up” and the R2 lobes of the GluN1b-GluN2B ATDs are close to each other. However, in the Gly/SDZ complex, unlike the agonist bound “Active-SS” state, binding of SDZ-220-040 opens the GluN2B LBD bi-lobe, which in turn relaxes the GluN2B LBD-M3′ linkers to favor a closed channel gate ( Figure 7 ). In the reverse situation, where a GluN1-antagonst, L689,560, and glutamate are bound (L689/Glu), the GluN2B LBD-M3′ linkers become “relaxed” as a result of the receptor entering into the “Non-active1”-like conformation where the heterodimers are “rolled down” ( Figures 5 and 7 ). Furthermore, in the L689/Glu complex, the GluN2B ATD bi-lobe closes even more extensively than observed in the “Non-active1” structure, to a similar extent found in the ifenprodil- or zinc-bound GluN2B ATD structures ( Karakas et al., 2009 29. Karakas, E. ∙ Simorowski, N. ∙ Furukawa, H.

Regan, M.C. ∙ Zhu, Z. ∙ Yuan, H. ... Structural elements of a pH-sensitive inhibitor binding site in NMDA receptors Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :321 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ) indicating tight coupling between ATD and LBD in NMDARs. That is, conformations of ATDs can be controlled from the LBDs and vice versa. Our finding here is likely applicable to the action of other antagonists including DCKA and D-AP5 because they are known to elicit similar opening of the LBD bi-lobe structures ( Furukawa and Gouaux, 2003 19. Furukawa, H. ∙ Gouaux, E.

Last, we showed that concurrent binding of GluN1- and GluN2-targeting antagonists (L689/SDZ) “relaxes” the GluN2B LBD-M3′ linkers by opening the GluN2B LBD bi-lobes in a similar manner to the “Gly/SDZ” complex. Here, the ATDs and LBDs have the “Active-SS”-like conformation as found in the “Gly/SDZ” complex. Another important feature of our study is that the “L689/SDZ” structure clearly shows tightly associated subunits and domains, which is similar to the observation in GluA2 AMPA receptor where the subunits in the homotetrameric assembly remain intact in its antagonist-bound and apo states ( Dürr et al., 2014 14. Dürr, K.L. ∙ Chen, L. ∙ Stein, R.A. ...

USA. 2013; 110 :5921-5926 Crossref Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sobolevsky et al., 2009 57. Sobolevsky, A.I. ∙ Rosconi, M.P. ∙ Gouaux, E. X-ray structure, symmetry and mechanism of an AMPA-subtype glutamate receptor Nature. 2009; 462 :745-756 Crossref Scopus (856) PubMed Google Scholar ). These observations in iGluRs are in parallel with the recent study on the Cys-loop family where antagonist-bound and apo-state structures resemble each other ( Yu et al., 2019 71. Yu, J. ∙ Zhu, H. ∙ Lape, R. ... Mechanism of gating and partial agonist action in the glycine receptor bioRxiv. 2019; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). The previous cryo-EM structure of Xenopus laevis GluN1-GluN2B NMDARs obtained in the presence of the GluN1-antagonist, DCKA and the GluN2-antagonist, D-AP5 at 9-15 Å resolution showed robust subunit dissociation for both the ATD and LBD dimer of dimers assemblies ( Zhu et al., 2016 75. Zhu, S. ∙ Stein, R.A. ∙ Yoshioka, C. ... Mechanism of NMDA Receptor Inhibition and Activation Cell. 2016; 165 :704-714 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (158) PubMed Google Scholar ), which currently stands as an outlier. Although the conformation of Xenopus NMDAR proteins might be more susceptible to perturbation by the water-air interface in cryo-EM conditions, there are a number of additional potential factors that could account for the differences including usage of different detergent (e.g., lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol + dodecyl maltoside versus lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol + digitonin), and different pHs (pH 6.5 versus pH 7.5). In a more recent study at low pH and in the presence of a high zinc concentration, the GluN1-GluN2A NMDAR subunits also become splayed in the extracellular region ( Jalali-Yazdi et al., 2018 25. Jalali-Yazdi, F. ∙ Chowdhury, S. ∙ Yoshioka, C. ... Mechanisms for Zinc and Proton Inhibition of the GluN1/GluN2A NMDA Receptor Cell. 2018; 175 :1520-1532 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (77) PubMed Google Scholar ). The GluN1-GluN2B NMDAR ATDs bind both protons and zinc that allosterically inhibit the channel activity, thus, it is possible that the low pH condition (pH 6.5) applied to the antagonist-bound Xenopus laevis NMDARs might have facilitated subunit dissociation. In our current study, we alleviated the conformational of ATD contributing to allosteric inhibition by removing ambient zinc by EDTA and by using physiological pH at 7.5. Our study demonstrated that the tight coupling between ATDs and LBDs play crucial roles in both activation and competitive inhibition by ligands that bind LBDs. It is interesting to note that auto-immune antibodies against NMDARs including the ones produced in Lupus ( Chan et al., 2020 6. Chan, K. ∙ Nestor, J. ∙ Huerta, T.S. ... Lupus autoantibodies act as positive allosteric modulators at GluN2A-containing NMDA receptors and impair spatial memory Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :1403 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ; DeGiorgio et al., 2001 13. DeGiorgio, L.A. ∙ Konstantinov, K.N. ∙ Lee, S.C. ...

Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antibodies, cognitive dysfunction, and depression in systemic lupus erythematosus Arthritis Rheum. 2006; 54 :2505-2514 Crossref Scopus (234) PubMed Google Scholar ) and anti-NMDAR encephalitis ( Dalmau et al., 2008 12. Dalmau, J. ∙ Gleichman, A.J. ∙ Hughes, E.G. ... Anti-NMDA-receptor encephalitis: case series and analysis of the effects of antibodies Lancet Neurol. 2008; 7 :1091-1098 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2475) PubMed Google Scholar ) bind ATDs to alter the ion channel functions further indicating the tight coupling between ATDs, LBDs, and TMDs. On the other hand, reagents that are designed to control an equilibrium of the conformational transitions observed in this study would be useful in fine-tuning NMDAR functions for therapeutic purposes.

Sf 9 cells were cultured in HyClone CCM3 cell culture medium (GE Healthcare) at 27°. Xenopus laevis oocytes used in electrophysiology experiments were cultured in 50% HyClone Leibovitz L-15 Medium at 18°C.
The expression and purification methods of intact NMDAR receptors were adopted from those established previously ( Tajima et al., 2016 59. Tajima, N. ∙ Karakas, E. ∙ Grant, T. ... Activation of NMDA receptors and the mechanism of inhibition by ifenprodil Nature. 2016; 534 :63-68 Crossref Scopus (169) PubMed Google Scholar ) except that the newly constructed vectors, pFp10_hsp and pUCp10_hsp, harboring sequences for the hr1 and hr5 enhancers, the Drosophila melanogaster HSP70 promoter, and the p10 3′UTR, were used for baculovirus production. Sf 9 insect cells at 4 × 10 6 cells/ml were infected with the recombinant baculovirus harboring both GluN1b and GluN2B (C-terminal truncation) and harvested after 48 hours. The membrane fractions (100 mg/ml) of the infected cells were solubilized in the buffer containing 20mM HEPES-Na pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM Glycine, 1 mM Na-Glutamate, and 0.5% LMNG for 2 hours at 4°C and centrifuged at 125,000 g for 40 minutes. The supernatant was purified using Strep-tactin resin followed by Superose 6 Increase column (GE Healthcare) size exclusion chromatography (SEC) with pre-equilibrated with 20 mM HEPES-Na pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.002% LMNG 1 mM glycine, 1 mM Na-glutamate. For antagonist-bound structures, all of the purification steps above were conducted in the absence of glycine and glutamate.
The protein samples were vitrified on glow discharged C-flat 1.2/1.3 Cu 400 mesh holey carbon grids (Protochips) or UltrAufoil holey gold film grids (Quantifoil) (for ‘Active-SS’) using FEI Vitrobot Mark IV at 15°C and at 85% humidity with a blot time of 4 s under level 7 blot force. The filter papers were washed with 1 mM EDTA and water and dried before usage. All the micrographs were acquired by Titan Krios (FEI) at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory operating at 300 kV and the GATAN K2 Summit direct electron detector couple with the GIF quantum energy filter (Gatan Inc.) at 105k magnification (1.37 Å/pixel), with the defocus range of −1.5 to −3.0 μm, and over 50 frames and 15 s exposure totaling the dose of 68 e/Å 2 . Automated data collection was conducted using the software, SerialEM ( Mastronarde, 2005 41. Mastronarde, D.N. Automated electron microscope tomography using robust prediction of specimen movements J. Struct. Biol. 2005; 152 :36-51 Crossref Scopus (3088) PubMed Google Scholar ).The movies alignment, CTF estimation, and particle picking were done using the program WARP ( Tegunov and Cramer, 2019 60. Tegunov, D. ∙ Cramer, P. Real-time cryo-electron microscopy data preprocessing with Warp Nat. Methods. 2019; 16 :1146-1152 Crossref Scopus (524) PubMed Google Scholar ). The picked particle images were subjected to two to three rounds of 2D classifications to remove ‘junk’ particles. The selected particles are subjected to ab-initio 3D map generation, which are then refined and 3D classified into seven to eight classes without imposing symmetry. 3D classes were inspected using UCSF Chimera ( Oshima et al., 2016 47. Oshima, A. ∙ Tani, K. ∙ Fujiyoshi, Y. Atomic structure of the innexin-6 gap junction channel determined by cryo-EM Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 :13681 Crossref Scopus (80) PubMed Google Scholar ) and particles from similar 3D classes were merged and further refined and classified. 3D classes that do not contain density for TMDs were excluded from further refinement. If the 3D classes looked symmetrical, C2 symmetry was imposed. At this point, CTF refinement was applied to selected classes followed by another round of 3D refinement. 2D classification, ab-initio 3D map generation, 3D refinement, 3D classification, per particle CTF refinement and B-factor sharpening were done using the program cisTEM ( Grant et al., 2018 22. Grant, T. ∙ Rohou, A. ∙ Grigorieff, N. cis TEM, user-friendly software for single-particle image processing eLife. 2018; 7 :e35383 Crossref Scopus (554) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Model building was done initially by docking our previous cryo-EM structure (PDB code: 5FXH ) into the B-factor sharpened cryo-EM density maps using UCSF Chimera ( Oshima et al., 2016 47. Oshima, A. ∙ Tani, K. ∙ Fujiyoshi, Y. Atomic structure of the innexin-6 gap junction channel determined by cryo-EM Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 :13681 Crossref Scopus (80) PubMed Google Scholar ) then remodeled using Rosetta 3.7 ( Wang et al., 2016 66. Wang, R.Y. ∙ Song, Y. ∙ Barad, B.A. ... Automated structure refinement of macromolecular assemblies from cryo-EM maps using Rosetta eLife. 2016; 5 :e17219 Crossref Scopus (272) PubMed Google Scholar ). The resulting models were manually inspected and modified to fit into the density using COOT ( Emsley et al., 2010 16. Emsley, P. ∙ Lohkamp, B. ∙ Scott, W.G. ... Features and development of Coot Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :486-501 Crossref Scopus (19617) PubMed Google Scholar ). For the areas where the map was poorly resolved, poly-alanine models were introduced to replace the actual primary sequences. The final models were refined against the cryo-EM maps using Phenix real space refinement ( Adams et al., 2010 1. Adams, P.D. ∙ Afonine, P.V. ∙ Bunkóczi, G. ... PHENIX: a comprehensive Python-based system for macromolecular structure solution Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :213-221 Crossref Scopus (18121) PubMed Google Scholar ) with secondary structure and Ramachandran restraints. The FSCs were calculated by phenix.mtriage. Summary of data collection and refinement statistics are shown in Table S1 .
cRNA encoding GluN1-4b and GluN2B or GluN1-4bΔCTD and GluN2BΔCTD NMDARs were injected into defolliculated Xenopus laevis oocytes (0.05–0.3 ng total cRNA per oocyte). The oocytes were incubated in recovery medium (50% L-15 medium (Hyclone) buffered by 15mM Na-HEPES at a final pH of 7.4), supplemented with 100 μg mL −1 streptomycin, and 100 U mL −1 penicillin at 18°C. Two electrode voltage clamp (TEVC; Axoclamp-2B) recording was performed between 48 and 96 hours after injection using an extracellular solution containing 5 mM HEPES, 100 mM NaCl, 0.3 mM BaCl 2 , 10mM Tricine at final pH 7.4 (adjusted with KOH). The current was measured using agarose-tipped microelectrode (0.4–1.0 MΩ) at the holding potential of − 60 mV. Maximal response currents were evoked by 100 μM of glycine and L-glutamate. Data was acquired by the program Pulse (HEKA) and analyzed by Origin 8 (OriginLab Corp).
The isolated LBD proteins for rat GluN1 and rat GluN2A were obtained using our previously published method ( Jespersen et al., 2014 26. Jespersen, A. ∙ Tajima, N. ∙ Fernandez-Cuervo, G. ... Structural insights into competitive antagonism in NMDA receptors Neuron. 2014; 81 :366-378 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar ). The purified GluN1 and GluN2A LBD proteins were separately concentrated to 6 mg/mL, mixed in at a 1:1 weight ratio, and dialyzed against 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.0), 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM glycine, and 1 mM glutamate. The GluN1-GluN2A LBD proteins were crystallized using hanging-drop vapor diffusion at 18°C for two to three days where reservoir solutions contained 100 mM HEPES (pH 7.0), 60-90 mM NaCl, and 15%–20% polyethylene glycol monomethylether 2000 (PEG2000 MME). The crystals were then sequentially soaked against the crystallization buffer containing 1 −100 μM SDZ-220-040 or L689,560. The crystals were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen in the crystallization buffer supplemented with the antagonist of interest and 18% glycerol. X-ray diffraction data was collected at the ID-23-B beamline of the Advanced Photon System at Argonne National Laboratory and processed using HKL2000 ( Otwinowski and Minor, 1997 48. Otwinowski, Z. ∙ Minor, W. Processing of X-ray diffraction data collected in oscillation mode Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276 :307-326 Crossref Scopus (38990) PubMed Google Scholar ). The structures were determined by molecular replacement using the D1 and D2 domains of GluN1 and GluN2A LBDs (PDB code: 4NF8 ) as search probes. Molecular replacement, structural refinement and model building were performed using PHASER ( McCoy et al., 2007 43. McCoy, A.J. ∙ Grosse-Kunstleve, R.W. ∙ Adams, P.D. ... Phaser crystallographic software J. Appl. Cryst. 2007; 40 :658-674 Crossref Scopus (15801) PubMed Google Scholar ), PHENIX ( Adams et al., 2010 1. Adams, P.D. ∙ Afonine, P.V. ∙ Bunkóczi, G. ... PHENIX: a comprehensive Python-based system for macromolecular structure solution Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :213-221 Crossref Scopus (18121) PubMed Google Scholar ), and Coot ( Emsley and Cowtan, 2004 15. Emsley, P. ∙ Cowtan, K. Coot: model-building tools for molecular graphics Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60 :2126-2132 Crossref Scopus (25035) PubMed Google Scholar ). The ligands were built in ChemDraw and CIF files were generated in the Grade server (Global Phasing Ltd). Summary of data collection and refinement statistics are shown in Table S3 .
Data processing and statistical analysis of electrophysiology data were conducted using the software Origin. The unpaired Student’s t test was implemented to compare K i values of antagonists on various receptor constructs. The n values in these experiments represent number of Xenopus oocytes from which electrophysiological recordings were conducted. The K i values are represented as mean ± SD. The information above is described in the figure legend of Figure 2 and in Table S2 . No method was applied to determine whether the data met assumptions of the statistical approach.
