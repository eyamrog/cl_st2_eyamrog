Title: Structures of Human Antibodies Bound to SARS-CoV-2 Spike Reveal Common Epitopes and Recurrent Features of Antibodies


Abstract: Summary

Neutralizing antibody responses to coronaviruses mainly target the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the trimeric spike. Here, we characterized polyclonal immunoglobulin Gs (IgGs) and Fabs from COVID-19 convalescent individuals for recognition of coronavirus spikes. Plasma IgGs differed in their focus on RBD epitopes, recognition of alpha- and beta-coronaviruses, and contributions of avidity to increased binding/neutralization of IgGs over Fabs. Using electron microscopy, we examined specificities of polyclonal plasma Fabs, revealing recognition of both S1 A and RBD epitopes on SARS-CoV-2 spike. Moreover, a 3.4 Å cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of a neutralizing monoclonal Fab-spike complex revealed an epitope that blocks ACE2 receptor binding. Modeling based on these structures suggested different potentials for inter-spike crosslinking by IgGs on viruses, and characterized IgGs would not be affected by identified SARS-CoV-2 spike mutations. Overall, our studies structurally define a recurrent anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody class derived from VH3-53/VH3-66 and similarity to a SARS-CoV VH3-30 antibody, providing criteria for evaluating vaccine-elicited antibodies.

Section: Introduction

A newly emergent betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, resulted in a pandemic in 2020, causing the respiratory disease COVID-19 ( Wu et al., 2020b 89. Wu, F. ∙ Zhao, S. ∙ Yu, B. ... A new coronavirus associated with human respiratory disease in China Nature. 2020; 579 :265-269 Crossref Scopus (7709) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhou et al., 2020 97.

SARS-CoV-2 is the third zoonotic betacoronavirus to infect humans this century, following SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome) infections in 2003 and 2012, respectively ( de Wit et al., 2016 11. de Wit, E. ∙ van Doremalen, N. ∙ Falzarano, D. ... SARS and MERS: recent insights into emerging coronaviruses Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2016; 14 :523-534 Crossref Scopus (2426) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, four globally distributed human coronaviruses, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 (betacoronaviruses), and HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E (alphacoronaviruses), contribute to 15%–30% of common colds ( Fung and Liu, 2019 15. Fung, T.S. ∙ Liu, D.X. Human Coronavirus: Host-Pathogen Interaction Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2019; 73 :529-557 Crossref Scopus (655) PubMed Google Scholar ).The neutralizing antibody response to coronaviruses is primarily directed against the trimeric spike glycoprotein (S) on the viral membrane envelope, which serves as the machinery to fuse the viral and host cell membranes ( Fung and Liu, 2019 15. Fung, T.S. ∙ Liu, D.X. Human Coronavirus: Host-Pathogen Interaction Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2019; 73 :529-557 Crossref Scopus (655) PubMed Google Scholar ). Coronavirus S proteins contain three copies of an S1 subunit comprising the S1 A through S1 D domains, which mediates attachment to target cells, and three copies of an S2 subunit, which contains the fusion peptide and functions in membrane fusion ( Figure 1 A). Neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV S proteins often target the receptor-binding domain (RBD; also called the S1 B domain) ( Hwang et al., 2006 26.

The S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 (1,273 residues, strain Wuhan-Hu-1) and SARS-CoV (1,255 residues, strain Urbani) share 77.5% amino acid sequence identity, while the S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV (1,353 residues, strain EMC2012) are more distantly related, sharing only 31% identity ( Figures 1 B and 1C). Sequence identities between SARS-CoV-2 and common cold coronavirus S proteins are even lower, varying between 25% and 30%. Phylogenetic analyses confirm that SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV are more closely related to each other than to other human coronaviruses ( Figure 1 B). The RBD/S1 B domains show varying degrees of sequence identity, ranging from 13% (SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-NL63) to 74% (SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV). Nevertheless, the 3D structures of S protein trimer ectodomains are similar to each other and to other coronavirus S structures, including the finding of flexible RBDs (S1 B domains) that can be in various “up” conformations or in the “down” conformation of the closed pre-fusion trimer ( Kirchdoerfer et al., 2016 31.

Primary amino acid sequence differences in the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV compared with MERS-CoV ( Figures 1 B and 1C) result in binding to different host receptors: angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV ( Hoffmann et al., 2020 25.

One of the common cold coronaviruses, HCoV-NL63, also uses its RBD (S1 B ) to bind ACE2, although its interactions differ structurally from RBD-ACE2 interactions of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV ( Tortorici and Veesler, 2019 74. Tortorici, M.A. ∙ Veesler, D. Structural insights into coronavirus entry Adv. Virus Res. 2019; 105 :93-116 Crossref Scopus (550) PubMed Google Scholar ), whereas HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 uses their S1 A domains to bind host receptors including 9- O -acetylated sialic acids ( Tortorici et al., 2019 75. Tortorici, M.A. ∙ Walls, A.C. ∙ Lang, Y. ... Structural basis for human coronavirus attachment to sialic acid receptors Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2019; 26 :481-489 Crossref Scopus (399) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Understanding the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 S protein is of critical importance because correlates of protection for vaccines usually involve antibodies ( Plotkin, 2001 50. Plotkin, S.A. Immunologic correlates of protection induced by vaccination Pediatr. Infect. Dis. J. 2001; 20 :63-75 Crossref Scopus (205) PubMed Google Scholar , 2008 51. Plotkin, S.A.

Correlates of protection induced by vaccination Clin. Vaccine Immunol. 2010; 17 :1055-1065 Crossref Scopus (1231) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, antibodies are being considered as therapeutics for COVID-19 patients ( Zhou and Zhao, 2020 96. Zhou, G. ∙ Zhao, Q. Perspectives on therapeutic neutralizing antibodies against the Novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 Int. J. Biol. Sci. 2020; 16 :1718-1723 Crossref Scopus (203) PubMed Google Scholar ). Relatively little is known about antibody recognition of SARS-CoV-2 S compared with other coronavirus S proteins ( Graham et al., 2013 17. Graham, R.L. ∙ Donaldson, E.F. ∙ Baric, R.S. A decade after SARS: strategies for controlling emerging coronaviruses Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2013; 11 :836-848 Crossref Scopus (529) PubMed Google Scholar ; Gralinski and Baric, 2015 18.

However, structures of S trimer, RBD-Fab, RBD-ACE2, and S trimer-Fab complexes for SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses are informative for interpreting and understanding the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 ( Gui et al., 2017 20.

A highly conserved cryptic epitope in the receptor binding domains of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV Science. 2020; 368 :630-633 Crossref Scopus (1030) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Here, we analyzed purified IgG and Fabs from the plasmas of 10 COVID-19 convalescent individuals ( Robbiani et al., 2020 60. Robbiani, D.F. ∙ Gaebler, C. ∙ Muecksch, F. ... Convergent antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in convalescent Individuals Nature. 2020; Epub ahead of print Crossref Scopus (1262) PubMed Google Scholar ) for binding to trimeric S and monomeric RBD/S1 B domains of six human coronaviruses and for neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses. To better understand recognition by polyclonal antibodies, we further characterized plasma Fabs from two individuals using negative-stain electron microscopy polyclonal epitope mapping (nsEMPEM), showing that the polyclonal landscape includes antibodies that target epitopes in both SARS-CoV-2 S1 A and RBD domains. In addition, we solved a 3.4 Å single-particle cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of an S trimer bound to a neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb), which targeted an epitope on an “up” RBD that overlapped with the RBD epitope identified by nsEMPEM and would sterically block ACE2 receptor binding. The epitopes we found represent binding classes defined by distinct VH gene segments, suggesting that these recurring classes are commonly represented in neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and providing criteria for evaluating neutralizing antibodies raised by infection or vaccination. Finally, we used modeling to suggest that distinct binding orientations allow for differential avidity effects, demonstrating the potential for inter-spike crosslinking that would increase effective affinities for some anti-S immunoglobulin Gs (IgGs) on SARS-CoV-2 virions.

Section: Results

Convalescent plasma samples were collected from individuals who had recovered from COVID-19 at Rockefeller University Hospital ( Robbiani et al., 2020 60. Robbiani, D.F. ∙ Gaebler, C. ∙ Muecksch, F. ... Convergent antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in convalescent Individuals Nature. 2020; Epub ahead of print Crossref Scopus (1262) PubMed Google Scholar ). We isolated polyclonal IgGs from 10 convalescent plasmas ( Figure 2 ), most of which had relatively high neutralizing titers ( Robbiani et al., 2020 60. Robbiani, D.F. ∙ Gaebler, C. ∙ Muecksch, F. ... Convergent antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in convalescent Individuals Nature. 2020; Epub ahead of print Crossref Scopus (1262) PubMed Google Scholar ), and compared binding of their IgGs to purified S proteins from SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-229E ( Figure S1 ) by ELISA ( Figures 3 and S2 ). Purified plasma IgGs recognized S proteins from all coronaviruses evaluated, with weaker binding observed for most samples to MERS-CoV ( Figure 3 C) and common cold coronavirus S proteins ( Figures 3 D–3F). Among the plasmas (COV21, COV57, and COV107) chosen for further analysis based on ELISA EC 50 values and neutralization potencies ( Robbiani et al., 2020 60. Robbiani, D.F. ∙ Gaebler, C. ∙ Muecksch, F. ... Convergent antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in convalescent Individuals Nature. 2020; Epub ahead of print Crossref Scopus (1262) PubMed Google Scholar ), IgGs from COV21 and COV57 showed the strongest binding to the S proteins from SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, with only the COV57 IgGs showing measurable binding to MERS-CoV S protein. The COV107 IgGs showed intermediate binding to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV and no binding to MERS-CoV S proteins ( Figures 3 A–3C).
ELISAs against RBD (or S1 B domain for two of the common cold coronavirus S proteins) showed the strongest binding to SARS-CoV-2 RBD for COV21, followed by COV57 and then COV107 IgGs, with the proportion of RBD versus S binding from COV21, COV72, and COV47 suggesting that the majority of the IgG responses from these plasmas were focused on the RBD, often a target of neutralizing antibodies in coronavirus infections ( Hwang et al., 2006 26.

Cryo-EM structure of the 2019-nCoV spike in the prefusion conformation Science. 2020; 367 :1260-1263 Crossref Scopus (95) PubMed Google Scholar ). The only appreciable reactivity with SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV RBDs was exhibited by COV21 IgG, which bound to SARS-CoV RBD ( Figure 3 B). Although we cannot determine whether the same IgGs are binding all three S proteins, the potential for cross-reactive binding of SARS-CoV antibodies was demonstrated for a mAb that was isolated from a SARS-infected individual, which was shown to recognize SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs ( Pinto et al., 2020 49. Pinto, D. ∙ Park, Y.J. ∙ Beltramello, M. ... Cross-neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 by a human monoclonal SARS-CoV antibody Nature. 2020; Epub ahead of print Crossref Scopus (1209) PubMed Google Scholar ). No reactivity with MERS-CoV RBD was observed for any of the polyclonal IgGs ( Figure 3 C). For most of the plasma IgGs, binding to the RBD was substantially weaker than binding to the counterpart S protein, with the exception of the strong COV21 and COV72 responses to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Most of the plasma IgGs exhibited stronger binding to the common cold S1 B /RBDs than to the counterpart S protein trimers ( Figures 3 D–3F).
To assess the degree to which cross-reactive recognition contributed to binding of plasma IgGs to RBD/S1 B domains, we repeated the ELISAs before and after adsorption with SARS-CoV-2 RBD-coupled resin or a control resin for five plasma IgG samples ( Figure S3 ). As a positive control, purified plasma IgGs incubated with the RBD resin showed little or no SARS-CoV-2 RBD binding ( Figure S3 A). Binding to SARS-CoV RBD was also reduced for the IgGs remaining after SARS-CoV-2 RBD adsorption ( Figure S3 B), suggesting cross-reactive recognition consistent with the 78% sequence conservation and structural homology of SARS-CoV-2 RBD and SARS-CoV RBD ( Walls et al., 2020 79. Walls, A.C. ∙ Park, Y.J. ∙ Tortorici, M.A. ... Structure, Function, and Antigenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein Cell. 2020; 181 :281-292 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (5954) PubMed Google Scholar ). By contrast, adsorption of plasma IgGs with SARS-CoV-2 RBD resins had only a modest effect on binding to common cold coronavirus RBDs ( Figures S3 D–S3F), consistent with little to no cross-reactive antibody recognition, likely due to the low conservation between the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and mild coronavirus RBDs ( Premkumar et al., 2020 54. Premkumar, L. ∙ Segovia-Chumbez, B. ∙ Jadi, R. ... The receptor binding domain of the viral spike protein is an immunodominant and highly specific target of antibodies in SARS-CoV-2 patients Sci Immunol. 2020; 5 :eabc8413 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ). We also note that IgGs from control plasmas collected from individuals not exposed to SARS-CoV-2 exhibited binding to common cold coronavirus RBDs that was not affected by SARS-CoV-2 RBD adsorption ( Figure S3 ), again consistent with pre-exposure to mild coronaviruses rather than cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV-2 RBD.
Taken together, these results suggest: (1) The binding strengths and patterns of different coronavirus S protein recognition were diverse across COVID-19 individual plasma samples, (2) convalescent COVID-19 individuals harbor antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, and to a lesser extent, the RBD/S1 B , as well as reactivity to other coronaviruses, which likely represents previous exposure to common cold viruses, (3) polyclonal IgGs from individual plasma samples that bind to S proteins from MERS-CoV and/or SARS-CoV may display cross-reactive recognition, because the plasma donors were unlikely to have been infected with either of these coronaviruses, and (4) compared to the COV57 and COV107 plasmas, the COV21 IgG response had a higher proportion of IgGs that recognized the SARS-CoV-2 RBD.
We further evaluated the degree to which avidity effects contributed to the strength of binding of plasma IgGs to S proteins and RBDs by comparing the binding of bivalent polyclonal IgGs to binding of monovalent Fabs prepared by proteolytic cleavage of purified polyclonal IgGs ( Figures 2 A–2C). Differential effects were evident in IgG to Fab comparisons: most of the SARS-CoV-2 anti-S response was reduced by at least 50% in the case of monovalent Fabs for all plasmas except for COV57 ( Figure 3 A). Recognition of the other coronavirus S proteins was also diminished for Fabs compared to intact IgGs ( Figures 3 B–3F). For the three plasma IgGs that were further evaluated, the largest relative differences in IgG versus Fab binding to SARS-CoV-2 S protein was observed for COV21 and COV107; the IgG versus Fab binding difference for COV57 was less pronounced ( Figure 3 A). Notably, the SARS-CoV-2 S protein and RBD ELISAs showed that a higher fraction of the COV21 plasma IgGs were RBD-specific compared with the COV57 IgGs ( Figures 3 A and 3B) ( Robbiani et al., 2020 60. Robbiani, D.F. ∙ Gaebler, C. ∙ Muecksch, F. ... Convergent antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in convalescent Individuals Nature. 2020; Epub ahead of print Crossref Scopus (1262) PubMed Google Scholar ).
In summary, the ELISA data indicate that IgGs in plasma samples differ in their degree of focus upon epitopes within the S protein RBD/S1 B domain, their relative amounts of reactivity with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and common cold coronaviruses and the extent to which avidity effects contribute to the tighter binding of polyclonal bivalent IgGs as compared with monovalent Fabs.
To investigate whether the bivalent architecture or larger size of IgGs compared with Fabs resulted in increased neutralization potencies, we measured the potencies of purified plasma IgGs and Fabs using in vitro neutralization assays ( Figure 3 G). SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses were constructed as described ( Robbiani et al., 2020 60. Robbiani, D.F. ∙ Gaebler, C. ∙ Muecksch, F. ... Convergent antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in convalescent Individuals Nature. 2020; Epub ahead of print Crossref Scopus (1262) PubMed Google Scholar ), and the concentrations of IgGs and Fabs at which 50% neutralization was achieved (IC 50 values) were calculated. All tested plasma IgGs neutralized pseudoviruses at lower molar concentrations than their Fab counterparts, with increased potencies ranging from 6- to 100-fold ( Figure 3 H). The increased potency of the IgGs compared to Fabs was statistically significant (p = 0.0003), even when accounting for two Fabs per IgG. We conclude that bivalent IgGs more effectively neutralize SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses than monovalent Fabs.
We next used negative stain polyclonal electron microscopy (nsEMPEM) ( Bianchi et al., 2018 3. Bianchi, M. ∙ Turner, H.L. ∙ Nogal, B. ...

In this method, Fabs that bind to an antigenic target are separated from non-binding Fabs in a polyclonal mixture by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), Fab-antigen complexes are imaged by EM, and 2D/3D classification are used to identify predominant epitopes ( Bianchi et al., 2018 3. Bianchi, M. ∙ Turner, H.L. ∙ Nogal, B. ... Electron-Microscopy-Based Epitope Mapping Defines Specificities of Polyclonal Antibodies Elicited during HIV-1 BG505 Envelope Trimer Immunization Immunity. 2018; 49 :288-300 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (127) PubMed Google Scholar ; Nogal et al., 2020 44.

Typically, Fabs are incubated at 1,000–2,000× above EC 50 values calculated from binding assays ( Bianchi et al., 2018 3. Bianchi, M. ∙ Turner, H.L. ∙ Nogal, B. ... Electron-Microscopy-Based Epitope Mapping Defines Specificities of Polyclonal Antibodies Elicited during HIV-1 BG505 Envelope Trimer Immunization Immunity. 2018; 49 :288-300 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (127) PubMed Google Scholar ; Nogal et al., 2020 44.

Mapping Polyclonal Antibody Responses in Non-human Primates Vaccinated with HIV Env Trimer Subunit Vaccines Cell Rep. 2020; 30 :3755-3765 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ). For most COVID-19 plasmas, Anti-S Fab EC 50 values were estimated to be >50 μg/mL ( Figure S2 ). Purified polyclonal Fabs from COV21 and COV57 plasmas, which had approximate EC 50 s ranging from 20–50 μg/mL, showed stable binding by SEC after incubation with SARS-CoV-2 S trimers ( Figure 2 D), and 2D class averages showed evidence of bound Fabs ( Figure S4 ). By contrast, purified Fabs from COV107 (EC 50 >50 μg/mL) showed no evidence of binding to S by SEC (data not shown) or in a 3D reconstruction ( Figure 4 A).
In order to verify that extra densities in nsEMPEM 3D reconstructions corresponded to bound Fab(s), we first solved a 3D reconstruction of SARS-CoV-2 S alone, revealing the expected low resolution structure of the closed, prefusion S trimer ( Figure 4 A). A 3D reconstruction of COV21 Fabs complexed with S showed recognizable density for the S trimer with a single extending density at the apex of the trimer corresponding to a Fab or mixture of Fabs bound to a similar epitope ( Figure 4 A). The density could be fit to an S trimer with a Fab bound to a single RBD in an “up” position using coordinates from SARS-CoV-2 S trimer structures ( Walls et al., 2020 79. Walls, A.C. ∙ Park, Y.J. ∙ Tortorici, M.A. ... Structure, Function, and Antigenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein Cell. 2020; 181 :281-292 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (5954) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wrapp et al., 2020 86. Wrapp, D. ∙ Wang, N. ∙ Corbett, K.S. ... Cryo-EM structure of the 2019-nCoV spike in the prefusion conformation Science. 2020; 367 :1260-1263 Crossref Scopus (95) PubMed Google Scholar ), consistent with ELISA results mapping the COV21 response to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD ( Figure 3 A). The complex structure and the position of the COV21 Fab(s) closely resembled a structure of SARS-CoV S bound to a Fab from the S230 mAb isolated from a SARS-CoV-infected individual, whose epitope overlaps with the binding site for the ACE2 receptor ( Walls et al., 2019 78. Walls, A.C. ∙ Xiong, X. ∙ Park, Y.J. ... Unexpected Receptor Functional Mimicry Elucidates Activation of Coronavirus Fusion Cell. 2019; 176 :1026-1039 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (411) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 4 B). Interestingly, S230 binding was shown to functionally mimic ACE2 binding, allowing cleavage of the SARS-CoV S protein to promote fusogenic conformational rearrangements ( Walls et al., 2019 78. Walls, A.C. ∙ Xiong, X. ∙ Park, Y.J. ... Unexpected Receptor Functional Mimicry Elucidates Activation of Coronavirus Fusion Cell. 2019; 176 :1026-1039 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (411) PubMed Google Scholar ). While the COV21 Fab complex reconstruction showed occupancy for one S-protomer with an RBD in an “up” position ( Figure 4 A), COV21 Fab(s) might also bind analogous to the S230 Fab-SARS-CoV S complex, where classes of S trimer structures were found with two “up”/one “down” and three “up” RBD conformations ( Walls et al., 2019 78. Walls, A.C. ∙ Xiong, X. ∙ Park, Y.J. ... Unexpected Receptor Functional Mimicry Elucidates Activation of Coronavirus Fusion Cell. 2019; 176 :1026-1039 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (411) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Moreover, antibody S230, who’s binding orientation resembles the position observed in the COV21 Fab(s) reconstruction ( Figure 4 B), appears to be a member of a class of recurrent anti-SARS mAbs. It belongs to a set of 10 non-clonally related VH3-30 -derived mAbs isolated from an individual infected with SARS-CoV, which represented 40% of the clones isolated from this individual ( Pinto et al., 2020 49. Pinto, D. ∙ Park, Y.J. ∙ Beltramello, M. ... Cross-neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 by a human monoclonal SARS-CoV antibody Nature. 2020; Epub ahead of print Crossref Scopus (1209) PubMed Google Scholar ). Notably, these clones contained similar 9 amino acid light chain complementarity determining 3 (CDRL3) sequences (consensus sequence MQGTHWPPT), suggesting that this group of mAbs has a common mode of binding, partially dependent on VH3-30 -derived features. RBD residues 473 and 475 contacted by the antibody heavy chain in the S230 Fab-SARS-CoV structure ( Walls et al., 2019 78. Walls, A.C. ∙ Xiong, X. ∙ Park, Y.J. ... Unexpected Receptor Functional Mimicry Elucidates Activation of Coronavirus Fusion Cell. 2019; 176 :1026-1039 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (411) PubMed Google Scholar ) are conserved between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and these residues are in the vicinity of antibody heavy chain residues N57 and K58. The only VH gene segments encoding the N57/K58 pair are VH3-30 , VH3-30-3 , and VH3-33 ( Lefranc et al., 2015 37. Lefranc, M.P. ∙ Giudicelli, V. ∙ Duroux, P. ... IMGT®, the international ImMunoGeneTics information system® 25 years on Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43 :D413-D422 Crossref Scopus (377) PubMed Google Scholar ). When mAbs were isolated after single B cell sorting using SARS-CoV-2 RBD as a bait, COV21 antibodies included heavy chains derived from IGHV3-30 , which were also found in sequenced antibodies from five other donor plasmas ( Robbiani et al., 2020 60. Robbiani, D.F. ∙ Gaebler, C. ∙ Muecksch, F. ... Convergent antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in convalescent Individuals Nature. 2020; Epub ahead of print Crossref Scopus (1262) PubMed Google Scholar ). The similarity in binding orientation of COV21 Fab(s) with S230 ( Figure 4 B) suggests that COV21 Fab(s) may be members of the S230 recurrent class. Consistent with this hypothesis, 38 of 127 sequenced antibodies from the COV21 donor were derived from VH3-30 or from the closely related VH3-30-3 or VH3-33 VH gene segments ( Robbiani et al., 2020 60. Robbiani, D.F. ∙ Gaebler, C. ∙ Muecksch, F. ... Convergent antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in convalescent Individuals Nature. 2020; Epub ahead of print Crossref Scopus (1262) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The COV57 Fab(s)-S structure also showed recognizable density for both the S trimer and a single bound Fab(s) ( Figure 4 C). However, in this complex, the S trimer appeared closed with no RBDs in an “up” position, and the Fab density was not associated with an RBD, but rather with one of the S1 A subunits. In the complex, the Fab(s) pointed downward (i.e., toward the viral membrane) rather that upward (away from the viral membrane), as seen for the COV21 Fab(s). The COV57 Fab(s) density was in the vicinity of loops on the S1 A domain that were disordered in SARS-CoV-2 S trimer structures ( Walls et al., 2020 79. Walls, A.C. ∙ Park, Y.J. ∙ Tortorici, M.A. ... Structure, Function, and Antigenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein Cell. 2020; 181 :281-292 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (5954) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wrapp et al., 2020 86. Wrapp, D. ∙ Wang, N. ∙ Corbett, K.S. ... Cryo-EM structure of the 2019-nCoV spike in the prefusion conformation Science. 2020; 367 :1260-1263 Crossref Scopus (95) PubMed Google Scholar ). Such flexibility could explain the diffuse nature of the COV57 Fab(s) density in this reconstruction. Interestingly, characterization of COV57 neutralization showed less correlation with RBD-specific antibodies relative to COV21 ( Robbiani et al., 2020 60. Robbiani, D.F. ∙ Gaebler, C. ∙ Muecksch, F. ... Convergent antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in convalescent Individuals Nature. 2020; Epub ahead of print Crossref Scopus (1262) PubMed Google Scholar ), consistent with the ELISAs ( Figure 3 A) and nsEMPEM characterizations ( Figure 4 C) reported here. This suggests that targeting S1 regions outside of the RBD may represent alternative modes for potent neutralization of SARS-CoV-2, as found for neutralizing antibodies isolated after vaccination against MERS-CoV in non-human primates ( Wang et al., 2015 81. Wang, L. ∙ Shi, W. ∙ Joyce, M.G. ... Evaluation of candidate vaccine approaches for MERS-CoV Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 :7712 Crossref Scopus (242) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Although we could not resolve densities for bound Fabs in the COV107-S nsEMPEM reconstruction ( Figure 4 A), RBD-binding mAbs isolated from the COV107 individual were potently neutralizing ( Robbiani et al., 2020 60. Robbiani, D.F. ∙ Gaebler, C. ∙ Muecksch, F. ... Convergent antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in convalescent Individuals Nature. 2020; Epub ahead of print Crossref Scopus (1262) PubMed Google Scholar ). We determined a 3.4 Å single-particle cryo-EM structure of the complex of one such antibody (C105; IC 50 for neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus = 26.1 ng/mL) ( Robbiani et al., 2020 60. Robbiani, D.F. ∙ Gaebler, C. ∙ Muecksch, F. ... Convergent antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in convalescent Individuals Nature. 2020; Epub ahead of print Crossref Scopus (1262) PubMed Google Scholar ) bound to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein using a 1.8 Å crystal structure of the unbound C105 Fab for fitting to the cryo-EM density ( Figures 5 , S5 , and S6 ; Tables S1 and S2 ).
We found two populations of C105 Fab-S complexes: an asymmetric S trimer with two “up” RBDs, each of which was complexed with a Fab (state 1; 3.4 Å resolution), and a symmetric trimer with three RBDs in the same “up” conformation, again with each RBD complexed with a Fab (state 2; 3.7 Å resolution) ( Figure 5 A). A subset of complexes in the cryo-EM structure of the S230 mAb bound to SARS-CoV S trimer were also found with three “up” RBDs bound to three Fabs ( Walls et al., 2019 78. Walls, A.C. ∙ Xiong, X. ∙ Park, Y.J. ... Unexpected Receptor Functional Mimicry Elucidates Activation of Coronavirus Fusion Cell. 2019; 176 :1026-1039 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (411) PubMed Google Scholar ), although in that structure, as in the C105-S structure, the majority of complexes had their RBDs in a two “up,” one “down” configuration.
The C105-RBD interfaces were similar across the five examples in the state 1 and state 2 complex structures ( Figure S5 ), thus we describe the interface for one of the Fab-RBD complexes in the state 1 complex in which the resolution at the interface was improved by performing a focused, local refinement ( Punjani et al., 2017 56. Punjani, A. ∙ Rubinstein, J.L. ∙ Fleet, D.J. ... cryoSPARC: algorithms for rapid unsupervised cryo-EM structure determination Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :290-296 Crossref Scopus (3666) PubMed Google Scholar ) on the C105 Fab-RBD portion of the complex ( Figure S5 ). The C105 Fab uses its three heavy chain complementarity determining regions (CDRH1, CDRH2, and CDRH3) and two of its light chain CDRs (CDRL1 and CDRL3) to rest against the receptor-binding ridge of the RBD ( Figures 5 B and 5C). The majority of the antibody contacts are made by CDRH1, CDRH2, and CDRL1, with CDRH3 and CDRL3 playing minor roles. The C105 epitope overlaps with the COV21 epitope defined by nsEMPEM, which also rests against the receptor-binding ridge in the RBD, although the Fab(s) in the COV21 reconstruction are predicted to adopt a different angle of approach ( Figure 5 D). Interestingly, the C105-RBD interaction closely resembles the RBD interaction of another COVID-19 donor-derived neutralizing mAb, B38 ( Figure 5 E), as reported in a recent Fab-RBD crystal structure ( Wu et al., 2020c 90. Wu, Y. ∙ Wang, F. ∙ Shen, C. ... A noncompeting pair of human neutralizing antibodies block COVID-19 virus binding to its receptor ACE2 Science. 2020; 368 :1274-1278 Crossref Scopus (739) PubMed Google Scholar ). The heavy chains of both B38 and C105 are derived from the VH3-53 gene segment, whereas the light chain gene segments differ: KV1-9 for B38 ( Wu et al., 2020c 90. Wu, Y. ∙ Wang, F. ∙ Shen, C. ... A noncompeting pair of human neutralizing antibodies block COVID-19 virus binding to its receptor ACE2 Science. 2020; 368 :1274-1278 Crossref Scopus (739) PubMed Google Scholar ) and LV2-8 for C105 ( Robbiani et al., 2020 60. Robbiani, D.F. ∙ Gaebler, C. ∙ Muecksch, F. ... Convergent antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in convalescent Individuals Nature. 2020; Epub ahead of print Crossref Scopus (1262) PubMed Google Scholar ). Accordingly, the CDRH1 and CDRH2 loops of both neutralizing antibodies share similar conformations and contribute more to the antibody-RBD interface than their CDRH3 loops ( Figures 5 B and 5E).
The common epitope of C105 and B38 overlaps with the binding site for ACE2 ( Figure 5 F), rationalizing their potent neutralizing activities ( Robbiani et al., 2020 60. Robbiani, D.F. ∙ Gaebler, C. ∙ Muecksch, F. ... Convergent antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in convalescent Individuals Nature. 2020; Epub ahead of print Crossref Scopus (1262) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wu et al., 2020c 90. Wu, Y. ∙ Wang, F. ∙ Shen, C. ... A noncompeting pair of human neutralizing antibodies block COVID-19 virus binding to its receptor ACE2 Science. 2020; 368 :1274-1278 Crossref Scopus (739) PubMed Google Scholar ). Given that COV21 was one of the more potent neutralizing plasmas of the 149 that were collected ( Robbiani et al., 2020 60. Robbiani, D.F. ∙ Gaebler, C. ∙ Muecksch, F. ... Convergent antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in convalescent Individuals Nature. 2020; Epub ahead of print Crossref Scopus (1262) PubMed Google Scholar ), the overlap in the C105/B38 neutralizing epitope with the nsEMPEM-defined predominant COV21 epitope suggests that recognition of the COV21 epitope by S230-like antibodies would also be neutralizing.
The shared binding mode of C105 and B38, both VH3-53 -derived mAbs, defines a recurrent class of anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs. Among a large set (n = 534) of cloned anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs against the RBD, those derived from the VH3-53 and VH3-66 gene segments were over-represented ( Robbiani et al., 2020 60.

Convergent antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in convalescent Individuals Nature. 2020; Epub ahead of print Crossref Scopus (1262) PubMed Google Scholar ). Other studies have also reported anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs derived from these genes ( Brouwer et al., 2020 5. Brouwer, P.J.M. ∙ Caniels, T.G. ∙ van der Straten, K. ...

Rapid isolation and profiling of a diverse panel of human monoclonal antibodies targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). The VH3-53 and VH3-66 VH gene segments encode V regions that differ in only one amino acid position, which is not in a CDR. Thus, they are functionally equivalent in terms of V-gene-determined mAb classes. When grouping VH3-53 and VH3-66 , over-representation of VH3-53 / VH3-66 -derived mAbs is significant (p = 0.035). A notable characteristic of the VH3-53 / VH3-66 -derived subset (75 mAbs) within the 534 anti-RBD mAbs ( Robbiani et al., 2020 60. Robbiani, D.F. ∙ Gaebler, C. ∙ Muecksch, F. ... Convergent antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in convalescent Individuals Nature. 2020; Epub ahead of print Crossref Scopus (1262) PubMed Google Scholar ) was a bias toward shorter CDRH3s (as defined by IMGT) ( Lefranc et al., 2015 37. Lefranc, M.P. ∙ Giudicelli, V. ∙ Duroux, P. ... IMGT®, the international ImMunoGeneTics information system® 25 years on Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43 :D413-D422 Crossref Scopus (377) PubMed Google Scholar ): 75% had lengths between 9 and 12 residues, which is significantly different from the human antibody repertoire and from the entire set of 534 anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD mAbs (two sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, p = 0.017) ( Figure S7 A).
Superposition of VH domains from unrelated antibodies with longer CDRH3s suggests that RBD residues 456–457 and/or 484–493 present a steric barrier limiting the CDRH3 loop lengths that are compatible with this binding orientation ( Figure S7 B). A recent report identified a clonally unrelated group of VH3-53 / VH3-66 anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs based on CDRH3 sequence similarity to the anti-SARS-CoV mAb m396 (derived from VH1-69 ) ( Cao et al., 2020 6. Cao, Y. ∙ Su, B. ∙ Guo, X. ... Potent neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 identified by high-throughput single-cell sequencing of convalescent patients’ B cells Cell. 2020; 182 :1-12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (845) PubMed Google Scholar ). The structure of a SARS-CoV RDB complex with m396 (PDB: 2DD8 ) ( Prabakaran et al., 2006 53. Prabakaran, P. ∙ Gan, J. ∙ Feng, Y. ... Structure of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus receptor-binding domain complexed with neutralizing antibody J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281 :15829-15836 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (192) PubMed Google Scholar ) shows that mAb m396 does not share the B38/C105 binding mode. We suggest that the key feature of the VH3-53 / VH3-66 mAbs identified based on CDRH3 sequence similarity to m396 ( Cao et al., 2020 6. Cao, Y. ∙ Su, B. ∙ Guo, X. ... Potent neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 identified by high-throughput single-cell sequencing of convalescent patients’ B cells Cell. 2020; 182 :1-12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (845) PubMed Google Scholar ) is their CDRH3 length (11 residues), and these mAbs will share the C105/B38 binding mode, not the m396 binding mode.
A recent report suggested that a mutation in the S protein (D614G) increases transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 ( Korber et al., 2020 35. Korber, B. ∙ Fischer, W.M. ∙ Gnanakaran, S. ... Tracking changes in SARS-CoV-2 Spike: evidence that D614G increases infectivity of the COVID-19 virus. Cell. 2020; Epub ahead of print Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2715) PubMed Google Scholar ), and it has been speculated that this substitution, or others found in different S protein sequences, could affect antibody recognition. In cryo-EM structures of the prefusion S trimer ( Walls et al., 2020 79. Walls, A.C. ∙ Park, Y.J. ∙ Tortorici, M.A. ...

Cryo-EM structure of the 2019-nCoV spike in the prefusion conformation Science. 2020; 367 :1260-1263 Crossref Scopus (95) PubMed Google Scholar ) and in our C105-S complex ( Figure 5 ), S protein residue D614 is located in S1 D , where it makes contact with an adjacent protomer. To address whether the D614G mutation could affect binding of antibodies, we marked the location of the D614 residues and other residues that were reported to mutate ( Korber et al., 2020 35. Korber, B. ∙ Fischer, W.M. ∙ Gnanakaran, S. ... Tracking changes in SARS-CoV-2 Spike: evidence that D614G increases infectivity of the COVID-19 virus. Cell. 2020; Epub ahead of print Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2715) PubMed Google Scholar ) on the COV21 and COV57 nsEMPEM reconstructions ( Figures 6 A and 6B) and on the C105-S cryo-EM structure ( Figure 6 C). The RBD-binding COV21 Fab(s) and the C105 Fab are distant from residue D614 ( Figures 6 A and 6C). Therefore, if the COV21 reconstruction reflects the predominant epitope in the COV21 plasma, it is unlikely that antibodies elicited in the COV21 individual would be sensitive to the D614G substitution. Indeed, in the absence of large conformational changes, all anti-RBD antibodies, including C105 ( Robbiani et al., 2020 60. Robbiani, D.F. ∙ Gaebler, C. ∙ Muecksch, F. ...

A noncompeting pair of human neutralizing antibodies block COVID-19 virus binding to its receptor ACE2 Science. 2020; 368 :1274-1278 Crossref Scopus (739) PubMed Google Scholar ), would be unaffected by this substitution. Mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD identified by genome sequencing also include N439K, V483A, and V367F ( Tables S3 and S4 ), but the affected residues are not within the epitopes of the COV21 Fab(s) ( Figures 6 A and 6B) or the C105 Fab ( Figure 6 C), and residue 483 is disordered in unliganded S protein structures ( Walls et al., 2020 79.

The predominant epitope in the COV57 Fab(s) is closer to S protein D614, but this residue appears to be outside of the binding interface. In addition, mutations in the S1 A domain identified by genome sequencing ( Tables S3 and S4 ) reside outside of the COV57 Fab(s) epitope ( Figures 6 A and 6B). Thus, in the absence of major conformational changes induced by mutation, the observed substitutions, particularly the D614G mutation, are unlikely to affect antibodies elicited in the COV21 or COV57 individuals or in RBD-binding mAbs such as C105.
IgGs contain two identical antigen-binding Fabs, thus offering the opportunity to bind pathogens with regularly spaced antigenic sites using avidity effects, either through inter-spike crosslinking (binding the same epitope on adjacent spikes) and/or intra-spike crosslinking (binding the same epitope on identical subunits of a single multimeric spike) ( Klein and Bjorkman, 2010 34. Klein, J.S. ∙ Bjorkman, P.J. Few and far between: how HIV may be evading antibody avidity PLoS Pathog. 2010; 6 :e1000908 Crossref Scopus (196) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To address whether inter-spike crosslinking by anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgGs could occur, we modeled adjacent S proteins on a virion membrane assuming a minimum inter-spike separation distance of ∼15 nm, as observed from cryo-electron tomography analyses of SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses ( Neuman et al., 2011 42. Neuman, B.W. ∙ Kiss, G. ∙ Kunding, A.H. ... A structural analysis of M protein in coronavirus assembly and morphology J. Struct. Biol. 2011; 174 :11-22 Crossref Scopus (554) PubMed Google Scholar ). By including a bound Fab on each S trimer in the position of the COV21 Fab(s) from the nsEMPEM reconstruction, we addressed whether the Fabs from a single IgG could bind to two adjacent S trimers. The modeling predicts that inter-spike crosslinking could occur for the COV21 epitope ( Figure 7 A). By contrast, the downward-pointing Fab(s) in the COV57-S nsEMPEM reconstruction appear unlikely to participate in inter-spike crosslinking by an IgG due to the Fab orientations being unable to accommodate an Fc in a position that could join two Fabs ( Figure 7 A). These predictions are consistent with ELISA results demonstrating diminished binding for COV21 Fabs compared with their IgG counterparts, but less pronounced differences for the Fab versus IgG comparison for COV57 ( Figure 2 ).
We also used modeling to predict whether avidity effects could influence the interaction between ACE2, an integral membrane protein that dimerizes on the target cell surface ( Yan et al., 2020 93. Yan, R. ∙ Zhang, Y. ∙ Li, Y. ... Structural basis for the recognition of SARS-CoV-2 by full-length human ACE2 Science. 2020; 367 :1444-1448 Crossref Scopus (3568) PubMed Google Scholar ), with viral S trimers. Starting with a cryo-EM structure of dimeric full-length ACE2 associated with the integral membrane protein B 0 AT1 bound to monomeric SARS-CoV-2 RBDs ( Yan et al., 2020 93. Yan, R. ∙ Zhang, Y. ∙ Li, Y. ... Structural basis for the recognition of SARS-CoV-2 by full-length human ACE2 Science. 2020; 367 :1444-1448 Crossref Scopus (3568) PubMed Google Scholar ), we modeled bound S trimers from a cryo-EM structure of SARS-CoV S trimers with two RBDs in an “up” position ( Kirchdoerfer et al., 2018 32. Kirchdoerfer, R.N. ∙ Wang, N. ∙ Pallesen, J. ... Stabilized coronavirus spikes are resistant to conformational changes induced by receptor recognition or proteolysis Sci. Rep. 2018; 8 :15701 Crossref Scopus (314) PubMed Google Scholar ). Assuming there are adjacent ACE2-B 0 AT1 complexes in the host cell membrane, the modeling predicts that inter-spike crosslinking is possible ( Figure 7 B). In addition, intra-spike cross-linking could also occur if the RBDs in a two “up”/one “down” S trimer can each rotate ( Figure 7 C). Thus, if S trimers can indeed crosslink adjacent ACE2 receptors or bind as a single trimer to both ACE2 subunits in an ACE2 dimer, they could take advantage of avidity effects to bind more tightly than predicted from affinity measurements involving the interactions of monomeric ACE2 ectodomains to monomeric coronavirus RBDs ( Shang et al., 2020 70.

The possibility of avidity effects during the interactions of SARS-CoV-2 S with ACE2 dimers has implications for interpretation of pseudovirus assays to measure coronavirus infectivity in the presence and absence of potential inhibitors such as antibodies. In vitro neutralization assays for SARS-CoV-2 include pseudoviruses based on HIV lentiviral particles ( Chen et al., 2020 8. Chen, X. ∙ Li, R. ∙ Pan, Z. ...

Robust neutralization assay based on SARS-CoV-2 S-bearing vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudovirus and ACE2-overexpressed BHK21 cells bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). Each of these pseudovirus types could potentially incorporate different numbers of spikes, in which case the overall spike density would alter sensitivity to antibody avidity. In any case, the effects of avidity on IgG binding to a tethered antigen are a complicated mixture of intrinsic Fab-antigen affinity, kinetics, input concentration, and incubation time ( Klein and Bjorkman, 2010 34. Klein, J.S. ∙ Bjorkman, P.J. Few and far between: how HIV may be evading antibody avidity PLoS Pathog. 2010; 6 :e1000908 Crossref Scopus (196) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wu et al., 2005 87.

Biol. 2005; 350 :126-144 Crossref Scopus (191) PubMed Google Scholar ), thus neutralization potencies of some, but not all, IgGs could be affected in in vitro neutralization assays. In addition, when considering therapeutic applications of convalescent plasma or purified antibodies, avidity effects would be difficult to predict given uncertainties about antibody concentrations, viral titers, and potentially different S trimer spacings and densities on infectious virions.

Section: Discussion

Our results provide a glimpse into diverse antibody responses in neutralizing plasmas from donors who recovered from COVID-19. We characterized polyclonal plasma IgGs that exhibited different degrees of cross-reactive binding between S proteins from SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV and showed that the plasma IgGs also included non-cross-reactive antibodies against common cold virus RBDs. By mapping SARS-CoV-2 S epitopes targeted by convalescent plasma IgGs, we not only observed the expected targeting of the S protein RBD, but also discovered an S1 A epitope outside of the RBD, which may represent an alternative binding site for neutralizing antibodies. The RBD-binding Fab(s) from COV21 plasma resembled binding of S230, a VH3 - 30 mAb isolated from a SARS-CoV patient that blocks ACE2 receptor binding ( Rockx et al., 2008 61. Rockx, B. ∙ Corti, D. ∙ Donaldson, E. ... Structural basis for potent cross-neutralizing human monoclonal antibody protection against lethal human and zoonotic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus challenge J. Virol. 2008; 82 :3220-3235 Crossref Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We found another type of ACE2 receptor-blocking anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody in our analysis of a neutralizing mAb derived from the COV107 individual. In a 3.4Å cryo-EM structure of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein bound to the C105 mAb, we observed an epitope on the RBD that overlapped with the binding site for COV21 Fab(s) and closely resembled the binding of B38, another mAb isolated from a COVID-19 patient ( Wu et al., 2020c 90. Wu, Y. ∙ Wang, F. ∙ Shen, C. ... A noncompeting pair of human neutralizing antibodies block COVID-19 virus binding to its receptor ACE2 Science. 2020; 368 :1274-1278 Crossref Scopus (739) PubMed Google Scholar ). Like C105, B38 is also derived from the VH3 - 53 VH gene segment. Our structural studies support the hypothesis that recurrent classes of anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies derived from the VH3-53/VH3 - 66 and VH3 - 30 gene segments use the distinct RBD-binding modes of the B38/C105 and S230 mAbs, respectively, providing valuable information for evaluating antibodies raised by infection or vaccination by sequences alone. Finally, the RBD and S1 A epitopes we mapped by nsEMPEM and single-particle cryo-EM are unlikely to be affected by common mutations in different SARS-CoV-2 isolates, offering hope that antibody therapeutics and/or a vaccine might be effective in combatting the current pandemic.

HEK293T cells for pseudovirus production and HEK293T ACE2 cells for pseudovirus neutralization experiments were cultured at 37°C and 5% CO 2 in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, GIBCO) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS, Sigma-Aldrich) and 5 μg/ml Gentamicin (Sigma-Aldrich). The medium for the 293T Ace2 cells additionally contained 5μg/ml Blasticidin (GIBCO). For constitutive expression of ACE2 in 293T cells, a cDNA encoding ACE2, carrying two inactivating mutations in the catalytic site (H374N & H378N), was inserted into CSIB ( Kane et al., 2016 29. Kane, M. ∙ Zang, T.M. ∙ Rihn, S.J. ... Identification of Interferon-Stimulated Genes with Antiretroviral Activity Cell Host Microbe. 2016; 20 :392-405 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (163) PubMed Google Scholar ) 3′ to the SFFV promoter ( Robbiani et al., 2020 60.

Convergent antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in convalescent Individuals Nature. 2020; Epub ahead of print Crossref Scopus (1262) PubMed Google Scholar ). 293T ACE2 cells were generated by transduction with CSIB based virus followed by selection with 5 μg/ml Blasticidin (GIBCO). Expi293F cells (GIBCO) for protein expression were maintained at 37°C and 8% CO 2 in Expi293 Expression medium (GIBCO), transfected using Expi293 Expression System Kit (GIBCO) and maintained under shaking at 130 rpm. The gender of the HEK293T, HEK293T ACE2 and Expi293F cell lines is female. Cell lines were not specifically authenticated.
E. coli DH5 Alpha (Zymo Research) for propagation of expression plasmids were cultured at 37°C in LB broth (Sigma-Aldrich) with shaking at 250 rpm.
To generate pseudotyped viral stocks, HEK293T cells were transfected with pNL4-3ΔEnv-nanoluc and pSARS-CoV2-S trunc ( Robbiani et al., 2020 60. Robbiani, D.F. ∙ Gaebler, C. ∙ Muecksch, F. ... Convergent antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in convalescent Individuals Nature. 2020; Epub ahead of print Crossref Scopus (1262) PubMed Google Scholar ) using polyethylenimine, leading to production of HIV-1-based virions carrying the SARS-CoV-2 S protein at the surface. Eight hours after transfection, cells were washed twice with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and fresh media was added. Supernatants containing virions were harvested 48 hours post transfection, filtered and stored at −80°C. Infectivity of virions was determined by titration on 293T ACE2 cells.
Convalescent and healthy donor plasma samples were collected and processed as described ( Robbiani et al., 2020 60. Robbiani, D.F. ∙ Gaebler, C. ∙ Muecksch, F. ... Convergent antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in convalescent Individuals Nature. 2020; Epub ahead of print Crossref Scopus (1262) PubMed Google Scholar ). The convalescent plasma samples used for nsEMPEM were from residents in the State of New York: COV21 (a 54-year-old male Hispanic, collection 27 days after symptom onset), COV57 (a 66-year-old male Caucasian, collection 21 days after symptom onset), and COV107 (a 53-year-old female Caucasian, collection 29 days after symptom onset). An analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes in the GISAID database with sample collection dates in March 2020 (contemporaneous with the infections of individuals COV21, COV57, and COV107) was performed to identify any viral spike mutations likely to have been present. For SARS-CoV-2 genomes of New York State residents from March 2020, 468 of 475 contained the D614G mutation. Thus, based on state-level mutant frequencies, these individuals were likely to have been infected with D614G-containing viruses. All other spike mutations in these genomes had a frequency below 2%. All participants provided written informed consent before sample collection at the Rockefeller University Hospital and the study was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice. Anti-coagulated plasma was heat-inactivated (56°C for 1 hour) prior to shipment to Caltech and stored at 4°C thereafter ( Robbiani et al., 2020 60. Robbiani, D.F. ∙ Gaebler, C. ∙ Muecksch, F. ...

Briefly, the S ectodomain constructs included an N-terminal mu-phosphatase signal peptide, 2P stabilizing mutations ( Pallesen et al., 2017 46. Pallesen, J. ∙ Wang, N. ∙ Corbett, K.S. ... Immunogenicity and structures of a rationally designed prefusion MERS-CoV spike antigen Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :E7348-E7357 Crossref Scopus (691) PubMed Google Scholar ) and a C-terminal extension (GSG-RENLYFQG (TEV protease site), GGGSG-YIPEAPRDGQAYVRKDGEWVLLSTFL (foldon trimerization motif), G-HHHHHHHH (octa-histidine tag), and GLNDIFEAQKIEWHE (AviTag)). For SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-OC43 mutations to remove the S1/S2 furin cleavage site were introduced.
Codon-optimized nucleotide sequences encoding the receptor binding domain (RBD) for SARS-CoV-2 (residues 331-524) SARS-CoV S (residues 318-510), MERS-CoV S (residues 367-588), HCoV-NL63 (residues 481-614), and corresponding S1 B domains for HCoV-OC43 (residues 324-632), and HCoV-229E (residues 286-434) were synthesized and subcloned into the mammalian expression pTwist-CMV BetaGlobin vector by Twist Bioscience Technologies. The RBD/S1 B constructs included an N-terminal human IL-2 signal peptide and dual C-terminal tags (G-HHHHHHHH (octa-histidine), and GLNDIFEAQKIEWHE (AviTag)).
The S protein and RBD/S1 B constructs were expressed by transient transfection of Expi293F cells (GIBCO) and purified from clarified transfected cell supernatants four days post-transfection using HisTrap Fast Flow and HisTrap High Performance columns (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). After concentration, affinity-purified proteins were further purified by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) using a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200 pg column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) in 1x TBS (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.02% NaN 3 ). Peak fractions were analyzed by SDS- PAGE, and fractions corresponding to S trimers or monomeric RBD/S1 B proteins were pooled and stored at 4°C.
Purified CoV-S trimers were concentrated to 1 mg/mL and loaded onto a Superose 6 Increase 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) and passed through a Wyatt DAWN coupled to a Wyatt UT-rEX differential refractive index detector (Wyatt Technology). Data were analyzed using Astra 6 software (Wyatt Technology) to determine glycoprotein molecular weights.
IgGs were purified from plasma samples using 5-mL HiTrap MabSelect SuRe columns (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). Heat-inactivated plasma was diluted 10-fold with cold PBS, and samples were applied to prepacked columns at 1 mL/min. Bound IgGs were washed with 10 column volumes (CV) PBS and eluted with 5 CV 0.1M glycine, 100 mM NaCl, pH 3.0 directly into 10% v/v 1M Tris-HCl, pH 8. To produce polyclonal Fab fragments, IgGs were buffer exchanged into PBS by centrifugation with 30 kDa MWCO membrane centrifugal filter units (Millipore). Fabs were generated by papain digestion using crystallized papain (Sigma-Aldrich) in 50 mM sodium phosphate, 2 mM EDTA, 10 mM L-cysteine, pH 7.4 for 30-60 min at 37°C at a 1:100 enzyme:IgG ratio. To remove undigested IgGs and Fc fragments, digested products were applied to a 1-mL HiTrap MabSelect SuRe column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) and the flow-through containing cleaved Fabs was collected. Fabs were further purified by SEC using a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) in TBS, before concentrating and storage at 4°C.
To evaluate binding of purified polyclonal IgGs or Fabs to CoV proteins, purified S1 B /RBD or S proteins were biotinylated using the Biotin-Protein Ligase-BIRA kit according to manufacturer’s instructions (Avidity). Biotinylated-CoV proteins were captured on streptavidin coated 96-well plates (Thermo Scientific) by incubating with 100 μL of 2 μg/mL protein solution in TBS overnight at 4°C. Plates were washed 3x in washing buffer (1x TBST: 20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween20, pH 8.0) and blocked with 200 μL blocking buffer (TBST-MS: 1x TBST + 1% w/v milk, 1% v/v goat serum (GIBCO) for 1 h at RT. Immediately after blocking, polyclonal IgGs or Fabs were assayed for binding at a 50μg/mL starting concentration and seven 4-fold serial dilutions in blocking buffer. After 2 h incubation at RT, plates were washed 5 times with washing buffer and incubated with goat-anti-human IgG or goat-anti-human IgG(H+L) secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (SouthernBiotech) in blocking buffer at a 1:4000 or 1:2000 dilution, respectively. Plates were washed 5 times with washing buffer and developed by addition of 100μL 1-Step Ultra TMB-ELISA Substrate Solution (Thermo Scientific) for 3 min. The developing reaction was quenched by addition of 100μl 1N HCl and absorbance was measured at 450nm using Gen5 software on a Synergy Neo2 Reader (BioTek).
Plasmids for SARS-CoV-2 RBD 6xHisTag constructs (residues 319-541, GenBank: MN908947.3) were a gift from the lab of Florian Krammer (Mount Sinai). SARS-CoV-2 RBD 6xHisTag constructs were expressed by transient transfection of Expi293F cells (GIBCO) and purified using HisTrap FF and HisTrap HP columns (GE Healthcare Life Sciences), followed by SEC using a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200 pg column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) against 1x TBS (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.02% NaN 3 ). Purified protein was concentrated and buffer exchanged into 100 mM Sodium Bicarbonate pH 8.3, 500 mM NaCl using a gravity-flow chromatography with a PD-10 desalting column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). Buffer-exchanged RBD was concentrated to 5 mL and covalently coupled to a 5 mL HiTrap NHS-activated Sepharose column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Control resin was made using the same procedure to covalently couple 2G12, an HIV-1 mAb, as described ( Scharf et al., 2015 66. Scharf, L. ∙ Wang, H. ∙ Gao, H. ... Broadly Neutralizing Antibody 8ANC195 Recognizes Closed and Open States of HIV-1 Env Cell. 2015; 162 :1379-1390 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (106) PubMed Google Scholar ).
For RBD-absorption ELISA experiments to evaluate binding of purified polyclonal IgGs to CoV S1 B /RBD proteins after absorption of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific antibodies, biotinylated-S1 B /RBD proteins were captured on high-capacity streptavidin coated 96-well plates (Thermo Scientific) by incubating with 100 μL of 2 μg/mL protein solution in TBS overnight at 4°C. Plates were washed 3x in washing buffer and blocked as described above. For absorption of RBD-specific antibodies, 100 μL of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-coupled resin or 2G12 control resin was incubated with 100 μL of purified IgGs diluted to ∼1 mg/mL for 1 h at RT with agitation. After incubation, SARS-CoV-2 RBD-coupled resin was gently centrifuged at 250 x g for 2 min, and non-absorbed IgGs were removed by careful pipetting of the aqueous layer above the pelleted RBD-coupled resin. Unadsorbed and absorbed IgG samples were assayed at a 50 μg/mL starting concentration and seven 4-fold serial dilutions as described above.
Pseudoviruses based on HIV lentiviral particles were prepared as described ( Robbiani et al., 2020 60. Robbiani, D.F. ∙ Gaebler, C. ∙ Muecksch, F. ... Convergent antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in convalescent Individuals Nature. 2020; Epub ahead of print Crossref Scopus (1262) PubMed Google Scholar ). Four-fold serially diluted purified polyclonal IgGs and Fabs from COVID-19 plasmas were incubated with SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus for 1 hour at 37°C. After incubation with 293T ACE2 cells for 48 hours at 37°C, cells were washed twice with PBS, lysed with Luciferase Cell Culture Lysis 5x reagent (Promega), and NanoLuc Luciferase activity in lysates was measured using the Nano-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega). Relative luminescence units (RLUs) were normalized to values derived from cells infected with pseudotyped virus in the absence of purified plasma IgGs or Fabs. Half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC 50 values) for purified plasma IgGs and Fabs were determined as molar concentrations (to account for the IgG versus Fab difference in molecular weight) using 4-parameter nonlinear regression (Prism, GraphPad).
Purified CoV-S trimers were adsorbed to freshly glow discharged PureC 300 mesh carbon-coated copper grids (EMD Sciences) for 1 min followed by 2% uranyl formate (Electron Microscopy Sciences) staining. Micrographs were recorded using Digital Micrograph software on a 120kV FEI Tecnai T12 equipped with a Gatan Ultrascan 2k X 2k CCD at a 52,000x nominal magnification.

To form polyclonal Fab-S complexes, 30 μg of SARS-CoV-2 S trimers were incubated overnight at RT with 30-50 mg/mL Fabs in 100 μL total volume (corresponding to ∼1000x the EC 50 values for ELISAs using purified polyclonal Fabs), and the complexes were purified by SEC on a Superose 6 increase 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). Fractions containing complexes were pooled and concentrated to 50 μg/mL and passed through a 0.1 μm filter before deposition on 300 mesh carbon-coated copper grids (Ted Pella) and stained with 1% (w/v) uranyl formate (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Grids were imaged at 300 keV using a Titan Krios transmission electron microscope (Thermo Fisher) operating at RT, equipped with a K3 direct electron detector (Gatan) using SerialEM 3.7 ( Mastronarde, 2005 40. Mastronarde, D.N. Automated electron microscope tomography using robust prediction of specimen movements J. Struct. Biol. 2005; 152 :36-51 Crossref Scopus (3089) PubMed Google Scholar ). Images were processed in cryoSPARC v 2.14, and a reference-free particle stack was generated using a Gaussian blob picker ( Punjani et al., 2017 56. Punjani, A. ∙ Rubinstein, J.L. ∙ Fleet, D.J. ... cryoSPARC: algorithms for rapid unsupervised cryo-EM structure determination Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :290-296 Crossref Scopus (3666) PubMed Google Scholar ). Particles corresponding to S-Fab complexes were identified by extensive 2D classification to identify class averages that displayed structural elements interpreted as Fab density and also represented different views. Extracted particles were used to generate ab initio models in cryoSPARC that were further processed by 3D classification to separate out complexes and S trimer structures alone. Figures were prepared using UCSF Chimera ( Goddard et al., 2007 16. Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ∙ Ferrin, T.E. Visualizing density maps with UCSF Chimera J. Struct.

Broad and Potent Neutralizing Antibodies Recognize the Silent Face of the HIV Envelope Immunity. 2019; 50 :1513-1529 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (68) PubMed Google Scholar ). Crystallization trials were performed at room temperature using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method by mixing equal volumes of C105 Fab and reservoir using a TTP LabTech Mosquito robot and commercially available screens (Hampton Research). After optimization of initial hits, crystals were obtained in 0.15 M lithium sulfate, 0.1 M citric acid pH 3.5, 18% v/v PEG 6000 at 20°C. Crystals were transferred stepwise to 20% glycerol cryoprotectant before being cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen.
X-ray diffraction data were collected for C105 Fab at the Stanford Synchroton Radiation Lightsource (SSRL) beamline 12-1 on a Pilatus 6M pixel detector (Dectris). Data from a single crystal were indexed and integrated in XDS ( Kabsch, 2010 28. Kabsch, W. XDS Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :125-132 Crossref Scopus (12648) PubMed Google Scholar ) and merged using AIMLESS in CCP4 ( Winn et al., 2011 84. Winn, M.D. ∙ Ballard, C.C. ∙ Cowtan, K.D. ... Overview of the CCP4 suite and current developments Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2011; 67 :235-242 Crossref Scopus (10070) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Table S1 ). The structure of C105 Fab was determined by molecular replacement in PHASER ( McCoy et al., 2007 41. McCoy, A.J. ∙ Grosse-Kunstleve, R.W. ∙ Adams, P.D. ... Phaser crystallographic software J. Appl. Cryst. 2007; 40 :658-674 Crossref Scopus (15803) PubMed Google Scholar ) using the B38 Fab coordinates from PDB code 7BZ5 after removal of CDR loops as a search model. The C105 Fab coordinates were refined using Phenix ( Adams et al., 2010 1. Adams, P.D. ∙ Afonine, P.V. ∙ Bunkóczi, G. ... PHENIX: a comprehensive Python-based system for macromolecular structure solution Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :213-221 Crossref Scopus (18121) PubMed Google Scholar ) and cycles of manual building in Coot ( Emsley et al., 2010 14. Emsley, P. ∙ Lohkamp, B. ∙ Scott, W.G. ... Features and development of Coot Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :486-501 Crossref Scopus (19620) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Table S1 ).
Purified C105 Fab was incubated with SARS-CoV-2 S trimer at a 2:1 molar ratio per protomer on ice for 30 minutes prior to purification by SEC on a Superose 6 Increase 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). Fab–S complexes were concentrated to 1.6 mg/ml in Tris-buffered saline (TBS). Immediately before deposition onto a 300 mesh, 1.2/1.3 AuUltraFoil grid (Electron Microscopy Sciences) that had been freshly glow-discharged for 1 min at 20 mA using a PELCO easiGLOW (Ted Pella), 3 μL of complex was mixed with 0.5 μL of a 0.5% w/v octyl-maltoside, fluorinated solution (Anatrace). Samples were vitrified in 100% liquid ethane using a Mark IV Vitrobot (Thermo Fisher) after blotting for 3 s with Whatman No. 1 filter paper at 22°C and 100% humidity.
For the C105-S trimer complex, micrographs were collected on a Titan Krios transmission electron microscope (Thermo Fisher) operating at 300 kV using SerialEM automated data collection software ( Mastronarde, 2005 40. Mastronarde, D.N. Automated electron microscope tomography using robust prediction of specimen movements J. Struct. Biol. 2005; 152 :36-51 Crossref Scopus (3089) PubMed Google Scholar ). Movies were obtained on a Gatan K3 Summit direct electron detector operating in counting mode at a nominal magnification of 105,000x (super-resolution 0.418 Å/pixel) using a defocus range of −1 to −2.5 μm. Movies were collected with an 1.9 s exposure time with a rate of 22 e - /pix/s, which resulted in a total dose of ∼60 e-/Å 2 over 40 frames. The 5,940 cryo-EM movies were patch motion corrected for beam-induced motion including dose-weighting within cryoSPARC v2.15 ( Punjani et al., 2017 56. Punjani, A. ∙ Rubinstein, J.L. ∙ Fleet, D.J. ... cryoSPARC: algorithms for rapid unsupervised cryo-EM structure determination Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :290-296 Crossref Scopus (3666) PubMed Google Scholar ) after binning super resolution movies by 2 (0.836 Å/pixel). The non-dose-weighted images were used to estimate CTF parameters using CTFFIND4 ( Rohou and Grigorieff, 2015 63. Rohou, A. ∙ Grigorieff, N. CTFFIND4: Fast and accurate defocus estimation from electron micrographs J. Struct. Biol. 2015; 192 :216-221 Crossref Scopus (2721) PubMed Google Scholar ), and micrographs with power spectra that showed poor CTF fits or signs of crystalline ice were discarded, leaving 5,316 micrographs. Particles were picked in a reference-free manner using Gaussian blob picker in cryoSPARC ( Punjani et al., 2017 56. Punjani, A. ∙ Rubinstein, J.L. ∙ Fleet, D.J. ... cryoSPARC: algorithms for rapid unsupervised cryo-EM structure determination Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :290-296 Crossref Scopus (3666) PubMed Google Scholar ). An initial 565,939 particle stack was extracted, binned x2 (1.68 Å/pixel), and subjected to iterative rounds of reference-free 2D classification to identify class averages corresponding to intact S-trimer complexes with well-defined structural features. This routine resulted in a new particle stack of 71,289 particles, which were unbinned (0.836 Å/pixel) and re-extracted using a 352 box size. Two ab initio volumes were generated, with one class of 61,737 particles revealing an S-trimer complexed with two C105 Fabs.
Particles were further 3D classified (k = 3) and heterogeneously refined to reveal two distinct states of the C105-S trimer complex. State 1 (37,615 particles) displaying 2 “up” RBD conformations bound by 2 C105 Fabs, and state 2 (14,119 particles) that displayed 3 “up” RBD conformations bound by 3 C105 Fabs. Particles from states 1 and 2 were separately refined using non-uniform 3D refinement imposing either C1 or C3 symmetry, respectively, to final resolutions of 3.6 Å (state 1; 37,615 particles) and 3.7 Å (state 2; 14,119 particles) according to the gold-standard FSC ( Bell et al., 2016 2. Bell, J.M. ∙ Chen, M. ∙ Baldwin, P.R. ... High resolution single particle refinement in EMAN2.1 Methods. 2016; 100 :25-34 Crossref Scopus (116) PubMed Google Scholar ). Given that the RBD “up” conformations with C105 Fabs bound were similar in both states 1 and 2, improvements to the resolution at the RBD-C105 Fab interface were achieved by combining the entire particle stack (∼52k particles) for a focused, non-uniform 3D refinement. A soft mask was generated from the state 1 volume (5-pixel extension, 10-pixel soft cosine edge) for the S1 subunits and C105 Fab variable domains. These efforts resulted in a modest improvement in the RBD-C105 Fab interface ( Figure S6 D), and an overall resolution of 3.4 Å according to the gold-standard FSC.
Initial coordinates were generated by docking individual chains from reference structures into cryo-EM density using UCSF Chimera ( Goddard et al., 2007 16. Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ∙ Ferrin, T.E. Visualizing density maps with UCSF Chimera J. Struct. Biol. 2007; 157 :281-287 Crossref Scopus (663) PubMed Google Scholar ). The following coordinates were used: SARS-CoV-2 S trimer: PDB code 6VYB , “up” RBD conformations: PDB code 7BZ5 , C105 Fab: this study. These initial models were then refined into cryo-EM maps using one round of rigid body refinement followed by real space refinement. Sequence-updated models were built manually in Coot ( Emsley et al., 2010 14. Emsley, P. ∙ Lohkamp, B. ∙ Scott, W.G. ... Features and development of Coot Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :486-501 Crossref Scopus (19620) PubMed Google Scholar ) and then refined using iterative rounds of refinement in Coot and Phenix ( Adams et al., 2010 1. Adams, P.D. ∙ Afonine, P.V. ∙ Bunkóczi, G. ... PHENIX: a comprehensive Python-based system for macromolecular structure solution Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :213-221 Crossref Scopus (18121) PubMed Google Scholar ). Glycans were modeled at possible N-linked glycosylation sites (PNGSs) in Coot using ‘blurred’ maps processed with a variety of B-factors ( Terwilliger et al., 2018 73. Terwilliger, T.C. ∙ Adams, P.D. ∙ Afonine, P.V. ... A fully automatic method yielding initial models from high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy maps Nat. Methods. 2018; 15 :905-908 Crossref Scopus (93) PubMed Google Scholar ). Validation of model coordinates was performed using MolProbity ( Chen et al., 2010 7. Chen, V.B. ∙ Arendall, 3rd, W.B. ∙ Headd, J.J. ... MolProbity: all-atom structure validation for macromolecular crystallography Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :12-21 Crossref Scopus (10877) PubMed Google Scholar ) and is reported in Table S3 .
Structural figures were made using PyMOL (Version 1.8.2.1 Schrodinger, LLC) or UCSF Chimera ( Goddard et al., 2007 16. Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ∙ Ferrin, T.E. Visualizing density maps with UCSF Chimera J. Struct. Biol. 2007; 157 :281-287 Crossref Scopus (663) PubMed Google Scholar ). Local resolution maps were calculated using cryoSPARC v 2.15 ( Punjani et al., 2017 56. Punjani, A. ∙ Rubinstein, J.L. ∙ Fleet, D.J. ... cryoSPARC: algorithms for rapid unsupervised cryo-EM structure determination Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :290-296 Crossref Scopus (3666) PubMed Google Scholar ).
For ELISAs to evaluate plasma IgG binding to human CoV proteins, the average signals from independent experiments were plotted as area under the curve (AUC) using MATLAB R2019a (MathWorks). The number of replicates for each experiment is described in the figure or table legends. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05. The comparison of the neutralization potencies of plasma IgGs and Fabs (n = 12) was performed using a two-tailed paired t test. The frequency of VH3-53 / VH3-66 gene usage among the cloned anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs in 6 individuals was compared to human repertoire V gene usage using a two-tailed t test with unequal variances as described ( Robbiani et al., 2020 60. Robbiani, D.F. ∙ Gaebler, C. ∙ Muecksch, F. ... Convergent antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in convalescent Individuals Nature. 2020; Epub ahead of print Crossref Scopus (1262) PubMed Google Scholar ). The two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to compare the CDRH3 length distribution of VH3-53 and VH3-66 mAbs (together) with the 534 set or the human repertoire was performed using the Quest Graph Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) Test Calculator, AAT Bioquest, Inc, https://www.aatbio.com/tools/kolmogorov-smirnov-k-s-test-calculator . The VH3-53/VH3-66 CDRH3 length comparison with the 534 set was also evaluated using the two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test, which indicated p < 0.001.
