Title: Maladaptive innate immune training of myelopoiesis links inflammatory comorbidities


Abstract: Summary

Bone marrow (BM)-mediated trained innate immunity (TII) is a state of heightened immune responsiveness of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) and their myeloid progeny. We show here that maladaptive BM-mediated TII underlies inflammatory comorbidities, as exemplified by the periodontitis-arthritis axis. Experimental-periodontitis-related systemic inflammation in mice induced epigenetic rewiring of HSPC and led to sustained enhancement of production of myeloid cells with increased inflammatory preparedness. The periodontitis-induced trained phenotype was transmissible by BM transplantation to naive recipients, which exhibited increased inflammatory responsiveness and disease severity when subjected to inflammatory arthritis. IL-1 signaling in HSPC was essential for their maladaptive training by periodontitis. Therefore, maladaptive innate immune training of myelopoiesis underlies inflammatory comorbidities and may be pharmacologically targeted to treat them via a holistic approach.

Section: Introduction

Innate immune cells are now appreciated to retain heterologous memory of earlier microbial or inflammatory challenges that enables them to respond stronger upon future challenge with the same or unrelated stimuli. This state of heightened responsiveness, which is based on epigenetic innate immune memory, is designated as “trained innate immunity” (TII) ( Netea et al., 2020 57.

We, and others, have shown that systemic inflammatory stimuli can initiate TII in the mouse and human bone marrow (BM) through long-lasting adaptations in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC), associated with a long-term myeloid bias (“trained myelopoiesis”) ( Chavakis et al., 2019 9.

Experimental studies show that TII can be protective against infections and tumors ( Ciarlo et al., 2020 10. Ciarlo, E. ∙ Heinonen, T. ∙ Théroude, C. ...

However, TII is potentially detrimental, hence maladaptive, in chronic inflammatory pathologies ( Chavakis et al., 2019 9. Chavakis, T. ∙ Mitroulis, I. ∙ Hajishengallis, G. Hematopoietic progenitor cells as integrative hubs for adaptation to and fine-tuning of inflammation Nat. Immunol. 2019; 20 :802-811 Crossref Scopus (184) PubMed Google Scholar ).
By expressing Toll-like receptors and receptors for cytokines and growth factors, HSPC sense peripheral infection/inflammation and adapt via expansion and myeloid skewing ( Chavakis et al., 2019 9. Chavakis, T. ∙ Mitroulis, I. ∙ Hajishengallis, G. Hematopoietic progenitor cells as integrative hubs for adaptation to and fine-tuning of inflammation Nat. Immunol. 2019; 20 :802-811 Crossref Scopus (184) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, inflammation-adapted or trained HSPC could act as a central hub that perpetuates inflammation through a positive-feedback loop between the BM and peripheral tissues affected by inflammatory disorders ( Chavakis et al., 2019 9. Chavakis, T. ∙ Mitroulis, I. ∙ Hajishengallis, G. Hematopoietic progenitor cells as integrative hubs for adaptation to and fine-tuning of inflammation Nat. Immunol. 2019; 20 :802-811 Crossref Scopus (184) PubMed Google Scholar ), although experimental evidence for this hypothesis is scarce.
Here, we explored the concept that maladaptive TII in BM hematopoietic progenitors may provide a mechanistic link for inflammatory comorbidities, such as the enhanced risk of systemic diseases (e.g., cardiometabolic disease and arthritis) in periodontitis patients ( D’Aiuto et al., 2018 12.

The case for periodontitis in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis Nat. Rev. Rheumatol. 2017; 13 :606-620 Crossref Scopus (283) PubMed Google Scholar ). Periodontitis is a prevalent inflammatory disease of the soft and bone tissues that support the dentition and poses a significant public health burden ( Hajishengallis, 2015 28. Hajishengallis, G.

Oral diseases: a global public health challenge Lancet. 2019; 394 :249-260 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1637) PubMed Google Scholar ). Conceivably, the low-grade systemic inflammation caused by periodontitis may contribute to the periodontitis-systemic disease connection ( Genco and Sanz, 2020 25. Genco, R.J. ∙ Sanz, M.

Hajishengallis, G. ∙ Chavakis, T. Local and systemic mechanisms linking periodontal disease and inflammatory comorbidities Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2021; 21 :426-440 Crossref Scopus (564) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, compared with healthy controls, patients with severe periodontitis have elevated inflammatory mediators and neutrophil numbers in the blood ( D’Aiuto et al., 2013 13. D'Aiuto, F. ∙ Orlandi, M. ∙ Gunsolley, J.C. Evidence that periodontal treatment improves biomarkers and CVD outcomes J. Clin.

Mechanisms underlying the association between periodontitis and atherosclerotic disease Periodontol. 2000. 2020; 83 :90-106 Crossref Scopus (207) PubMed Google Scholar ). Conversely, successful local treatment of periodontitis attenuates systemic inflammatory markers ( Bajaj et al., 2018 2. Bajaj, J.S. ∙ Matin, P. ∙ White, M.B. ...

Mechanisms underlying the association between periodontitis and atherosclerotic disease Periodontol. 2000. 2020; 83 :90-106 Crossref Scopus (207) PubMed Google Scholar ). The relationship between periodontitis and linked comorbidities is often bidirectional as systemic diseases can promote susceptibility to periodontitis ( Genco and Sanz, 2020 25. Genco, R.J. ∙ Sanz, M. Clinical and public health implications of periodontal and systemic diseases: an overview Periodontol. 2000. 2020; 83 :7-13 Crossref Scopus (240) PubMed Google Scholar ; Winning and Linden, 2017 86. Winning, L. ∙ Linden, G.J. Periodontitis and systemic disease: association or causality? Curr. Oral Health Rep. 2017; 4 :1-7 Crossref Scopus (90) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, there is no documented unifying causal mechanism of how periodontitis affects and is affected by comorbidities.
Since many chronic inflammatory diseases are driven by inflammatory myeloid cells, we hypothesized that inflammation-driven alterations in their BM progenitors, as may occur in the context of maladaptive TII ( Chavakis et al., 2019 9. Chavakis, T. ∙ Mitroulis, I. ∙ Hajishengallis, G. Hematopoietic progenitor cells as integrative hubs for adaptation to and fine-tuning of inflammation Nat. Immunol. 2019; 20 :802-811 Crossref Scopus (184) PubMed Google Scholar ; Netea et al., 2020 57. Netea, M.G. ∙ Domínguez-Andrés, J. ∙ Barreiro, L.B. ... Defining trained immunity and its role in health and disease Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2020; 20 :375-388 Crossref Scopus (1267) PubMed Google Scholar ), could influence distinct inflammatory disorders that emerge as comorbidities. We addressed this hypothesis in the context of the comorbidity of periodontitis and arthritis, which leads to progressive erosion of cartilage and bone in the joints ( Smolen et al., 2018 78. Smolen, J.S. ∙ Aletaha, D. ∙ Barton, A. ... Rheumatoid arthritis Nat. Rev. Dis. Primers. 2018; 4 :18001 Crossref Scopus (968) PubMed Google Scholar ). An epidemiological association between these two inflammatory diseases remains even after adjusting for common risk factors ( de Pablo et al., 2008 15. de Pablo, P. ∙ Dietrich, T. ∙ McAlindon, T.E. Association of periodontal disease and tooth loss with rheumatoid arthritis in the US population J. Rheumatol. 2008; 35 :70-76 PubMed Google Scholar ; Scher et al., 2014 74. Scher, J.U. ∙ Bretz, W.A. ∙ Abramson, S.B. Periodontal disease and subgingival microbiota as contributors for rheumatoid arthritis pathogenesis: modifiable risk factors? Curr. Opin. Rheumatol. 2014; 26 :424-429 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our present findings show that maladaptive BM-mediated TII underlies the comorbid connection between periodontitis and arthritis, as modeled by ligature-induced periodontitis (LIP) and collagen antibody-induced arthritis (CAIA) in mice.

Section: Results

We first investigated whether experimental periodontitis induces inflammatory adaptation of HSPC in the BM. To this end, mice were subjected, or not, to LIP by ligature placement around the left and right maxillary second molar teeth. After 7 days, LIP-subjected mice displayed significantly higher frequency and numbers of hematopoietic progenitors (LSK; Lin − cKit + Sca1 + ) and multipotent progenitors (MPP; CD48 + CD150 − LSK) in the BM, as compared with unligated controls ( Figure S1 A). No difference was found in long-term (LT)-hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) (CD48 − CD150 + LSK), whereas the frequency and numbers of short-term (ST)-HSC (CD48 − CD150 − LSK) were decreased ( Figure S1 A). The LIP-induced increase in MPP was associated with an increase in the frequency of the myeloid-biased MPP3 subset (Flt3 − CD48 + CD150 − LSK) ( Pietras et al., 2015 63. Pietras, E.M. ∙ Reynaud, D. ∙ Kang, Y.A. ... Functionally distinct subsets of lineage-biased multipotent progenitors control blood production in normal and regenerative conditions Cell Stem Cell. 2015; 17 :35-46 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (420) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S1 B). No significant difference was observed in the lymphoid-biased MPP4 (Flt3 + CD48 + CD150 − LSK) or the erythro-megakaryocytic-biased MPP2 subset (Flt3 − CD48 + CD150 + LSK) ( Pietras et al., 2015 63. Pietras, E.M. ∙ Reynaud, D. ∙ Kang, Y.A. ... Functionally distinct subsets of lineage-biased multipotent progenitors control blood production in normal and regenerative conditions Cell Stem Cell. 2015; 17 :35-46 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (420) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S1 B). Although the total numbers of LT-HSC remained unaltered ( Figure S1 A), LIP led to increased frequencies of CD41 + and CD61 + LT-HSC subpopulations ( Figure S1 C); CD41 + LT-HSC harbor myeloid-biased cells ( Gekas and Graf, 2013 24. Gekas, C. ∙ Graf, T. CD41 expression marks myeloid-biased adult hematopoietic stem cells and increases with age Blood. 2013; 121 :4463-4472 Crossref Scopus (236) PubMed Google Scholar ) and CD61 + LT-HSC are responsive to inflammatory stimuli ( Mann et al., 2018 49. Mann, M. ∙ Mehta, A. ∙ de Boer, C.G. ... Heterogeneous responses of hematopoietic stem cells to inflammatory stimuli are altered with age Cell Rep. 2018; 25 :2992-3005.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (106) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Although LIP causes substantial bone loss within a few days, maintaining the ligatures for 21 days mimics the chronic phase of human periodontitis. Mice subjected to LIP for 21 days maintained the changes seen at day 7 ( Figure S1 ), such as, increased frequency and numbers of LSK and MPP ( Figure 1 A). The elevated frequency of myeloid-biased MPP3 was now associated with a decreased frequency of lymphoid-biased MPP4 in LIP-subjected mice ( Figure 1 B). There was an even more pronounced difference on day 21 (than on day 7) between LIP-subjected and control mice regarding the elevated frequencies of CD41 + and CD61 + LT-HSC in the former group ( Figure 1 C). Analysis of myeloid progenitors (MyP; Lin − cKit + Sca1 − ) revealed that LIP led to elevated absolute numbers of granulocyte macrophage progenitors (GMP; Lin − cKit + Sca1 − CD16/32 + CD34 + ) and increased proportion of GMP within the MyP population, associated with a corresponding reduction in the relative abundance of common myeloid progenitors (CMP; Lin − cKit + Sca1 − CD16/32 − CD34 + ) ( Figure 1 D). Consistently, LIP-subjected mice exhibited an increased proportion of Gr1 hi CD11b + granulocytes and Gr1 int CD11b + myeloid cells with a corresponding reduction in the proportion of CD19 + B cells and CD3 + T cells, compared with the proportions of these populations in control mice ( Figure 1 E). Hence, chronic LIP leads to sustained enhancement of myelopoiesis.
To study the mechanisms underlying the LIP-induced myeloid bias in HSPCs, we performed transcriptome analysis of LSK from LIP-subjected and control mice. We identified 2,139 differentially expressed genes of which 979 and 1,160 genes were significantly up- or downregulated, respectively, in LSK from LIP-subjected mice, compared with those from control mice (false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.05) ( Figure 1 F). Principal component analysis (PCA) showed a clear separation between the two groups ( Figure 1 G). Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis revealed that several GO terms, including “myeloid leukocyte migration,” “innate immune response,” and “neutrophil-mediated immunity,” were overrepresented in the significantly upregulated genes, whereas terms such as “cellular response to interleukin-7,” “erythrocyte differentiation,” or “lymphocyte proliferation” were overrepresented in the significantly downregulated genes ( Figures 1 H and 1I). Significant upregulation of myeloid lineage markers, including Cd68 , Csf1r , kit , Ccr2 , Csf3r , and Mpo ( Figure S1 D), and downregulation of lymphoid lineage and erythrocyte markers were observed in LSK of LIP-subjected mice ( Figure S1 E). Moreover, the GO terms “oxidative phosphorylation” and “mitochondrial acetyl-CoA biosynthetic process from pyruvate” were overrepresented in the significantly downregulated genes, which was consistent with the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis ( Figure 1 I). Accordingly, the expression of genes encoding NADH dehydrogenase (e.g., Ndufc2 and Ndufs6 ) and ATP synthase (e.g., Atp5d and Atp5o ) were significantly downregulated ( Figure S1 E). The GO terms “interleukin-1-mediated signaling pathway” and the KEGG pathway “osteoclast differentiation” were also significantly overrepresented ( Figures 1 H and S1 ). Also, the GO terms “negative regulation of histone H3-K9 methylation” (GO:0051573), “histone H3-K4 trimethylation” (GO:0080182), “positive regulation of DNA demethylation” (GO:1901537), and “histone H3-K9 demethylation” (GO:0033169) were overrepresented in the significantly upregulated genes, whereas the GO term “positive regulation of histone H3-K27 methylation” (GO:0061087) was significantly overrepresented in the significantly downregulated genes ( Figures 1 H and 1I). Hence, the expression of Kdm1a ( Perillo et al., 2008 60. Perillo, B. ∙ Ombra, M.N. ∙ Bertoni, A. ... DNA oxidation as triggered by H3K9me2 demethylation drives estrogen-induced gene expression Science. 2008; 319 :202-206 Crossref Scopus (444) PubMed Google Scholar ), Kdm3b ( Kim et al., 2012 38.

Biol. 2012; 32 :2917-2933 Crossref Scopus (85) PubMed Google Scholar ), and Pax5 ( Johnson et al., 2004 32. Johnson, K. ∙ Pflugh, D.L. ∙ Yu, D. ... B cell-specific loss of histone 3 lysine 9 methylation in the V(H) locus depends on Pax5 Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5 :853-861 Crossref Scopus (95) PubMed Google Scholar ) (critical for H3-K9 demethylation) as well as Tet3 ( Deplus et al., 2013 16. Deplus, R. ∙ Delatte, B. ∙ Schwinn, M.K. ... TET2 and TET3 regulate GlcNAcylation and H3K4 methylation through OGT and SET1/COMPASS EMBO J. 2013; 32 :645-655 Crossref Scopus (378) PubMed Google Scholar ) and Ncoa6 ( Qing et al., 2014 66. Qing, Y. ∙ Yin, F. ∙ Wang, W. ... The Hippo effector Yorkie activates transcription by interacting with a histone methyltransferase complex through Ncoa6 eLife. 2014; 3 Crossref Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ) (critical for H3-K4 methylation) was upregulated, whereas the expression of Mtf2 ( Perino et al., 2018 61. Perino, M. ∙ van Mierlo, G. ∙ Karemaker, I.D. ... MTF2 recruits polycomb repressive complex 2 by helical-shape-selective DNA binding Nat. Genet. 2018; 50 :1002-1010 Crossref Scopus (122) PubMed Google Scholar ) and Eed ( Margueron et al., 2009 51. Margueron, R. ∙ Justin, N. ∙ Ohno, K. ... Role of the polycomb protein EED in the propagation of repressive histone marks Nature. 2009; 461 :762-767 Crossref Scopus (903) PubMed Google Scholar ) (critical for H3-K27 methylation) was downregulated ( Figure S1 F).
Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) for upstream regulators revealed that several myeloid transcription factors (TF) were predicted to act as upstream regulators in LSK from LIP-subjected mice, compared with those of control mice, including CEBPA, CEBPE, ID1, ID2, and SPI1 (PU.1) ( Figure S1 G), which mediates IL-1β-induced HSC myeloid differentiation ( Pietras et al., 2016 62. Pietras, E.M. ∙ Mirantes-Barbeito, C. ∙ Fong, S. ... Chronic interleukin-1 exposure drives haematopoietic stem cells towards precocious myeloid differentiation at the expense of self-renewal Nat. Cell Biol. 2016; 18 :607-618 Crossref Scopus (454) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, IL-1β/IL-1 and growth factors (CSF2 and CSF3) involved in myelopoiesis were also predicted to act on LSK from LIP-subjected mice ( Figure S1 G). These findings suggest transcriptomic rewiring of BM progenitors associated with inflammatory signaling, such as IL-1.
We then investigated if hematopoietic progenitors of mice with previous LIP exposure, but without active disease, can elicit enhanced myelopoiesis responses and generate hyper-responsive myeloid cells to a future challenge. Ligature removal abrogates the microbial challenge that drives inflammation, thereby leading to periodontitis resolution ( Kourtzelis et al., 2019 41. Kourtzelis, I. ∙ Li, X. ∙ Mitroulis, I. ... DEL-1 promotes macrophage efferocytosis and clearance of inflammation Nat. Immunol. 2019; 20 :40-49 Crossref Scopus (167) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yuh et al., 2020 87. Yuh, D.Y. ∙ Maekawa, T. ∙ Li, X. ... The secreted protein DEL-1 activates a β3 integrin-FAK-ERK1/2-RUNX2 pathway and promotes osteogenic differentiation and bone regeneration J. Biol. Chem. 2020; 295 :7261-7273 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mice were thus subjected to LIP for 21 days followed by ligature removal. After 14 days (when local periodontal inflammation was resolved; Figure S2 A), analysis of BM myelopoiesis revealed no significant differences between LIP-subjected and control mice ( Figures S2 B–S2F), except for slight differences between the two groups regarding the proportion of GMP within the MyP ( Figure S2 E). Thus, inflammation resolution in the periodontium quantitatively restores phenotypic myelopoiesis, as assessed by flow cytometry, to basal levels.
Next, we performed scRNA-seq in sorted LSK from mice subjected to 21 days LIP followed by 14 days resolution (“21dL/14dR” mice) and naive controls (rested for 35 days; “NL” mice). Two-dimensional uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) of 15,257 (NL: 7,051; 21dL/14dR: 8,206) LSK and clustering, partitioned LSK into 8 clusters (C1–C8) ( Figures 2 A and 2B). Although most clusters were comparably represented in the 21dL/14dR and NL groups, C7 was modestly enriched with cells from the 21dL/14dR group ( Figure 2 C). However, C7 comprised a tiny portion of LSK ( Figure 2 B). GO enrichment analysis of C7-specific markers showed that the GO terms “leukocyte activation” and “regulation of myeloid cell differentiation” were in the top 20 significantly enriched GO terms ( Figure S2 G). There were no significant differences in myeloid marker expression in the overall LSK population from “21dL/14dR” mice compared with those from NL mice ( Figure S2 H).
We then addressed possible qualitative alterations (associated with trained myelopoiesis) in hematopoietic progenitors of LIP-subjected mice currently under LIP resolution (“LIP-experienced” mice). We investigated if the LIP-induced modulation of HSPC could promote a higher response of hematopoietic progenitors to future systemic challenge with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) ( Mitroulis et al., 2017 53. Mitroulis, I. ∙ Chen, L.-S. ∙ Singh, R.P. ... Secreted protein Del-1 regulates myelopoiesis in the hematopoietic stem cell niche J. Clin. Invest. 2017; 127 :3624-3639 Crossref Scopus (69) PubMed Google Scholar ), which would be indicative of inflammatory memory in the BM. To this end, mice, previously subjected to LIP for 21 days followed by ligature removal for 28 days, received a single LPS dose i.p.; BM analysis was performed after 72 h ( Figure 2 D). LIP-experienced mice exhibited a stronger response to LPS than naive controls, as shown by significantly increased frequency and numbers of the LSK and MPP pools ( Figure 2 E), GMP ( Figure 2 F), as well as Gr1 hi CD11b + granulocytes and Gr1 int CD11b + myeloid cells ( Figure 2 G). Consistently, the LIP-experienced group showed significantly higher white blood cell counts and Gr1 + CD11b + cells in peripheral blood ( Figure 2 H). Upon LPS challenge, LIP-experienced mice also exhibited significantly higher frequencies of Gr1 hi CD11b + and Gr1 int CD11b + cells in the lungs ( Figure 2 I), compared with LPS-challenged controls. Therefore, BM hematopoietic progenitors of LIP-experienced mice maintain a myeloid differentiation bias and respond with enhanced myelopoiesis to a future systemic challenge. LIP-experienced mice are thereafter referred to as “LIP-trained” mice. Consistent with the notion of LIP-induced inflammatory memory, mature myeloid progeny (spleen-derived neutrophils and monocytes) of LIP-trained mice responded with higher IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) production to secondary ( ex vivo ) LPS challenge than their counterparts from naive controls ( Figures 2 J and 2K).
The ability of hematopoietic progenitors and mature myeloid cells from LIP-trained mice to respond stronger to future LPS challenges ( Figures 2 D–2K) suggested the emergence of an epigenetically-based innate immune memory. To establish LIP-induced innate immune memory, we tested if LIP can indeed induce epigenetic rewiring of BM progenitors.
We thus performed single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (scATAC-seq) analysis of hematopoietic progenitors LSK and GMP in mice that were trained by subjecting them to LIP for 21 days followed by ligature removal for 14 days (“21dL/14dR” mice) or were not ligated during the entire period (“NL” controls) ( Figure 3 ). Two-dimensional UMAP of 12,758 (NL: 5,341; 21dL/14dR: 7,417) LSK and 25,145 (NL: 12,944; 21dL/14dR: 12,201) GMP ( Figure 3 A) and clustering, partitioned LSK and GMP into 15 clusters (C1–C15) ( Figure 3 B). C2, C7, C8, C10, and C12–C14 comprised LSK; C1, C3–C6 comprised GMP, and C9, C11, and C15 included both LSK and GMP ( Figure 3 C). The LSK cluster C2 displayed enhanced chromatin accessibility in genes indicating myeloid differentiation, Itga2b ( Cd41 ) and Gata2 ( Figure S3 A). The GMP cluster C3 showed enhanced chromatin accessibility in genes with an inflammatory signature: Csf1r , encodes CD115 and promotes myelopoiesis; and Nlrp3 , encodes Nod-like receptor (NLR) family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) and acts as an inflammasome component contributing to IL-1β secretion ( Figure S3 B).
In line with a LIP-induced increased myeloid bias in LSK ( Figures 1 and S1 ), differential accessibility analysis revealed differentially accessible regions (DARs) in LSK from “21dL/14dR”-trained mice as compared with LSK from “NL” mice ( Figure 3 D). The top 20 significantly enriched GO terms in LSK, identified on the basis of genes annotated to regions more accessible due to LIP-induced training, revealed terms such as “regulation of cell differentiation,” “regulation of metabolic process,” and “cell migration” ( Figure 3 E), consistent with the LSK RNA-seq results ( Figure 1 H) and with previous findings implicating metabolic reprogramming in TII ( Hajishengallis et al., 2021 30. Hajishengallis, G. ∙ Li, X. ∙ Chavakis, T. Immunometabolic control of hematopoiesis Mol. Aspects Med. 2021; 77 :100923 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ). GO enrichment analysis of the enriched TF motifs in LSK revealed that the GO terms “myeloid cell differentiation,” “granulocyte differentiation,” “NIK/NF-kappaB signaling,” and “response to interleukin-1” were significantly enriched by LIP-induced TII ( Figure 3 F). The top enriched TF motifs in the GO term “myeloid cell differentiation” includes SPI1 (PU.1), KLF2 (Krüppel-like transcription factor 2, a potent regulator of myeloid cell activation) ( Mahabeleshwar et al., 2011 48. Mahabeleshwar, G.H. ∙ Kawanami, D. ∙ Sharma, N. ... The myeloid transcription factor KLF2 regulates the host response to polymicrobial infection and endotoxic shock Immunity. 2011; 34 :715-728 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (113) PubMed Google Scholar ), and the GO term “granulocyte differentiation” includes the TF motifs CEBPA, CEBPE, SP3, SPI1, and GATA2 ( Figure 3 G). The GO term “NIK/NF-kappaB signaling” includes REL, RELA, RELB, and NFKB2, indicating that the NF-κB binding motifs are more accessible in LSK from “21dL/14dR” mice than in their counterparts from NL mice ( Figure 3 G); in the GO term “response to interleukin-1,” the enrichment of TF motifs IRF1, CEBPB, and EGR1 implied the activation of IL-1 signaling pathway ( Figure 3 G), consistent with the transcriptomic analysis of LSK ( Figures 1 F–1I and S1 D–S1G). A genome browser track displays a DAR in the Il6 gene locus and the RELA binding motifs within this region ( Figure 3 H, top), as well as DARs near the promoter regions of Tlr4 and Myd88 gene locus in LSK from “21dL/14dR” (trained) and control (NL) mice ( Figure 3 H, bottom).
Differentiation trajectories analysis showed that C4 and C5 existed at the end of the pseudotime trajectories from LSK to GMP ( Figure S3 C), suggesting that they consist of the most differentiated myeloid precursors within GMP, in which C5 was significantly enriched by LIP-induced TII ( Figure 3 C). GO enrichment analysis of C5-specific markers revealed that the GO terms “myeloid cell differentiation,” “positive regulation of ROS metabolic process,” “regulation of phagocytosis,” and “positive regulation of MAPK cascade” were significantly enriched by LIP-induced TII ( Figure S3 D). C5 also showed enhanced chromatin accessibility in Tlr4 , as well as Camk1d , which encodes calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase 1D that promotes reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and phagocytosis by granulocytes ( Verploegen et al., 2005 84. Verploegen, S. ∙ Ulfman, L. ∙ van Deutekom, H.W. ... Characterization of the role of CaMKI-like kinase (CKLiK) in human granulocyte function Blood. 2005; 106 :1076-1083 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ); Itga1 , encoding CD49a, which promotes neutrophil migration ( Ridger et al., 2001 69. Ridger, V.C. ∙ Wagner, B.E. ∙ Wallace, W.A. ... Differential effects of CD18, CD29, and CD49 integrin subunit inhibition on neutrophil migration in pulmonary inflammation J. Immunol. 2001; 166 :3484-3490 Crossref Scopus (91) PubMed Google Scholar ); and Map2k4 , encoding MAP2K4, which phosphorylates mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases (MAPK)8/JNK1, MAPK9/JNK2, and MAPK14/p38 in response to environmental stresses or stimuli ( Figure S3 E).
Therefore, scATAC-seq suggests that LIP-induced training is associated with a sustained myeloid lineage bias in LSK, allowing for an enhanced myelopoiesis response upon secondary stimulation, as well as pro-inflammatory signatures in both LSK and GMP. Moreover, the results of the scATAC-seq analysis reveal that, upon LIP resolution, HSPC retain an epigenetic myeloid differentiation bias.
We next determined whether the above-documented inflammatory memory renders LIP-trained mice more susceptible to arthritis, as modeled by CAIA ( Khachigian, 2006 37. Khachigian, L.M. Collagen antibody-induced arthritis Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1 :2512-2516 Crossref Scopus (125) PubMed Google Scholar ). To this end, mice subjected to LIP for 21 days followed by 14 days of ligature removal were challenged with CAIA. Mice without previous exposure to LIP were also challenged with CAIA and served as controls ( Figure S4 A). LIP-trained mice were more susceptible to CAIA than untrained controls, as evidenced by significantly higher clinical arthritis score and ankle joint thickness ( Figure S4 B). Whether this increased susceptibility to arthritis is mediated by an inflammatory LIP-BM axis was addressed by BM transplantation (BMT) experiments from LIP-trained mice to naive recipients.
To this end, BM cells were isolated from CD45.2 + mice, which were either trained by subjecting them to 21-day LIP followed by 14-day resolution (“21dL/14dR” mice), or were left untrained, and transferred to lethally irradiated congenic B6.SJL CD45.1 + mice. Next, 12 weeks post-BMT, groups of recipient CD45.1 + mice were subjected to LIP (for 5 days) or CAIA (14 days) ( Figure 4 A). CD45.1 + mice transplanted with BM cells from “21dL/14dR” mice developed increased bone loss ( Figure 4 B) and inflammatory gene expression ( Figure 4 C), as well as a higher abundance of monocytes and neutrophils and total CD45 + immune cells in the gingiva ( Figure 4 D), compared with CD45.1 + mice that received BM cells from untrained CD45.2 + mice. Similarly, upon induction of CAIA in CD45.1 + recipient mice, we observed more severe arthritis in mice transplanted with BM cells from 21dL/14dR mice than in mice transplanted with BM cells from untrained controls, as shown by increased clinical arthritis score and ankle joint thickness ( Figure 4 E) and aggravated histopathology in ankle joints ( Figure 4 F). Moreover, compared with the control group, CD45.1 + mice receiving BM cells from “21dL/14dR” CD45.2 + mice showed a higher abundance of monocytes and neutrophils and total CD45 + leukocytes in the synovium ( Figure 4 G). Mature splenic neutrophils and monocytes from CD45.1 + mice receiving BM cells from 21dL/14dR CD45.2 + donor mice responded with significantly higher secretion of IL-6 and TNF to secondary LPS challenge than their counterparts from CD45.1 + mice receiving BM cells from untrained CD45.2 + donors ( Figures S4 C and S4D). Thus, LIP-induced maladaptive TII confers increased susceptibility to not only periodontitis but also a comorbid condition, namely arthritis.
To exclude the possibility that the differences in the abundance of myeloid cells infiltrating the synovium of recipient groups were due to potential differences in the reconstitution potential of HSPC from the “21dL/14dR” donors versus those from untrained donors, we performed an analysis of BM and peripheral chimerism in recipient mice. Using the CD45.1/CD45.2 congenic system ( Figure 4 H), 100 LT-HSC isolated from “21dL/14dR” or control CD45.2 + mice were transplanted together with 5 × 10 5 CD45.1 + competitors to lethally irradiated C57BL/6.SJL CD45.1 + mice. At 16 weeks post-BMT, no differences were observed in the frequencies of HSPC derived from “21dL/14dR” or control donors ( Figures S4 E and S4F). Peripheral blood analysis at 4–16 weeks post-BMT showed no difference in white blood cell counts and in the percentages of “21dL/14dR” or control donor-derived cells ( Figure 4 I). However, LT-HSC from “21dL/14dR” mice gave rise to an elevated proportion of Gr1 + CD11b + myeloid cells with a corresponding decrease in the proportion of CD19 + B cells and CD3 + T cells, as compared with LT-HSC from control mice ( Figure 4 I). Thus, although there was no difference in the overall reconstitution potential, there was an inherent myeloid differentiation bias of the LT-HSC from the “21dL/14dR” group (versus those of controls), resulting from LIP-induced trained myelopoiesis in donor mice.
To demonstrate the bidirectional association of periodontitis with arthritis, as suggested by observations in humans ( Lee and Choi, 2020 42. Lee, K.H. ∙ Choi, Y.Y.

Association between severity of periodontitis and clinical activity in rheumatoid arthritis patients: a case-control study Arthritis Res. Ther. 2019; 21 :27 Crossref Scopus (88) PubMed Google Scholar ), we tested whether CAIA causes maladaptive training of HSPC leading to enhanced susceptibility to periodontitis. We first showed that CAIA significantly increased the frequency and numbers of LSK, LT-HSC, and MPP (versus controls; Figure S5 A), as well as the frequency of myeloid-biased MPP3 ( Figure S5 B) and CD41 + LT-HSC ( Figure S5 C). These changes were associated with decreased frequency of erythro-megakaryocytic-biased MPP2 and lymphoid-biased MPP4 ( Figure S5 B), thus signifying a myelopoiesis bias. Indeed, CAIA also resulted in increased numbers and frequency of GMP ( Figure S5 D) and of Gr1 hi CD11b + granulocytes in the BM ( Figure S5 E).
We next performed BMT experiments to test if CAIA-induced trained myelopoiesis underlies the comorbid connection between arthritis and periodontitis. To this end, BM cells were isolated from CD45.2 + mice 36 days after CAIA. This interval was selected based on observations that 22 days were required for resolution of arthritis ( Figure S5 F) and another 14 days were required for phenotypic restoration of myelopoiesis to steady-state levels ( Figure S5 G). BM cells from CAIA-experienced or untreated control CD45.2 + mice were transferred to lethally irradiated CD45.1 + recipients. Thereafter, 12 weeks post-BMT, groups of CD45.1 + recipient mice were subjected to LIP or CAIA ( Figure 5 A). CD45.1 + mice receiving BM cells from CAIA-subjected CD45.2 + mice developed increased periodontal bone loss ( Figure 5 B) and inflammatory gene expression ( Figure 5 C) and a higher gingival abundance of monocytes, neutrophils, and total CD45 + immune cells ( Figure 5 D), compared with CD45.1 + mice receiving BM cells from control CD45.2 + mice. Moreover, mice that received BM cells from CAIA-trained mice also developed more severe arthritis ( Figure 5 E), increased infiltration of monocytes, neutrophils, and total leukocytes in the joints ( Figure 5 F), and aggravated histopathology of ankle joints ( Figure 5 G), compared with the recipients of BM cells from untrained controls. Mature splenic neutrophils and monocytes from CD45.1 + mice receiving BM cells from CAIA-trained CD45.2 + mice responded with significantly higher production of IL-6 and TNF to secondary LPS challenge than their counterparts from CD45.1 + mice receiving BM cells from untrained CD45.2 + mice ( Figures S5 H and S5I). Therefore, LIP-induced (or CAIA-induced) inflammatory maladaptive training of BM progenitors confers, in a bidirectional fashion, increased susceptibility to inflammatory comorbid conditions, namely, periodontitis and arthritis.
To obtain evidence that maladaptive TII is initiated at the level of LT-HSC, we performed competitive BMT with the CD45.1/CD45.2 congenic system and sorted LT-HSC from LIP (“21dL/14dR”)-trained mice and untrained donors. Chimerism analysis in the BM at 12 weeks post-BMT showed no significant differences in the frequencies of LIP-trained or untrained control donor-derived cells ( Figure 5 H). Next, 12 weeks post-BMT, additional recipient CD45.1 + mice were subjected to CAIA. Compared with mice transplanted with LT-HSC from untrained CD45.2 + mice (“untrained” LT-HSC), mice receiving LT-HSC from trained CD45.2 + mice (“trained” LT-HSC) exhibited more severe arthritis ( Figure 5 I), a higher abundance of monocytes, neutrophils, and total CD45 + leukocytes in the synovium ( Figure 5 J), as well as increased percentage and counts of CD45.2 + monocytes, neutrophils, and leukocytes ( Figure 5 K). Mature splenic neutrophils and monocytes from mice that received trained LT-HSC responded with significantly higher secretion of IL-6 and TNF to secondary LPS challenge than their counterparts from mice transplanted with untrained LT-HSC ( Figure 5 L). Thus, periodontitis-trained LT-HSC lead to exacerbated inflammation and disease in transplanted mice in the context of a comorbid condition.
To determine if LIP-induced maladaptive TII was restricted to myeloid-biased LT-HSC, we performed a similar competitive BMT using sorted CD41 + (myeloid-biased) or CD41 – (non-biased) LT-HSC from LIP-trained or untrained CD45.2 + mice ( Figure S6 A). Peripheral blood analysis in mice receiving CD41 + LT-HSC showed no difference in white blood cell counts and percentage of LIP-trained or untrained donor-derived cells; however, LT-HSC from LIP-trained mice gave rise to an elevated proportion of Gr1 + CD11b + myeloid cells with a corresponding decrease in the proportion of CD19 + B cells and CD3 + T cells, relative to LT-HSC from control donors ( Figure S6 B). No differences were seen in the frequencies of HSPC in the BM derived from LIP-trained or control donors ( Figure S6 D), suggesting comparable engraftment. Similar observations were made in mice transplanted with CD41 – LT-HSC ( Figures S6 C and S6E). These findings reveal an inherent myeloid bias in both CD41 + and CD41 – LT-HSC from LIP-trained donors leading to higher myelopoiesis in recipient mice. Consistently, when recipient mice were subjected to CAIA, those transplanted with trained LT-HSC, regardless of CD41 phenotype, had exacerbated arthritis ( Figures S6 F and S6G) and joint inflammation ( Figures S6 H and S6I). Mature splenic myeloid cells from mice that received trained CD41 + or CD41 – LT-HSC responded with higher secretion of IL-6 and TNF to secondary LPS challenge than their counterparts from mice transplanted with untrained LT-HSC ( Figures S6 J and S6K). Thus, LIP can induce myeloid differentiation bias and a maladaptive trained phenotype even in LT-HSC that are not originally myeloid biased, at least phenotypically, based on CD41 expression.
To better understand how LIP modulates HSPC for enhanced myelopoiesis, we analyzed the BM extracellular fluid for cytokines implicated in the inflammatory modulation of HSPC ( Chavakis et al., 2019 9. Chavakis, T. ∙ Mitroulis, I. ∙ Hajishengallis, G. Hematopoietic progenitor cells as integrative hubs for adaptation to and fine-tuning of inflammation Nat. Immunol. 2019; 20 :802-811 Crossref Scopus (184) PubMed Google Scholar ), collected 14 days post-LIP (between 7 and 21 days when significant changes in HSPC modulation have occurred; Figures 1 and S1 ). We detected significantly increased concentrations of IL-1β and G-CSF (but not of other cytokines tested) in the BM extracellular fluid in LIP-subjected mice, relative to controls ( Figure 6 A). Parallel analysis of the same cytokines in the serum of LIP-subjected mice indicated an elevated concentration of G-CSF but not of IL-1β, relative to controls ( Figure 6 B). Analysis of cytokines upregulated in periodontitis ( Dutzan et al., 2018 18. Dutzan, N. ∙ Kajikawa, T. ∙ Abusleme, L. ... A dysbiotic microbiome triggers TH17 cells to mediate oral mucosal immunopathology in mice and humans Sci. Transl. Med. 2018; 10 :eaat0797 Crossref Scopus (245) PubMed Google Scholar ; Shin et al., 2015 76. Shin, J. ∙ Maekawa, T. ∙ Abe, T. ... DEL-1 restrains osteoclastogenesis and inhibits inflammatory bone loss in nonhuman primates Sci. Transl. Med. 2015; 7 307ra155 Crossref Scopus (77) PubMed Google Scholar ) revealed high abundance of IL-1β and G-CSF in the periodontal tissues of LIP-subjected mice, although the local induction of G-CSF (6.8-fold versus control) was more pronounced than that of IL-1β (2.3-fold versus control) ( Figure 6 C). These data suggested that LIP-induced serum G-CSF might access the BM, where it might induce IL-1β production.
To test this notion, HSPC, MyP, and distinct types of myeloid cells were sorted from the BM of mice subjected to LIP for 14 days. Analysis of G-CSF receptor (colony-stimulating factor 3 receptor, Csfr3 ) mRNA expression showed that mature neutrophils expressed the highest levels of Csf3r ( Figure 6 D). Analysis of Il1b expression in the same cell populations revealed that mature neutrophils were also a major source of Il1b ( Figure 6 D). Thus, mature neutrophils might be the cells that secrete IL-1β upon G-CSF stimulation in the BM. In support of this notion, mature neutrophils isolated from the BM of LIP-subjected (but not control) mice responded to recombinant G-CSF stimulation with dose-dependent increase of IL-1β production ( Figure 6 E). To identify possible target cells of IL-1β in the BM, we examined the same cell populations from the BM of LIP-subjected mice and found that LSK had the most prominent Il1r expression ( Figure 6 D). Thus, IL-1β secretion in the BM might link LIP-induced inflammation and activation of HSPC during trained myelopoiesis. Consistently, IL-1, IL-1β, and the myeloid transcription factor SPI1 (PU.1) were predicted as activated upstream regulators in LSK of LIP-subjected mice ( Figure S1 G). Moreover, the TF binding motifs enrichment analysis of the scATAC-seq using LSK revealed that the DNA binding sites of TFs responsive to IL-1 signaling pathway were significantly enriched in the LIP group, compared with control ( Figures 3 F and 3G).
To directly link IL-1 signaling to LIP-induced maladaptive trained myelopoiesis, we used mice with inducible deletion of IL-1 receptor specifically in HSPC, generated by breeding HSC-SCL-Cre-ERT mice ( Schoedel et al., 2016 75. Schoedel, K.B. ∙ Morcos, M.N.F. ∙ Zerjatke, T. ... The bulk of the hematopoietic stem cell population is dispensable for murine steady-state and stress hematopoiesis Blood. 2016; 128 :2285-2296 Crossref Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ) with Il1r1 fl/fl mice (HSC-SCL-Cre-ERT/ Il1r1 fl/fl ), hereafter designated Il1r1 HSPC-KO mice. Efficient Il1r1 deletion was achieved by administering tamoxifen by oral gavage, as described ( Schoedel et al., 2016 75. Schoedel, K.B. ∙ Morcos, M.N.F. ∙ Zerjatke, T. ... The bulk of the hematopoietic stem cell population is dispensable for murine steady-state and stress hematopoiesis Blood. 2016; 128 :2285-2296 Crossref Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ) and detailed in STAR Methods . After induction of deletion, Il1r1 HSPC-KO and littermate controls with intact IL1-R1 expression in HSPC were subjected to 21-day LIP. The HSPC-specific deletion of IL1-R1 resulted in reduced LIP-induced myelopoiesis, as evidenced by decreased frequencies of myeloid-biased HSPC subsets (MPP3 and CD41 + LT-HSC), GMP, Gr1 hi CD11b + granulocytes, and Gr1 int CD11b + myeloid cells ( Figure S7 A).
Using Il1r1 HSPC-KO mice and BMT, we next tested the hypothesis that IL-1 signaling in HSPC mediates LIP-induced trained myelopoiesis and increased inflammatory disease activity. To this end, groups of CD45.2 + Il1r1 HSPC-KO and littermate controls with intact IL1-R1 expression in HSPC were trained by subjecting them to 21-day LIP and 14-day resolution and then used as donors for BMT to groups of lethally irradiated congenic B6.SJL (CD45.1 + ) mice ( Figure 7 A). Subsequently, 12 weeks post-BMT, the recipient mice were euthanized for BM and peripheral chimerism analysis or were subjected to LIP for 5 days.
At 12 weeks post-BMT, CD45.1 + recipients (without any further challenge) that had received Il1r1 HSPC-KO BM cells from LIP-trained donor mice exhibited a reduced proportion of Gr1 + CD11b + myeloid cells with a corresponding increase in the proportion of CD19 + B cells and CD3 + T cells in the BM ( Figure 7 B) and peripheral blood ( Figure 7 C), as compared with mice that received wild-type (WT) BM cells. Consistently, analysis of MPP subsets and downstream progenitors in the BM showed that CD45.1 + mice receiving Il1r1 HSPC-KO BM cells had reduced frequency of the myeloid-biased MPP3 and GMP ( Figure 7 D). These findings indicate a reduced myeloid bias in HSPC due to IL1-R1 deficiency, especially, as the two groups of recipient mice displayed similar frequencies of donor-derived HSPC ( Figure S7 B). Mature splenic neutrophils and monocytes isolated from CD45.1 + mice transplanted with BM cells from Il1r1 HSPC-KO mice responded with significantly lower production of IL-6 and TNF to secondary LPS challenge than their counterparts from CD45.1 + mice that received BM cells from littermate controls bearing IL1-R1-sufficient HSPC ( Figure 7 E). These data suggest a critical role for HSPC-specific IL-1R signaling in LIP-induced trained myelopoiesis, associated with a transmissible myeloid differentiation bias and production of mature myeloid cells with increased inflammatory responsiveness.
Consistent with the demonstrated trained phenotype, LIP-subjected recipient CD45.1 + mice that received Il1r1 HSPC-KO BM cells from LIP-trained donor mice showed significantly decreased bone loss ( Figure 7 F) and reduced infiltration of the gingival tissue with monocytes, neutrophils, and total leukocytes, relative to control CD45.1 + mice that received BM cells from LIP-trained WT donor mice ( Figure 7 G). The decreased bone loss could not be attributed to a lack of IL-1R signaling in myeloid cells in the gingival tissue, since even mice with global deletion of IL1-R1 were equally susceptible to LIP as WT littermates ( Figure S7 C), as shown earlier ( Dutzan et al., 2018 18. Dutzan, N. ∙ Kajikawa, T. ∙ Abusleme, L. ... A dysbiotic microbiome triggers TH17 cells to mediate oral mucosal immunopathology in mice and humans Sci. Transl. Med. 2018; 10 :eaat0797 Crossref Scopus (245) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, IL-1R signaling acts on HSPC to mediate LIP-induced maladaptive training of myelopoiesis, which exacerbates periodontal inflammation and bone loss.

Section: Discussion

We demonstrated that maladaptive training of myelopoiesis underlies the emergence of inflammatory comorbidities, exemplified here with the periodontitis-arthritis axis. Experimental periodontitis-associated systemic inflammation induced long-lasting myeloid differentiation bias in HSPC that was retained predominantly at the epigenetic level, indicating prolonged readiness for myelopoiesis induction upon future challenges. The periodontitis-induced trained phenotype was transmissible by transplantation of sorted LT-HSC to naive recipients, which displayed increased severity of arthritis upon CAIA challenge. In line with the bidirectional association of periodontitis and rheumatoid arthritis ( Fuggle et al., 2016 22. Fuggle, N.R. ∙ Smith, T.O. ∙ Kaul, A. ...

The case for periodontitis in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis Nat. Rev. Rheumatol. 2017; 13 :606-620 Crossref Scopus (283) PubMed Google Scholar ), CAIA-induced alterations to BM HSPC toward a maladaptive inflammatory phenotype, which exacerbated experimental periodontitis in transplanted mice. Thus, induction of central BM-mediated TII due to an inflammatory disease increases susceptibility to another inflammatory condition (comorbidity).
Our present study results are consistent with recent clinical imaging studies based on 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography ( 18 F-FDG-PET/CT) ( Fifer et al., 2011 20.

Inflammation of the periodontium associates with risk of future cardiovascular events J. Periodontol. 2021; 92 :348-358 Crossref Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ). The use of 18 F-FDG-PET/CT revealed a correlation between metabolic activity within the periodontal tissue (surrogate of periodontal inflammation) and hematopoietic tissue activity (reflecting stimulated hematopoiesis) ( Ishai et al., 2019 31. Ishai, A. ∙ Osborne, M.T. ∙ El Kholy, K. ... Periodontal disease associates with arterial inflammation via potentiation of a hematopoietic-arterial axis JACC Cardiovasc. Imaging. 2019; 12 :2271-2273 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although this clinical study is correlative, it suggests an inflammatory periodontitis-BM axis, resembling the one described in our preclinical model.
Similar to the hyper-responsive phenotype of myeloid cells from trained mice, upon ex vivo stimulation, peripheral blood neutrophils or monocytes from individuals with periodontitis respond with a higher inflammatory cytokine production than the same cells from healthy controls; this hyper-responsiveness often persists post-therapy for at least 2 months ( Ling et al., 2015 45. Ling, M.R. ∙ Chapple, I.L. ∙ Matthews, J.B. Peripheral blood neutrophil cytokine hyper-reactivity in chronic periodontitis Innate Immun. 2015; 21 :714-725 Crossref Scopus (71) PubMed Google Scholar ; Radvar et al., 2008 67.

The effect of periodontal treatment on IL-6 production of peripheral blood monocytes in aggressive periodontitis and chronic periodontitis patients Iran. J. Immunol. 2008; 5 :100-106 PubMed Google Scholar ). This apparent trained phenotype could predispose individuals with periodontitis to inflammatory comorbidities. As human periodontitis influences hematopoietic tissue activity ( Ishai et al., 2019 31. Ishai, A. ∙ Osborne, M.T. ∙ El Kholy, K. ... Periodontal disease associates with arterial inflammation via potentiation of a hematopoietic-arterial axis JACC Cardiovasc. Imaging. 2019; 12 :2271-2273 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ), the hyper-responsiveness of peripheral myeloid cells in periodontitis might result from epigenetically imprinted immune memory in inflammation-adapted BM HSPC, a concept that we, and others, have recently described in mice ( de Laval et al., 2020 14. de Laval, B. ∙ Maurizio, J. ∙ Kandalla, P.K. ...

As with individuals with periodontitis, a subset of individuals with rheumatoid arthritis under clinical remission display elevated BM metabolic activity (by 18 F-FDG-PET/CT) and a pro-inflammatory phenotype of circulating monocytes ( Bernelot Moens et al., 2016 4. Bernelot Moens, S.J. ∙ van der Valk, F.M. ∙ Strang, A.C. ... Unexpected arterial wall and cellular inflammation in patients with rheumatoid arthritis in remission using biological therapy: a cross-sectional study Arthritis Res. Ther. 2016; 18 :115 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ). These findings imply that remission of arthritis does not necessarily reduce the individual’s risk of a comorbid condition. A common underlying pathophysiology, involving inflammatory memory in the BM that sustains trained myelopoiesis, might thus be an overlooked factor contributing to the connection between distinct comorbid inflammatory disorders.
Studies in rodents have shown that experimental periodontitis promotes experimental arthritis and vice-versa; in these studies, the same animals were subjected to both disease models ( Cantley et al., 2011 7.

Aggravation of collagen-induced arthritis by orally administered Porphyromonas gingivalis through modulation of the gut microbiota and gut immune system Sci.

This approach would not allow dissecting BM-dependent mechanisms from other mechanisms contributing to the periodontitis-arthritis relationship, such as the ability of certain periodontal pathogens to cause a breakdown in immune tolerance to citrullinated epitopes, leading to the generation of arthritogenic antibodies ( Konig et al., 2016 40. Konig, M.F. ∙ Abusleme, L. ∙ Reinholdt, J. ... Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans -induced hypercitrullination links periodontal infection to autoimmunity in rheumatoid arthritis Sci. Transl.

However, such non-mutually exclusive mechanisms do not explain the bidirectional association of periodontitis and arthritis, in contrast to the mechanism reported here.
Enduring epigenetic modifications that unfold chromatin and render promoter and enhancer regions accessible to transcription factors, constitute a major pillar of the TII concept ( Fanucchi et al., 2021 19. Fanucchi, S. ∙ Domínguez-Andrés, J. ∙ Joosten, L.A.B. ... The intersection of epigenetics and metabolism in trained immunity Immunity. 2021; 54 :32-43 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (145) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this study, TII could be transferred via BMT from trained donors to naive recipient mice, whose mature myeloid cells—12 weeks post-BMT—displayed enhanced inflammatory responsiveness. Although the transmission of the trained state by BMT could involve concurrent transmission of epigenetic modifications, this has not been formally shown in the literature. Indirectly, however, several studies have suggested a key role of epigenetic memory in TII induction and maintenance. LT-HSC retain epigenetic memory of previous inflammatory challenge and this underlies their sustained myeloid bias, i.e., persistent changes in the accessibility of specific myeloid lineage enhancers, which augments the responsiveness of the respective immune genes to secondary stimuli ( de Laval et al., 2020 14. de Laval, B. ∙ Maurizio, J. ∙ Kandalla, P.K. ... C/EBPβ-dependent epigenetic memory induces trained immunity in hematopoietic stem cells Cell Stem Cell. 2020; 26 :657-674.E658 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (165) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is currently thought that, unlike repressive modifications (in particular DNA methylation), accessibility of enhancers and active histone modifications are not self-maintained in mammals; indeed, studies in dividing cell populations showing long-term and mitotically inheritable epigenetic changes have so far been attributed to DNA methylation changes and not histone modifications ( Sun and Barreiro, 2020 81. Sun, S. ∙ Barreiro, L.B. The epigenetically-encoded memory of the innate immune system Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2020; 65 :7-13 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ). Future research in dividing cells may clarify whether histone modifications are also epigenetically transmissible. In this regard, certain chromatin accessibility changes are transmitted from HSPC to progeny cells along differentiation trajectories ( Buenrostro et al., 2018 6. Buenrostro, J.D. ∙ Corces, M.R. ∙ Lareau, C.A. ... Integrated single-cell analysis maps the continuous regulatory landscape of human hematopoietic differentiation Cell. 2018; 173 :1535-1548.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (372) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, epigenetic changes in the form of histone modifications were shown to be passed on to the mouse offspring ( Siklenka et al., 2015 77. Siklenka, K. ∙ Erkek, S. ∙ Godmann, M. ... Disruption of histone methylation in developing sperm impairs offspring health transgenerationally Science. 2015; 350 :aab2006 Crossref Scopus (367) PubMed Google Scholar ). Transgenerational transmission of various immune traits including TII, attributable to sustained epigenetic memory, has been shown recently in mice ( Bomans et al., 2018 5. Bomans, K. ∙ Schenz, J. ∙ Tamulyte, S. ... Paternal sepsis induces alterations of the sperm methylome and dampens offspring immune responses – an animal study Clin.

Based on our findings, an inflammatory disease could modulate TII in the BM in a manner that not only aggravates the pre-existing disease but can also increase susceptibility to a distinct inflammatory condition. Such unified conceptual framework could also provide a platform for therapeutic interventions targeting inflammatory comorbidities. Our data suggest that systemic inhibition of IL-1-induced signaling may potentially block the maladaptive training of BM progenitors and thereby disrupt a common mechanism for inflammatory comorbidities. In this regard, it might be argued that the successful application of IL-1β blockade in the CANTOS trial for the treatment of atherosclerosis ( Ridker et al., 2017 70. Ridker, P.M. ∙ Everett, B.M. ∙ Thuren, T. ... Antiinflammatory therapy with canakinumab for atherosclerotic disease N. Engl. J. Med. 2017; 377 :1119-1131 Crossref Scopus (5953) PubMed Google Scholar ) might, in part, have resulted from the inhibition of TII in the BM. In conclusion, our findings establish the principle that maladaptive innate immune training of myelopoiesis underlies inflammatory comorbidities, paving the way for their treatment in a holistic manner.
Our findings have linked experimental periodontitis to maladaptive BM-mediated TII, which underlies inflammatory comorbidities. Nevertheless, our study has several limitations. Despite initial evidence for an inflammatory periodontitis-BM axis in humans and for a trained phenotype of myeloid cells from individuals with periodontitis, formal evidence for periodontitis-induced maladaptive TII in humans may require studying hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients. Thus, future investigations of the transmissibility of inflammatory memory to HSCT recipients from donors with or without periodontitis would confer increased clinical relevance to our study. Such study would prompt clinicians to take inflammatory memory into consideration when selecting appropriate donors for BMT. In most of the experiments (and all functional assays), LIP lasted for 21 days to mimic chronic periodontitis in humans, although shorter durations (e.g., 7 days) were also used to determine early effects of LIP on modulating myelopoiesis. We cannot rule out the possibility that epigenetic changes seen after 21 days of LIP and 14 days resolution might differ from those occurring at earlier time points and whether such earlier changes might also contribute to a trained phenotype. Our findings that a maladaptive trained phenotype was transmissible via BMT in a HSPC-specific and IL-1-dependent manner indicated that IL-1 is critical for induction of a long-lasting trained phenotype with detrimental consequences in inflammatory disease. We have not determined if IL-1 signaling shapes the epigenetically imprinted inflammatory memory associated with a myeloid differentiation bias in trained LT-HSC; this question should be studied in the future. Moreover, we cannot exclude the possibility that IL-1β may cooperate (or even synergize) with other as yet unidentified inflammatory factors, thus warranting additional mechanistic investigations. Despite the de facto transmission of the TII phenotype via HSC transplantation, the underlying molecular epigenetic mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Finally, at this point, we do not know how long a maladaptive trained phenotype would last, a question that must be carefully addressed in the future.

C57BL/6 and congenic C57BL/6.SJL CD45.1 + male mice (B6.SJL- Ptprc a Pepc b /BoyJ) were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory. Mice with tamoxifen-inducible deletion of the IL-1 receptor specifically in HSPC, designated HSC-SCL-Cre-ERT/ Il1r1 fl/fl (hereafter referred to as Il1r1 HSPC-KO mice) were generated by crossing using Il1r1 fl/fl mice (Stock # 028398; Jackson Laboratory) and HSC-SCL-Cre-ERT mice ( Göthert et al., 2005 26.

Göthert, University Hospital Essen). To induce Il1r1 deletion, Il1r1 HSPC-KO mice were administered tamoxifen (0.3 mg/g body weight by oral gavage) two times within 72h, followed by feeding the mice with tamoxifen-containing (0.5 mg/g) diet for 18 days. Mice were maintained in individually ventilated cages under specific pathogen-free conditions on a standard 12-h light/dark cycle. Food and water were provided ad libitum. The mice were 8- to 10-week-old at the start of the experiments. Animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the University of Pennsylvania and were performed in compliance with institutional, state, and federal policies.
Ligature-induced periodontitis (LIP) simulates human periodontitis by generating a local biofilm-retentive milieu leading to inflammation and bone loss ( Abe and Hajishengallis, 2013 1.

Host defense against oral microbiota by bone-damaging T cells Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :701 Crossref Scopus (208) PubMed Google Scholar ). To study the effect of experimental periodontitis on BM hematopoietic progenitor cells, LIP was performed in mice as previously described ( Abe and Hajishengallis, 2013 1. Abe, T. ∙ Hajishengallis, G. Optimization of the ligature-induced periodontitis model in mice J. Immunol. Methods. 2013; 394 :49-54 Crossref Scopus (347) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, 5-0 silk ligatures were tied around the left and right maxillary second molar teeth for time intervals specified in the figure legends (up to 21 days). The same teeth were left unligated in control mice. In some experiments, the placement of ligatures was followed by their removal (for 14 days in most experiments) to enable inflammation resolution ( Kourtzelis et al., 2019 41. Kourtzelis, I. ∙ Li, X. ∙ Mitroulis, I. ... DEL-1 promotes macrophage efferocytosis and clearance of inflammation Nat.

The DEL-1/β3 integrin axis promotes regulatory T cell responses during inflammation resolution J. Clin. Invest. 2020; 130 :6261-6277 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ) prior to BM analysis. In a subset of these experiments, mice during resolution were subjected to a secondary challenge, namely Escherichia coli O111:B4 LPS (InVivogen) which was injected i.p. at 1.5 mg/kg body weight, modeling bacteremia. The mice were euthanized 72h after the LPS injection for analysis. To determine ligature-induced bone loss, the 5-day standard LIP model was used, in which only the left maxillary second molar was ligated, whereas the contralateral (right) molar tooth was left unligated to serve as baseline control for measuring bone loss as we previously described ( Abe and Hajishengallis, 2013 1.

Collagen antibody-induced arthritis was induced in mice by i.v. (retro-orbital) injection of 1.5 mg arthritogenic monoclonal antibodies (5-clone collagen antibody cocktail; Chondrex) ( Khachigian, 2006 37. Khachigian, L.M. Collagen antibody-induced arthritis Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1 :2512-2516 Crossref Scopus (125) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2021 85. Wang, H. ∙ Li, X. ∙ Kajikawa, T. ... Stromal cell-derived DEL-1 inhibits Tfh cell activation and inflammatory arthritis J. Clin. Invest. 2021; 131 :e150578 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ). Three days later, mice were injected i.p. with 50 μg of LPS. Clinical symptoms of arthritis were daily evaluated visually for each paw using a semiquantitative scoring system graded on a scale of 0–4 per paw ( Khachigian, 2006 37. Khachigian, L.M. Collagen antibody-induced arthritis Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1 :2512-2516 Crossref Scopus (125) PubMed Google Scholar ) by a blinded procedure: 0 for normal; 1 for mild redness, slight swelling of ankle or wrist; 2 for moderate swelling of ankle or wrist; 3 for severe swelling, including some digits, ankle and foot; 4 for maximally inflamed joint. The clinical score for each mouse was the sum of the 4 paw scores for a maximum score of 16. Hind ankle joint thickness was measured by using J 15 pocket dial thickness gauge (Käfer).
For BM single-cell suspension preparation, femoral bones of C57BL/6 mice were flushed with ice-cold PBS (Gibco) supplemented with 5% FBS (Gibco). Cells were forced through 70-μm nylon cell strainer to get single-cell suspension for further flow cytometric analysis and FACS cell sorting. To isolate BM mature neutrophils, BM cells were flushed from femurs of C57BL/6 mice subjected to LIP for 14 days. Upon lysis of red blood cells with ACK Lysing Buffer (Gibco), the cells were centrifuged in 62% Percoll gradient (GE Healthcare). The sharp interface atop the 62% Percoll (containing immature cells and non-granulocytic lineages) was carefully removed and discarded, whereas the pellet (mature neutrophils) was collected. To collect BM extracellular fluid, mice femurs were flushed with 500 μl ice-cold PBS (Gibco) and the supernatant was harvested after centrifugation at 500 x g for 5 min at 4°C. Serum was collected after retrobulbar bleeding. Specifically, collected whole blood was left undisturbed at room temperature for 30 mins and the clot was removed by centrifugation at 2,000 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C followed by collection of the supernatant serum.
Mice subjected to LIP and a secondary challenge with LPS (see above) were euthanized and lung lobes were dissected after tracheal and intracardial perfusion with cold PBS. Lung tissues were then cut into 1-mm 2 pieces with scissor and digested in freshly prepared digestion medium consisting of 2 mg/ml collagenase IV (Invitrogen) in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen). The digestion was performed at 37°C with shaking at 100 rpm for 1h and was stopped by addition of EDTA (Invitrogen) at a final concentration of 5mM. Cells were forced through 100-μm nylon cell strainer and subjected to 40% Percoll density gradient centrifugation (GE Healthcare) to remove debris. The cell pellet was resuspended in ACK Lysing Buffer (Gibco) for lysis of red blood cells. Cells were washed and resuspended for immunofluorescence staining and flow cytometric analysis.
To isolate splenic neutrophils and monocytes, splenocytes were incubated with biotinylated anti-mouse Ly6G antibody (clone 1A8; Biolegend) followed by anti-biotin microbeads from Miltenyi Biotec. Neutrophils were positively selected using LS columns on the magnetic field of QuadroMACS™ Separator according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Miltenyi Biotec). For isolating splenic monocytes, neutrophils were first removed by negative selection for Ly6G + cells and then monocytes were obtained by positive selection for Ly6C + (clone HK1.4; Biolegend) cells as we previously described ( Kalafati et al., 2020 33. Kalafati, L. ∙ Kourtzelis, I. ∙ Schulte-Schrepping, J. ... Innate immune training of granulopoiesis promotes anti-tumor activity Cell. 2020; 183 :771-785.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (270) PubMed Google Scholar ).

Cells sorting was performed on a FACSARIA™ instrument (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems, USA).
To generate BM chimeras, a total of 2x10 6 BM cells from C57BL/6 (CD45.2 + ) mice, or from CD45.2 + Il1r1 HSPC-KO and littermate controls were transplanted (via a single retro-orbital injection) into lethally (9.5 Gy) irradiated B6/SJL (CD45.1 + ) mice. Twelve weeks after BM transplantation, the recipient mice were subjected to treatments and/or analyses as described in results and Figure legends. The CD45.1/CD45.2 congenic system was also used in competitive BM chimeras, e.g ., to assess lineage output of LT-HSC in transplanted mice. Sorted LT-HSC (100 cells per recipient) isolated from the BM of CD45.2 + mice (which were subjected to 21-day LIP and 14-day resolution or were left untreated for 35 days) were retro-orbitally transferred into lethally (9.5 Gy) irradiated naïve B6/SJL (CD45.1) recipients along with 5x10 5 CD45.1 + competitor cells. The percentage of different CD45.2 + cell populations was assessed at 4, 8, 12 and 16 weeks post transplantation in the blood of recipient mice, and at 16 weeks post transplantation (end point) in the BM of recipient mice.
In additional competitive BM chimera experiments, sorted LT-HSC (total or further sorted into CD41 + LT-HSC and CD41 − LT-HSC) isolated from the BM of CD45.2 + mice (which were subjected to 21-day LIP and 14-day resolution or were left untreated for 35 days) were retro-orbitally transferred (200 cells per recipient) into lethally (9.5 Gy) irradiated naïve B6/SJL (CD45.1) recipients along with 8x10 5 CD45.1 + competitor cells. In all BMT experiments, irradiated recipient mice were kept on antibiotics-containing water for 2 weeks after irradiation. Complete blood count (CBC) test was performed using Sysmex XT-2000iV Hematology Analyzer.
The concentrations of mouse IL-6, IL-1β, IFN-γ, IL-12p70 and IL-10 in BM fluid and serum were measured using mouse ELISA kits (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Mouse G-CSF was measured using ELISA kit from RayBiotech, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For in vitro stimulation of mature neutrophils from the BM, isolated mature neutrophils were stimulated with different concentration of mouse recombinant G-CSF (R&D Systems) for 24h. The supernatant was collected for measuring IL-1β concentration using mouse ELISA kit (Invitrogen). For in vitro re-stimulation of splenic monocytes and neutrophils with LPS, isolated splenic monocytes and neutrophils were seeded into 24-wells plates and stimulated with 10ng/ml of E. coli O111:B4 LPS (InVivogen) for 24h. The supernatant was collected for measuring IL-6 and TNF concentration using mouse ELISA kit (Invitrogen).
Total cellular RNA was isolated from mouse tissues and sorted BM cells using Trizol (Invitrogen). For real-time PCR, 500 ng of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using High-Capacity RNA-to-cDNA Kit (Applied Biosystems) and real-time PCR with cDNA was performed using the Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System, according to the manufacturer's protocol (Applied Biosystems). TaqMan probes and gene-specific primers for detection and quantification of murine genes investigated in this study were purchased from Thermo-Fisher Scientific ( Table S1 ). Data were analyzed using the comparative (ΔΔCt) method and were normalized to Gapdh mRNA. In LIP experiments assessing gingival cytokine mRNA expression in ligated sites, the data are shown as fold change relative to the contralateral unligated control sites (baseline), set as 1.
Harvested joints were fixed in 4% buffered formaldehyde. The bones were subsequently decalcified, embedded in Optimal Cutting Temperature (OCT) media and sectioned at 10-μm thickness for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) or Safranin-O staining (ScienCell) ( Wang et al., 2021 85. Wang, H. ∙ Li, X. ∙ Kajikawa, T. ... Stromal cell-derived DEL-1 inhibits Tfh cell activation and inflammatory arthritis J. Clin. Invest. 2021; 131 :e150578 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ).
LSK from the BM of mice subjected to 7-day LIP or unligated control mice were sorted using a FACSAria™ sorter. Three mice were pooled for each replicate. Total RNA was extracted by Trizol (Invitrogen) and DNA was removed by using TURBO DNA-free Kit (Invitrogen). PolyA-selected mRNA libraries were generated following the manufacturer’s protocols (BGI). Samples were sequenced on BGISEQ platform to generate 100 bp paired-end reads with an average depth of 45.0 M reads per sample. Clean reads were mapped to the mouse genome (Ensembl assembly GRCm38) using Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) ( Dobin et al., 2013 17. Dobin, A. ∙ Davis, C.A. ∙ Schlesinger, F. ... STAR: ultrafast universal RNA-seq aligner Bioinformatics. 2013; 29 :15-21 Crossref Scopus (25615) PubMed Google Scholar ) with default settings after filtering low-quality, adaptor-polluted and high content of unknown base (N) reads. The average mapping ratio with reference genome was 96.46%, the average mapping ratio with gene was 80.83%. A total of 16,403 genes were detected. Most transcripts were completely covered, and reads were evenly distributed throughout the transcript.
LSK from the BM of mice which were subjected to 21-day LIP and 14-day resolution, or were left untreated for 35 days, were sorted using a FACSAria™ sorter. The cells were resuspended in 1X PBS containing 0.04% BSA (400 μg/ml) and processed with Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3ʹ Kit v3.1, 16 rxns (10x Genomics) at the CAG Sequencing Core of Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, USA. Cell suspensions contained more than 90% viable cells as determined by microscopy. The cell numbers were adjusted to 700–1200 cells per μl and added to 10x Chromium RT mix to achieve loading target numbers of around 20000 cells. cDNA synthesis was performed per the manufacturer’s instructions, and library preparation and sequencing (Novaseq SP reagent kit; 100 cycles) were performed using the Novaseq 6000 platform (Illumina) per the manufacturer’s instructions.
Mouse LSK and GMP were sorted as described above. Nuclei isolation for single-cell ATAC sequencing was performed according to the “Nuclei Isolation for Single Cell ATAC Sequencing demonstrated protocol” (10x Genomics). Briefly, after sorting, cells were centrifuged at 300 rcf for 5 min at 4°C and washed once with PBS with 0.04% BSA. One hundred μL of chilled Lysis buffer (10mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10mM NaCl, 3mM MgCl2, 0.1% Tween-20, 0.1% Nonidet P40 Substrate, 0.01% Digitonin, 1% BSA in nuclease free water) was added to the pellet and cells were incubated on ice for 2 min for LSK and 3 min for GMP. Cells were washed once with 1 ml of wash buffer (10mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10mM NaCl, 3mM MgCl2, 0.1% Tween-20, 1% BSA in nuclease free water) and concentrated by centrifugation at 500 rcf for 5 min at 4°C. Nuclei in pellet were suspended in 1x Nuclei Buffer (10x Genomics); nuclei quality and concentration were determined using a microscope and a Countess II FL Automated Cell Counter (Thermo Fisher). Nuclei suspension was then diluted and used according to the Chromium Single Cell ATAC Reagent Kits protocol (10x Genomics) Briefly, nuclei suspension was mixed with the tagmentation mix and incubated for 1 hr at 37°C. After mixing with a barcoding mix, the nuclei were loaded into a 10x chip H together with barcoded beads and partitioning oil (Chromium Next GEM Chip H Single Cell Kit v1.1, Chromium Next GEM Single Cell ATAC Library & Gel Bead Kit v1.1, 10x Genomics) and encapsulated using the Chromium controller (10x Genomics). The Gel Bead-In EMulsions (GEMs) was transferred into a PCR tube and amplified for 12 cycles in a thermocycler. The barcoded DNA was purified and subjected to an index PCR for 11 cycles. The library amplification was assessed using fragment analyzer (Agilent, NGS High Sensitivity Fragment Analysis Kit) and sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 system using S1 Reagent Kit v1.5 (100 cycles) in PE mode (50x8x16x50 read lengths), at a median depth of 7500 fragments/cell.
Reads count in each gene were calculated by htseq-count package. Subsequently, differential gene expression was analyzed using DEGseq2 ( Love et al., 2014 47. Love, M.I. ∙ Huber, W. ∙ Anders, S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2 Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :550 Crossref Scopus (45395) PubMed Google Scholar ) and significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were defined by FDR-adjusted P value < 0.05 in the LIP-subjected group relative to their expression in the control group. Significantly up- or down- regulated DEGs were subjected to Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analyses using PANTHER (Protein ANalysis THrough Evolutionary Relationships) ( http://www.pantherdb.org ) and KEGG pathway analysis ( https://www.genome.jp/kegg/kaas/ ) with default background and default threshold. Significantly enriched Biological Process GO terms and KEGG pathways were defined by FDR-adjusted P value <0.05. DEGs were also subjected to upstream regulator analysis using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, QIAGEN Redwood City http://qiagen.com/ingenuity ). Top significantly activated transcription factors and upstream regulators are shown. Volcano plot, principal component analysis (PCA) plot, bar plots and heat maps were generated by customized R script. Overlapping genes, e.g ., Csfr1 and Itgb3 , in heatmaps of two different GO terms are shown in both terms.
Cell Ranger 3.0.2 ( https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/ overview/welcome ) was used to process raw paired-end sequencing data. Briefly, Cell Ranger mkfastq pipeline was used to demultiplex sample index reads to generate FASTQ files for each sequencing library, and then raw reads were aligned to the UCSC mouse reference genome (mm10) using STAR aligner with default parameters. Subsequently, data filtering, normalization, scaling, and Principal component analysis (PCA) were performed using the R package Seurat version 4.0.3 ( Stuart et al., 2019 79. Stuart, T. ∙ Butler, A. ∙ Hoffman, P. ... Comprehensive integration of single-cell data Cell. 2019; 177 :1888-1902.e21 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (6793) PubMed Google Scholar ) and dimensionality reduction and clustering were further done by Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) analysis. Low-quality cells and possible cell doublets were filtered out using the following criteria: (i) number of detected genes between 200 and 2500, and (ii) percentage of UMIs derived from mitochondrial genes below 5%. The UMI counts were normalized by library size factors. As a result, Cell Ranger recovered total 7051 (NL) and 8206 (LSK-21dL/14dR) LSK. Genes differentially expressed across clusters were identified using likelihood ratio test. GO enrichment analysis of cluster 7-specific markers were performed using PANTHER. Heat maps and bubble plots were generated by customized R script.
Cell Ranger ATAC 1.2.0 ( https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-atac/software/overview/welcome ) was used to process raw sequencing data. Cell Ranger ATAC's pipelines was used to align reads, generate peak matrix with single-cell accessibility counts and fragment file with all unique fragments across all single cells, using ‘refdata-cellranger-atac-mm10-1.2.0’ from the 10X Genomics website ( https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-atac/software/downloads/ ) as reference genome file. The following analysis of the scATAC-seq data was performed using the R package Seurat and Signac ( Stuart et al., 2019 79. Stuart, T. ∙ Butler, A. ∙ Hoffman, P. ... Comprehensive integration of single-cell data Cell. 2019; 177 :1888-1902.e21 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (6793) PubMed Google Scholar , 2020 80. Stuart, T. ∙ Srivastava, A. ∙ Lareau, C. ... Multimodal single-cell chromatin analysis with Signac bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). Briefly, a chromatin accessibility matrix was created by merging fragment files from 4 samples and filtering out peaks with peak width larger than 10000 bp or smaller than 500 bp. Next, Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) based on latent semantic indexing (LSI) was generated to visualize the data structure in the two-dimensional space (designated LSK-NL, LSK-21dL/14dR, GMP-NL and GMP-21dL/14dR). Smart local moving (SLM) approach implemented in the R package Seurat ( Stuart et al., 2019 79. Stuart, T. ∙ Butler, A. ∙ Hoffman, P. ... Comprehensive integration of single-cell data Cell. 2019; 177 :1888-1902.e21 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (6793) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used to cluster the single-cell accessibility profiles. A logistic regression framework was used for differentially accessible regions (DAR) analysis (abs(Log 2 FC) ≥ 0.2, P < 0.05). GO enrichment analysis of the treatment-specific DAR of LSK were performed using PANTHER (Protein ANalysis THrough Evolutionary Relationships) ( http://www.pantherdb.org ). Additionally, a gene activity matrix was created to quantify the activity of each gene by assessing the chromatin accessibility using Signac package. For motif enrichment analysis, an ArchR project was created using ArchR v1.0.1 ( Granja et al., 2021 27. Granja, J.M. ∙ Corces, M.R. ∙ Pierce, S.E. ... ArchR is a scalable software package for integrative single-cell chromatin accessibility analysis Nat. Genet. 2021; 53 :403-411 Crossref Scopus (380) PubMed Google Scholar ), and peak regions were annotated with homer motif set. Moreover, the peakAnnoEnrichment function implemented in ArchR was used to identify the enriched transcription factor binding motifs based on the treatment-specific DARs in LSK with FDR<0.01 and log 2 FC ≥ 1, followed by GO enrichment analysis using PANTHER. A cellular trajectory was constructed spanning from LSK over cluster C9 to GMP using Monocle 3 and Cicero tool ( Cao et al., 2019 8. Cao, J. ∙ Spielmann, M. ∙ Qiu, X. ... The single-cell transcriptional landscape of mammalian organogenesis Nature. 2019; 566 :496-502 Crossref Scopus (1641) PubMed Google Scholar ; Pliner et al., 2018 64. Pliner, H.A. ∙ Packer, J.S. ∙ McFaline-Figueroa, J.L. ... Cicero predicts cis-regulatory DNA interactions from single-cell chromatin accessibility data Mol. Cell. 2018; 71 :858-871.e8 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (358) PubMed Google Scholar ), based on the chromatin accessibility.
After confirming normality, data were analyzed with two-tailed unpaired Student’s t test (comparison of only two groups) or one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s multiple-comparisons test (when comparing more than two groups). In a few instances (comparison of only two groups) where data did not follow normal distribution, the non-parametric two-tailed Mann-Whitney U-test was used. Two-way repeated measures ANOVA and Sidak's multiple-comparisons test was used to analyze data in repeated-measures designs. All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software (version 8.4.3; GraphPad Inc). P values <0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.
