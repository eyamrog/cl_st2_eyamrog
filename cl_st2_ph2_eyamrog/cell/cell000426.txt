Title: A local regulatory T cell feedback circuit maintains immune homeostasis by pruning self-activated T cells


Abstract: Summary

A fraction of mature T cells can be activated by peripheral self-antigens, potentially eliciting host autoimmunity. We investigated homeostatic control of self-activated T cells within unperturbed tissue environments by combining high-resolution multiplexed and volumetric imaging with computational modeling. In lymph nodes, self-activated T cells produced interleukin (IL)-2, which enhanced local regulatory T cell (Treg) proliferation and inhibitory functionality. The resulting micro-domains reciprocally constrained inputs required for damaging effector responses, including CD28 co-stimulation and IL-2 signaling, constituting a negative feedback circuit. Due to these local constraints, self-activated T cells underwent transient clonal expansion, followed by rapid death (“pruning”). Computational simulations and experimental manipulations revealed the feedback machinery’s quantitative limits: modest reductions in Treg micro-domain density or functionality produced non-linear breakdowns in control, enabling self-activated T cells to subvert pruning. This fine-tuned, paracrine feedback process not only enforces immune homeostasis but also establishes a sharp boundary between autoimmune and host-protective T cell responses.

Section: Introduction

To promote host defense, αβ-T lymphocytes undergo clonal expansion and differentiate into effectors that produce inflammatory cytokines or cytotoxins. This process is initiated by productive interactions between the T cell receptor (TCR) and antigenic peptides bound to major histocompatibility complex-encoded molecules (pMHCs), which are displayed by antigen presenting cells (APCs). Due to a quasi-random gene recombination process, each T cell harbors a structurally unique TCR with distinct binding specificity. The net result is a repertoire of cells that can recognize and respond to a broad range of peptides ( Vrisekoop et al., 2014 106. Vrisekoop, N. ∙ Monteiro, J.P. ∙ Mandl, J.N. ... Revisiting thymic positive selection and the mature T cell repertoire for antigen Immunity. 2014; 41 :181-190 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although this receptor diversity protects the host against disparate threats, it also introduces significant risk: many TCRs generated during lymphocyte development will react strongly to self-pMHCs ( Xing and Hogquist, 2012 110. Xing, Y. ∙ Hogquist, K.A. T-cell tolerance: central and peripheral Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2012; 4 :a006957 Crossref Scopus (194) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because no genetic mechanisms exist to limit this self-reactivity, T cell-extrinsic control systems are required to prevent autoimmunity.
Initial control occurs within the thymus, filtering developing T cells based on their reactivity toward self-pMHCs. T cells that react modestly receive survival signals and mature (“positive selection”), whereas those that fail to react sufficiently undergo apoptosis (“death by neglect”). Many developing T cells are also eliminated by apoptosis if they react too strongly (“negative selection”). Although efficient, the latter process is not absolute: some overtly self-reactive T cells escape elimination, mature, and exit the thymus ( Klein et al., 2014 54. Klein, L. ∙ Kyewski, B. ∙ Allen, P.M. ... Positive and negative selection of the T cell repertoire: what thymocytes see (and don’t see) Nat. Rev.

Tolerance is established in polyclonal CD4(+) T cells by distinct mechanisms, according to self-peptide expression patterns Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17 :187-195 Crossref Scopus (106) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Incomplete negative selection necessitates auxiliary control within secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs), critical hubs that initiate T cell effector responses ( Baptista et al., 2019 11. Baptista, A.P. ∙ Gola, A. ∙ Huang, Y. ...

In the absence of infection or malignancy, APCs within SLOs—predominantly dendritic cells (DCs)—display an abundance of self-pMHCs that could stimulate ineffectively filtered T cells, potentially generating tissue-damaging effectors. To prevent this outcome, SLOs contain specialized CD4 + T cells, known as Tregs, which restrain T cell responses to self-antigens ( Fontenot et al., 2003 34.

Notably, loss of Tregs precipitates rapid autoimmunity in mice and humans ( Bennett et al., 2001 13. Bennett, C.L. ∙ Christie, J. ∙ Ramsdell, F. ...

Regulatory T cells prevent catastrophic autoimmunity throughout the lifespan of mice Nat. Immunol. 2007; 8 :191-197 Crossref Scopus (1224) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Two models could explain Treg operations in SLOs: (1) preventing T cell activation toward self-pMHC, or (2) constraining T cells in response to their activation by self-pMHC. The latter constitutes a negative feedback design, which often confers a system with robustness toward noise ( Becskei and Serrano, 2000 12. Becskei, A. ∙ Serrano, L. Engineering stability in gene networks by autoregulation Nature. 2000; 405 :590-593 Crossref Scopus (1115) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this scenario, T cell activation by self-pMHC would represent “noise” sensed by Tregs and subsequently suppressed, restoring the system to a steady state. Although Tregs can prevent T cell activation, supporting model 1, this form of proactive control is incomplete ( Akkaya et al., 2019 3. Akkaya, B. ∙ Oya, Y. ∙ Akkaya, M. ...

Immunol. 2006; 7 :83-92 Crossref Scopus (645) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, we recently documented activated CD4 + T cells that produced the cytokine interleukin 2 (IL-2) under homeostatic conditions ( Liu et al., 2015 60. Liu, Z. ∙ Gerner, M.Y. ∙ Van Panhuys, N. ... Immune homeostasis enforced by co-localized effector and regulatory T cells Nature. 2015; 528 :225-230 Crossref Scopus (169) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The negative feedback model is conceptually attractive but lacks experimental support. Tregs possess multiple molecular mechanisms that could constrain T cells activated by self-antigens (“self-activated T cells”) ( Shevach, 2009 85. Shevach, E.M. Mechanisms of foxp3+ T regulatory cell-mediated suppression Immunity. 2009; 30 :636-645 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1276) PubMed Google Scholar ). Whether these mechanisms operate concurrently, sequentially, or opportunistically is unknown. Moreover, the terminal fate of a self-activated T cell constrained by a potential feedback process is difficult to predict. Last, if Tregs do exert feedback, the margin for error before a self-activated T cell escapes control requires quantitative assessment. A framework integrating these distinct features is lacking, precluding the development of models that can accurately predict the emergence of autoimmune disease ( Marson et al., 2015 65. Marson, A. ∙ Housley, W.J. ∙ Hafler, D.A. Genetic basis of autoimmunity J. Clin. Invest. 2015; 125 :2234-2241 Crossref Scopus (68) PubMed Google Scholar ).
By combining quantitative tissue imaging and computational modeling, we identified a negative feedback circuit that limits incipient autoimmunity. Self-activated CD4 + T cells secreted interleukin (IL)-2, which triggered paracrine signaling in neighboring Tregs. As a result, Tregs increased in local density and functionality, constraining inputs required to sustain self-activated T cell proliferation and survival. This feedback machinery is fine-tuned by the local density and functionality of Tregs surrounding an activated CD4 + T cell. Our findings reveal an extra-thymic filtering process that continuously removes self-activated T cells from the host, ultimately preserving immune homeostasis.

Section: Results

We previously identified rare CD4 + T cells producing IL-2 in healthy hosts, suggesting that Tregs likely operate in a negative feedback mode, rather than pre-empting responses against self ( Liu et al., 2015 60. Liu, Z. ∙ Gerner, M.Y. ∙ Van Panhuys, N. ... Immune homeostasis enforced by co-localized effector and regulatory T cells Nature. 2015; 528 :225-230 Crossref Scopus (169) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, this cytokine measurement underestimates the number of self-activated T cells due to limited detection sensitivity. As an alternative, we exploited the fact that T cells express inhibitory receptors, particularly programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), in response to sufficient TCR signaling ( Hochweller and Anderton, 2005 42. Hochweller, K. ∙ Anderton, S.M. Kinetics of costimulatory molecule expression by T cells and dendritic cells during the induction of tolerance versus immunity in vivo Eur. J. Immunol. 2005; 35 :1086-1096 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). We combined immunostaining, confocal microscopy, and computer vision techniques to assess PD-1 expression in lymph nodes (LNs) of healthy C57BL/6 mice ( Figures S1 A–S1C; Gerner et al., 2012 39. Gerner, M.Y. ∙ Kastenmuller, W. ∙ Ifrim, I. ... Histo-cytometry: a method for highly multiplex quantitative tissue imaging analysis applied to dendritic cell subset microanatomy in lymph nodes Immunity. 2012; 37 :364-376 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (244) PubMed Google Scholar ). To distinguish between CD4 + Foxp3 + Tregs (Tregs) and conventional CD4 + Foxp3 − T cells (CD4 + T cells), we included antibodies directed against CD3, CD4, and Foxp3 ( Figures 1 A and S1 B). Among paracortical CD4 + T cells, PD-1 expression ranged from undetectable to highly enriched on individual cells ( Figures 1 A, 1B, and S1 C).
To test whether the PD-1 expression was due to TCR-mediated stimulation, we injected animals with a blocking directed against I-A b , the MHC class II molecule in C57BL/6 mice ( Bhattacharya et al., 1981 15. Bhattacharya, A. ∙ Dorf, M.E. ∙ Springer, T.A. A shared alloantigenic determinant on Ia antigens encoded by the I-A and I-E subregions: evidence for I region gene duplication J. Immunol. 1981; 127 :2488-2495 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Because TCR-MHCII interactions also control CD4 + T cell transit times through the LN, we first trapped T cells in the LN using CD62L blocking antibodies and FTY720 ( Gallatin et al., 1983 38. Gallatin, W.M. ∙ Weissman, I.L. ∙ Butcher, E.C. A cell-surface molecule involved in organ-specific homing of lymphocytes Nature. 1983; 304 :30-34 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Mandl et al., 2012 63. Mandl, J.N. ∙ Liou, R. ∙ Klauschen, F. ... Quantification of lymph node transit times reveals differences in antigen surveillance strategies of naive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109 :18036-18041 Crossref Scopus (93) PubMed Google Scholar ; Matloubian et al., 2004 66. Matloubian, M. ∙ Lo, C.G. ∙ Cinamon, G. ... Lymphocyte egress from thymus and peripheral lymphoid organs is dependent on S1P receptor 1 Nature. 2004; 427 :355-360 Crossref Scopus (1899) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although trapping alone did not affect PD-1 expression, trapping combined with I-A b blocking antibodies reduced PD-1 expression by ∼45% in CD4 + T cells and ∼50% in Tregs after 24 h ( Figures 1 B and S1 D).
Exogenous food proteins, commensal organisms, or self-proteins could account for CD4 + T cell stimulation in the absence of infection. To examine the first two possibilities, we harvested skin draining LNs, which lack presentation of food antigens, from germ-free (GF) mice, which lack commensal organisms. When compared to equivalent LNs from specific-pathogen-free (SPF) mice, PD-1 expression was similar in CD4 + T cells ( Figure 1 B). Thus, PD-1 expression marked CD4 + T cells activated by self-antigens during homeostasis.
The negative feedback model requires Tregs and self-activated T cells to reside near one another. Therefore, we assessed the spatial relationship between both cell types in the LN paracortex ( Figure 1 A). We first discretized PD-1 expression, setting a threshold that encompassed the top 2% of the distribution (“PD-1 + ”) ( Figures 1 B and S1 C). We then computed a spatial density estimation, which revealed multiple Treg “micro-domains” throughout the paracortex. Notably, self-activated PD-1 + CD4 + T cells localized within these Treg-dense micro-domains ( Figure 1 C). To quantify this observation, we treated each PD-1 + CD4 + T cell as an origin point and computed the surrounding Treg density in three-dimensional space (λ Treg ). Compared to randomly sampled PD-1 − CD4 + T cells, λ Treg was selectively enriched around PD-1 + CD4 + T cells, both in SPF and GF animals ( Figures 1 D and S1 E).
To exert negative feedback, Tregs in micro-domains should alter their functional state in response to signals from self-activated T cells. This prediction was tested using multiplexed imaging to simultaneously measure cell-to-cell variation across parameters previously implicated in Treg function ( Figure 2 A; Buszko and Shevach, 2020 19. Buszko, M. ∙ Shevach, E.M. Control of regulatory T cell homeostasis Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2020; 67 :18-26 Crossref Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ). The measurements were then subjected to unsupervised hierarchical clustering, which revealed four groups of cells ( Figure 2 B). Cluster 1 comprised Tregs greater than one standard deviation (SD) below the mean of most parameter distributions (“non-activated”). By contrast, clusters 3 and 4 generally comprised cells with inverse phenotypes (“activated”), likely corresponding to “effector Tregs” ( Levine et al., 2014 56.

Continuous T cell receptor signals maintain a functional regulatory T cell pool Immunity. 2014; 41 :722-736 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cluster 2 was more heterogeneous. Consistent with the negative feedback model, Tregs within clusters 3 and 4, but not 1 and 2, were selectively enriched near PD-1 + CD4 + T cells compared to randomly sampled PD-1 − CD4 + T cells ( Figure 2 C).
Among candidate signals that could drive a negative feedback response from Tregs, IL-2 stood out: CD4 + T cells rapidly produce this cytokine following activation, Tregs require IL-2 for optimal function yet paradoxically do not produce it, and rare CD4 + T cells are the predominant source of IL-2 during homeostasis ( Almeida et al., 2006 5.

Med. 2005; 201 :723-735 Crossref Scopus (915) PubMed Google Scholar ). To explore whether IL-2 secreted by self-activated T cells initiated Treg feedback, we first examined if CD4 + PD-1 + T cells produced IL-2 in vitro . Indeed, a significant fraction of activated CD4 + T cells expressed PD-1 while simultaneously secreting cytokine ( Figures S1 F and S1G). Endogenous CD4 + IL-2 + T cells also exhibited elevated PD-1 expression in situ ( Figures S1 H and S1I). Most importantly, CD4 + PD-1 + T cells in LNs were often surrounded by Tregs containing pSTAT5, a hallmark of signaling downstream of the IL-2 receptor complex ( Figures 2 B, S1 H, and S1I). Thus, many CD4 + PD-1 + T cells were producing or had recently produced IL-2 in LNs of healthy hosts.
Upon sensing paracrine IL-2, neighboring Tregs should enhance their local functionality, accounting in part for their unique phenotypes in micro-domains. We tested this possibility by administering IL-2 blocking antibodies ( Spangler et al., 2015 92. Spangler, J.B. ∙ Tomala, J. ∙ Luca, V.C. ... Antibodies to Interleukin-2 Elicit Selective T Cell Subset Potentiation through Distinct Conformational Mechanisms Immunity. 2015; 42 :815-825 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (99) PubMed Google Scholar ). After 24 h, we observed a modest 34%, 36%, and 41% reduction in global Treg Foxp3, CTLA-4, and IL-2Rα expression, respectively, suggestive of partially reduced suppressive functionality ( Figure S1 J). However, the Tregs in micro-domains surrounding PD-1 + CD4 + T cells were disproportionately affected as local Treg Foxp3, CTLA4, and IL-2Rα expression fell by 60%, 67%, and 62%, respectively ( Figure 2 D). These observations demonstrated that IL-2 secreted from self-activated T cells enhanced local Treg function.
To sustain high level IL-2 production, activated CD4 + T cells require signaling through CD28, a costimulatory receptor that binds CD80 and CD86 on DCs. Tregs within micro-domains should limit these interactions due to enhanced expression of CTLA-4, which outcompetes CD28 for both costimulatory ligands ( Figures 2 A–2C; Collins et al., 2002 23. Collins, A.V. ∙ Brodie, D.W. ∙ Gilbert, R.J.C. ... The interaction properties of costimulatory molecules revisited Immunity. 2002; 17 :201-210 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (454) PubMed Google Scholar ; Qureshi et al., 2011 74. Qureshi, O.S. ∙ Zheng, Y. ∙ Nakamura, K. ... Trans-endocytosis of CD80 and CD86: a molecular basis for the cell-extrinsic function of CTLA-4 Science. 2011; 332 :600-603 Crossref Scopus (879) PubMed Google Scholar ). Tregs in micro-domains should also limit autocrine and paracrine IL-2 signaling in self-activated T cells due to enhanced expression of IL-2Rα, which greatly increases binding affinity for the cytokine ( Feinerman et al., 2010 30. Feinerman, O. ∙ Jentsch, G. ∙ Tkach, K.E. ... Single-cell quantification of IL-2 response by effector and regulatory T cells reveals critical plasticity in immune response Mol. Syst. Biol. 2010; 6 :437 Crossref Scopus (140) PubMed Google Scholar ). Disrupting micro-domain functionality should, therefore, increase IL-2 production and sensing in self-activated T cells. We tested this hypothesis using animals in which Tregs expressed the human diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) (Foxp3 DTR +/+ ) ( Kim et al., 2007 53. Kim, J.M. ∙ Rasmussen, J.P. ∙ Rudensky, A.Y. Regulatory T cells prevent catastrophic autoimmunity throughout the lifespan of mice Nat. Immunol. 2007; 8 :191-197 Crossref Scopus (1224) PubMed Google Scholar ). This system enabled acute Treg perturbation because diphtheria toxin (DTX) selectively inhibits protein synthesis in cells expressing the DTR ( Honjo et al., 1969 44. Honjo, T. ∙ Nishizuka, Y. ∙ Hayaishi, O. Adenosine diphosphoribosylation of aminoacyl transferase II by diphtheria toxin Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1969; 34 :603-608 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). 7 h after injecting DTX, Treg CTLA-4 and IL-2Rα expression declined by 47% and 32%, respectively, without grossly altering Treg cell number ( Figures S1 K and S1L). Concomitantly, we observed an ∼14-fold increase in pSTAT5 + CD4 + T cells, an effect prevented by IL-2 blocking Abs ( Figures 2 E–2G and S1 M). These emerging IL-2 “responders” were highly enriched in PD-1 expression ( Figure 2 H). Animals treated with DTX also displayed an ∼4-fold increase in pSTAT5 + Tregs, an effect once again prevented by IL-2 blocking Abs ( Figures 2 E–2G). This observation was consistent with enhanced IL-2 production, presumably saturating neighboring Tregs and thereby increasing the range of cytokine diffusion throughout the LN ( Oyler-Yaniv et al., 2017 70. Oyler-Yaniv, A. ∙ Oyler-Yaniv, J. ∙ Whitlock, B.M. ... A Tunable Diffusion-Consumption Mechanism of Cytokine Propagation Enables Plasticity in Cell-to-Cell Communication in the Immune System Immunity. 2017; 46 :609-620 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ). Overall, these data revealed a paracrine feedback process that rapidly constrained IL-2 production and sensing by self-activated T cells.
To determine the fate of self-activated T cells, we synchronized T cell activation and tracked responses over time using an adoptive transfer system. Healthy BALB/c mice were injected with Rag2 −/− TxA23 cells—transgenic CD4 + T cells that recognize an endogenous self-peptide derived from the gastric K + /H + ATPase. The peptide is presented constitutively by DCs within the gastric LN of BALB/c mice ( Scheinecker et al., 2002 80. Scheinecker, C. ∙ McHugh, R. ∙ Shevach, E.M. ... Constitutive presentation of a natural tissue autoantigen exclusively by dendritic cells in the draining lymph node J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196 :1079-1090 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Importantly, low numbers of transferred TxA23 cells only induce autoimmune gastritis in the absence of recipient Tregs ( McHugh et al., 2001 67. McHugh, R.S. ∙ Shevach, E.M. ∙ Margulies, D.H. ... A T cell receptor transgenic model of severe, spontaneous organ-specific autoimmunity Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31 :2094-2103 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Suri-Payer et al., 1998 94. Suri-Payer, E. ∙ Amar, A.Z. ∙ Thornton, A.M. ... CD4+CD25+ T cells inhibit both the induction and effector function of autoreactive T cells and represent a unique lineage of immunoregulatory cells J. Immunol. 1998; 160 :1212-1218 PubMed Google Scholar ).
Within the gastric LN, TxA23 cells, but not co-transferred wild-type (WT) cells, upregulated PD-1 over time, consistent with TCR-mediated activation despite functional Tregs. However, most TxA23 cells lacked pSTAT5 expression, analogous to polyclonal self-activated T cells in C57BL/6 mice ( Figures 1 , 2 , and S2 A–S2C). Next, we imaged the entire gastric LN at single-cell resolution using Clearing enhanced 3D (C e 3D) ( Li et al., 2017 57. Li, W. ∙ Germain, R.N. ∙ Gerner, M.Y. Multiplex, quantitative cellular analysis in large tissue volumes with clearing-enhanced 3D microscopy (C e 3D) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :E7321-E7330 Crossref Scopus (126) PubMed Google Scholar ). This method allowed us to study physiological numbers of TxA23 and WT cells in situ , limiting artifacts due to intraclonal competition ( Figures 3 A and 3B; Hataye et al., 2006 40. Hataye, J. ∙ Moon, J.J. ∙ Khoruts, A. ... Naive and memory CD4+ T cell survival controlled by clonal abundance Science. 2006; 312 :114-116 Crossref Scopus (277) PubMed Google Scholar ; Jenkins and Moon, 2012 48. Jenkins, M.K. ∙ Moon, J.J. The role of naive T cell precursor frequency and recruitment in dictating immune response magnitude J. Immunol. 2012; 188 :4135-4140 Crossref Scopus (184) PubMed Google Scholar ). We initially allowed a small number of TxA23 and WT cells to enter the gastric LN for 24 h and then blocked further entry and exit using anti-CD62L and FTY720, respectively, confining cells to a single location for accurate enumeration. 24 h post-transfer, ∼18 ± 4 TxA23 cells and ∼20 ± 3 WT cells were observed within the entire gastric LN ( Figure 3 A; Video S1 ). Surprisingly, by 72 h post-transfer, TxA23 cells selectively increased in number by 20-fold and many showed increased physical volume, a prerequisite to division. We also observed rare clusters of these cells scattered throughout the gastric LN, consistent with local proliferation ( Figures 3 A and 3B; Video S2 ). However, such expansion was relatively short-lived; TxA23 cell numbers fell significantly by 120 h post-transfer and returned to an average of ∼31 ± 7 by 192 h post-transfer ( Figure 3 A; Video S3 ). These data revealed that self-activated TxA23 cells underwent fleeting proliferation followed by rapid death, a process we refer to as “pruning.”

TxA23 cells are rapidly pruned from the host following proliferation, related to Figure 3 Ce3D imaging of the entire gastric LN 192h after co-transferring 5x10 4 TxA23 (orange) and WT cells (cyan) into healthy BALB/c recipients. See Figure 3A for experimental details. Endogenous Foxp3 (purple) depicts Tregs.
To ensure that confining TxA23 cells to the gastric LN did not artifactually promote proliferation, we repeated the experiment in the absence of anti-CD62L and FTY-720. Transferred cells were pre-labeled with fluorescent dyes, providing a means to quantify cell division in situ ( Figures S3 A–S3C). 48 h post-transfer, two TxA23 cell populations were observed in the gastric LN: 60% were undivided, whereas 40% were a product of one division ( Figure S3 B). At 96 h post-transfer, TxA23 cell proliferation increased further; 18% of cells were undivided whereas the remainder were the product of 1 (19%), 2 (34%), or 3 (29%) rounds of cell division ( Figures 3 C and S3 C). In comparison, 100% of WT cells were undivided at both time points ( Figures S3 D and S3E). Proliferation was not a unique property of TxA23 cells as polyclonal CD4 + T cells enriched in PD-1 exhibited high expression of Ki67, a cell-cycle associated protein ( Figures 3 D and 3E).
Because C57BL/6 animals generally fail to develop autoimmunity, many PD-1 + CD4 + T cells should be eliminated by pruning, analogous to TxA23 cells. We assessed this possibility in situ by immunostaining for active caspase 3, the effector protease underlying apoptosis ( Nicholson et al., 1995 69. Nicholson, D.W. ∙ Ali, A. ∙ Thornberry, N.A. ... Identification and inhibition of the ICE/CED-3 protease necessary for mammalian apoptosis Nature. 1995; 376 :37-43 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Compared to PD-1 − CD4 + T cells, PD-1 + CD4 + T cells were highly enriched in active caspase 3, consistent with ongoing pruning ( Figures 3 F–3H).
Given IL-2’s role in enhancing T cell proliferation and survival, Treg micro-domains likely promote pruning by restricting IL-2 sensing in self-activated T cells ( Akbar et al., 1993 1. Akbar, A.N. ∙ Borthwick, N. ∙ Salmon, M. ... The significance of low bcl-2 expression by CD45RO T cells in normal individuals and patients with acute viral infections. The role of apoptosis in T cell memory J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178 :427-438 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar , 1996 2. Akbar, A.N. ∙ Borthwick, N.J. ∙ Wickremasinghe, R.G. ... Interleukin-2 receptor common gamma-chain signaling cytokines regulate activated T cell apoptosis in response to growth factor withdrawal: selective induction of anti-apoptotic (bcl-2, bcl-xL) but not pro-apoptotic (bax, bcl-xS) gene expression Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26 :294-299 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, we administered the IL-2:S4B6-1 immunocomplex—that engages IL2-Rβ and IL-2Rγ but not IL-2Rα—to force IL-2 signaling in self-activated T cells, despite Tregs ( Boyman et al., 2006 16. Boyman, O. ∙ Kovar, M. ∙ Rubinstein, M.P. ... Selective stimulation of T cell subsets with antibody-cytokine immune complexes Science. 2006; 311 :1924-1927 Crossref Scopus (613) PubMed Google Scholar ; Spangler et al., 2015 92.

Antibodies to Interleukin-2 Elicit Selective T Cell Subset Potentiation through Distinct Conformational Mechanisms Immunity. 2015; 42 :815-825 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (99) PubMed Google Scholar ). This complex reduced activated caspase 3 expression by ∼50% in PD-1 + CD4 + T cells but not PD-1 − CD4 + T cells ( Figures 3 G and 3H). IL-2-S4B61 also enhanced the absolute number of TxA23 cells in the gastric LN by ∼4-fold at 72 h post-transfer, consistent with increased proliferation and survival, while selectively increasing the number and size of TxA23 cell clusters ( Figures S3 F–S3J). These results supported a model in which Treg micro-domains rapidly constrained IL-2 sensing in self-activated T cells, ultimately shaping their division number and “time to death” ( Heinzel et al., 2017 41. Heinzel, S. ∙ Binh Giang, T. ∙ Kan, A. ... A Myc-dependent division timer complements a cell-death timer to regulate T cell and B cell responses Nat. Immunol. 2017; 18 :96-103 Crossref Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar ; Marchingo et al., 2014 64. Marchingo, J.M. ∙ Kan, A. ∙ Sutherland, R.M. ... T cell signaling. Antigen affinity, costimulation, and cytokine inputs sum linearly to amplify T cell expansion Science. 2014; 346 :1123-1127 Crossref Scopus (120) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We explored whether IL-2 contributed to micro-domain formation itself by monitoring TxA23 cell activation along with local Treg signaling state and density over time. 12.5 h post-transfer, we observed enrichment of pSTAT5 + Tregs (λ pSTAT5 + Treg ) surrounding TxA23 but not WT cells ( Figure 4 A), implying that activated TxA23 cells secreted IL-2 sensed by proximal Tregs. However, this early wave of IL-2 consumption preceded the formation of true micro-domains since the local Treg density (λ Treg ), irrespective of pSTAT5 status, remained low ( Figure 4 A).
By 24 h post-transfer, λ pSTAT5 + Treg began to decay, suggesting that TxA23 cells now produced less IL-2 due to Treg-mediated feedback. In accord, λ Treg increased simultaneously and selectively near TxA23 cells ( Figures 4 A and 4B). By 48 h post-transfer, λ pSTAT5 + Treg for TxA23 cells returned to near baseline levels, indicating that the response had largely subsided, whereas λ Treg remained partially elevated compared to WT cells ( Figure 4 A).
Next, we repeated the experiment but co-injected IL-2 blocking antibodies ( Spangler et al., 2015 92. Spangler, J.B. ∙ Tomala, J. ∙ Luca, V.C. ... Antibodies to Interleukin-2 Elicit Selective T Cell Subset Potentiation through Distinct Conformational Mechanisms Immunity. 2015; 42 :815-825 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (99) PubMed Google Scholar ). After 24 h, the blocking antibodies eliminated the pSTAT5 signal within Tregs without significantly altering their global density ( Figures S4 A and S4B). However, we observed a preferential reduction in the local Treg density surrounding TxA23 cells ( Figures 4 C and 4D). These findings also held true in C57BL/6 mice: IL-2 blocking antibodies preferentially reduced the local Treg density surrounding PD-1 + CD4 + T cells ( Figure 4 E).
Many Tregs in micro-domains expressed Ki67 and exhibited increased volume, suggesting that paracrine IL-2 signaling facilitated local Treg proliferation, giving rise to micro-domains ( Figures 2 A–2C; Setoguchi et al., 2005 84. Setoguchi, R. ∙ Hori, S. ∙ Takahashi, T. ... Homeostatic maintenance of natural Foxp3(+) CD25(+) CD4(+) regulatory T cells by interleukin (IL)-2 and induction of autoimmune disease by IL-2 neutralization J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201 :723-735 Crossref Scopus (915) PubMed Google Scholar ). To better visualize this pattern, we computed local Treg densities weighted to local Treg Ki67 expression levels, revealing highly proliferative micro-domains within the paracortex ( Figure 5 A). Correlating Treg Ki67 expression with intercellular distance further revealed that Tregs most enriched in Ki67 were highly clustered. These results could not be explained by chance as the observed probability distribution did not fit a random permutation null model ( Figure 5 B).
If nascent micro-domains are a product of local proliferation, then the constituent Tregs should display clonality. We therefore generated Foxp3CreERT2 +/− -Confetti fl/− animals in which Tregs stochastically express distinct fluorescent proteins (FPs) upon administrating tamoxifen ( Figure S4 C; Livet et al., 2007 61. Livet, J. ∙ Weissman, T.A. ∙ Kang, H. ... Transgenic strategies for combinatorial expression of fluorescent proteins in the nervous system Nature. 2007; 450 :56-62 Crossref Scopus (1226) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rubtsov et al., 2010 78. Rubtsov, Y.P. ∙ Niec, R.E. ∙ Josefowicz, S. ... Stability of the regulatory T cell lineage in vivo Science. 2010; 329 :1667-1671 Crossref Scopus (481) PubMed Google Scholar ). Micro-domain clonality was subsequently assessed based on Treg clusters expressing the same fluorescent protein (FP). Low gene recombination frequencies made it unlikely for single-FP clusters to arise by chance ( Figure 5 C).
We observed co-localized Treg clusters expressing either CFP, YFP, or RFP near CD4 + PD-1 + T cells in the LN paracortex, consistent with local expansion ( Figures 5 D, 5E, and S4 D). Such clusters could not be explained by chance as the observed density of single FP-expressing Tregs failed to fit a random permutation null model ( Figure 5 E). These results revealed that IL-2 secreted by self-activated T cells enhanced local Treg proliferation, forming micro-domains of activated Tregs that reciprocally constrained self-activated T cells.
Our data revealed a feedback control system that constrained weakly activated T cells, halting incipient autoimmune responses. To assess the feedback machinery’s robustness—the property of functional invariance toward internal parameter variation—we built a multiscale computational model that incorporated our experimental observations and data from the literature ( Figure 6 A; Tables S1 and S2 ). Importantly, we simulated internal parameter variation by sampling combinations of parameter values from their homeostatic ranges ( Table S1 ).
We simulated CD4 + T cell activation by an antigen-bearing DC, along with Treg imposed signaling constraints that evolved over time ( Figures 2 D, 4 A, and 6 A). We then measured the maximum pSTAT5 signal within the CD4 + T cell (pSTAT5 CD4-max ) at any time point following activation (up to 120 h) as a readout of escape from Treg control. To assess the impact of individual parameters on the pSTAT5 CD4-max , we applied a new computational framework, termed machine learning of parameter-phenotype analysis (MAPPA) ( Park et al., 2019 73. Park, K. ∙ Prüstel, T. ∙ Lu, Y. ... Machine learning of stochastic gene network phenotypes bioRxiv. 2019; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). MAPPA analyzed 20,000 dynamic simulations, each initialized with a combination of biologically plausible parameter values (“configurations”). The majority of parameter configurations generated a low pSTAT5 CD4-max , consistent with the nearly negligible frequency of pSTAT5 + CD4 + T cells in LNs of healthy animals ( Figures 2 F, 2G, 6 B, and 6C). However, the few configurations that did produce a large pSTAT5 CD4-max —referred to as “active” configurations—showed characteristic features, such as elevated co-stimulatory molecules on DCs ([CD80/86]) and low local Treg densities (Treg λ ) ( Figure 6 D; Table S1 ).
MAPPA subsequently built a random forest (RF) machine-learning (ML) regression model that mapped parameter configurations to pSTAT5 CD4-max with high predictive accuracy (r = 0.95) ( Figures S5 A and S5B). This statistical model determined which parameters were most critical in predicting pSTAT5 CD4-max and ranked Treg λ second highest in terms of “variable importance” ( Figures 6 E and S5 C). Accordingly, new dynamical simulations showed that increasing or decreasing Treg λ by 2-fold significantly impacted the number of active configurations ( Figures 6 E and 6F).
We proceeded to examine dynamic trajectories of IL-2 secretion, IL-2Rα expression, and pSTAT5 signaling in CD4 + T cells as Treg λ was lowered linearly down to 50% ( Figures S5 D–S5F). Decreasing the local Treg density increased IL-2 secretion duration and amplitude linearly ( Figure S5 D). By comparison, IL-2Rα expression and pSTAT5 signaling exhibited non-linearities: both parameter values increased sharply after a 40% reduction in the local Treg density ( Figures S5 E and S5F). Thus, modest reductions in micro-domain size shifted specific configurations from inactive to active.
The model implied that high Treg densities compensated for reduced Treg functionality in microdomains, preventing self-activated CD4 + T cells from responding to IL-2 ( Figures 6 D–6F). To explore the limits of this compensation, we simulated disrupting local Treg functions by setting critical parameters outside of their homeostatic range, including Treg’s ability to strip co-stimulatory ligands or sense IL-2. Such perturbations can arise naturally due to genetic variation. For instance, two heterozygous variants have been identified in humans that reduce cell-surface CTLA-4 or IL-2Rβ expression by ∼50%. Many patients expressing the CTLA-4 variant develop multi-organ autoimmune disease, primarily attributed to defective Treg function, whereas those expressing the IL-2Rβ variant appear stable ( Kuehn et al., 2014 55. Kuehn, H.S. ∙ Ouyang, W. ∙ Lo, B. ... Immune dysregulation in human subjects with heterozygous germline mutations in CTLA4 Science. 2014; 345 :1623-1627 Crossref Scopus (508) PubMed Google Scholar ; Schubert et al., 2014 82. Schubert, D. ∙ Bode, C. ∙ Kenefeck, R. ... Autosomal dominant immune dysregulation syndrome in humans with CTLA4 mutations Nat. Med. 2014; 20 :1410-1416 Crossref Scopus (484) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhang et al., 2019 112. Zhang, Z. ∙ Gothe, F. ∙ Pennamen, P. ... Human interleukin-2 receptor β mutations associated with defects in immunity and peripheral tolerance J. Exp. Med. 2019; 216 :1311-1327 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ). To test the impact of these perturbations on self-activated T cell control, we ran 20,000 new simulations, selectively reducing each protein by 50% in Tregs. As shown in Figure 6 G, reducing CTLA-4 or IL-2Rβ by 50% resulted in 783 (3.9%) or 85 (0.4%) new configurations with a large pSTAT5 CD4-max , respectively. We refer to these configurations as “susceptible” because they only become active upon perturbing local Treg functionality ( Figures 6 G and 6H).
To determine why the Treg CTLA-4 variant revealed significantly more susceptible configurations than the IL-2Rβ variant, we again examined dynamic trajectories. A 50% reduction in Treg CTLA-4, but not IL-2Rβ, modestly increased IL-2 secretion duration and amplitude due to increased co-stimulation, leading to a non-linear amplification of IL-2Rα and pSTAT5 expression in the CD4 + T cell ( Figures S5 G–S5I). Thus, our model predicts that time-integrated (“total”) IL-2 secretion is critical in determining whether an activated T cell exceeds local micro-domain constraints, even when Treg density is high. These in silico data begin to explain why patients harboring heterozygous variants in CTLA-4 but not IL-2Rβ often develop autoimmunity.
Within the parameter space, susceptible configurations resided near those that were active, suggesting that the former were on the verge, but fell just short of breaking down during homeostasis ( Figure 6 H). MAPPA revealed that Treg λ was by far the most important parameter separating these two groups, with susceptible configurations generally exhibiting ∼2-fold higher Treg λ than active configurations ( Figures 6 I and S5 J–S5L). Thus, elevated Treg densities in susceptible configurations were often sufficient to constrain self-activated T cells as long as the other parameter values fell within homeostatic ranges. However, modest secondary hits that affected local Treg functionality (e.g., reduction in CTLA-4 expression) made these regions active, enabling self-activated T cells to escape control.
To understand why susceptible configurations were on the verge of breaking down, we computed a correlation matrix, which revealed critical dependencies between parameters ( Figure 6 J). For instance, we observed a positive correlation between Treg λ and [CD80/86], indicating that high local Treg densities could be overridden by high levels of co-stimulatory ligands on DCs. A similar relationship emerged between Treg λ and the amount of antigen displayed on DCs ([antigen]). Conversely, we observed a negative correlation between Treg λ and TCR off-rate , indicating that high local Treg densities were also offset by activated CD4 + T cells with low pMHC-TCR off-rates ( Figure 6 J). These data illustrated how variation in baseline conditions altered the risk of self-activated T cells escaping control following modest changes to Treg functionality.
To test our modeling predictions in vivo , we manipulated specific parameters underlying the feedback machinery ( Figure 7 A). To control micro-domain size, we employed Foxp3CreERT +/+ -TCR-α fl/fl mice to selectively delete the TCR alpha chain in Tregs using tamoxifen ( Levine et al., 2014 56. Levine, A.G. ∙ Arvey, A. ∙ Jin, W. ... Continuous requirement for the TCR in regulatory T cell function Nat. Immunol. 2014; 15 :1070-1078 Crossref Scopus (303) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure S6 A). Loss of the Treg TCR caused micro-domains to dissipate without significantly affecting Treg numbers, while increasing paracortical pSTAT5 + CD4 + T cell frequency by ∼4-fold ( Figures 7 B, S6 B, and S6C). These IL-2 responders exhibited low densities of surrounding Tregs and expressed high levels of PD-1 and IL-2Rα ( Figures 7 C, S6 C, and S6H). In parallel, paracortical pSTAT5 + Tregs increased by ∼2-fold, suggestive of enhanced IL-2 production by self-activated T cells ( Figure 7 B). These observations demonstrated that Treg-mediated feedback failed in the absence of micro-domains, consistent with previous findings ( Liu et al., 2015 60. Liu, Z. ∙ Gerner, M.Y. ∙ Van Panhuys, N. ... Immune homeostasis enforced by co-localized effector and regulatory T cells Nature. 2015; 528 :225-230 Crossref Scopus (169) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The computational model predicted that the impact of micro-domain size on self-activated T cells was non-linear: reductions of less than 40% had only minor effects while those at or above 40% significantly increased IL-2 sensing ( Figures S5 D–S5F). To test these predictions, we sub-lethally irradiated WT animals, reconstituting their hematopoietic system with different ratios of bone marrow from WT and Foxp3DTR +/+ mice ( Figures S6 D and S6E). After 10 weeks, we selectively ablated the Foxp3DTR +/+ Tregs by administering DTX for 2 days ( Figure S6 F). A 15% reduction in Treg density had little effect on the system, whereas a 40% reduction substantially increased the frequency of pSTAT5 + CD4 + T cells (∼3-fold). These IL-2 responders were highly enriched in PD-1, consistent with activation by self-pMHC ( Figures 7 B–7D). The model also predicted that reducing micro-domain size would increase IL-2 production by self-activated T cells ( Figure S5 D). Accordingly, we observed an ∼2-fold increase in paracortical pSTAT5 + Tregs following a 40% reduction in Treg density ( Figure 7 B).
To simulate secondary hits that might convert potential susceptible configurations to active configurations, we manipulated micro-domain functionality by generating Foxp3CreERT +/+ -CTLA-4 +/fl and Foxp3CreERT +/− -IL2Rβ +/fl animals. In these mice, a single CTLA-4 or IL-2Rβ allele is disrupted in Tregs following tamoxifen administration ( Figure S6 G). pSTAT5 + CD4 + T cells increased by ∼4- and ∼2-fold upon disrupting Treg CTLA-4 or IL-2Rβ, respectively, supporting our predictions in silico ( Figures 6 G, 7 B, and S5 G–S5I). As expected, IL-2 responders exhibited high expression of PD-1 and IL-2Rα ( Figures 7 C and S6 H). Our simulations further predicted that perturbing Treg CTLA-4, but not IL-2Rβ, would enhance IL-2 production by self-activated T cells ( Figures S5 G–S5I). Consistent with this possibility, we observed an ∼2.5-fold increase in paracortical pSTAT5 + Tregs after deleting one copy of CTLA-4. By contrast, deleting one copy of Treg IL-2Rβ decreased the frequency of paracortical pSTAT5 + Tregs by ∼2-fold, with a less severe effect on self-activated T cell control ( Figure 7 B).
Enhanced Treg IL-2 sensing coincided with elevated paracortical Treg frequencies in Foxp3CreERT +/+ -CTLA-4 +/fl animals treated with tamoxifen, likely due to enhanced proliferation ( Figure S7 A). This effect was not observed upon perturbing one copy of IL-2Rβ. However, many micro-domains still failed to prevent self-activated T cell escape in the CTLA-4 +/− condition ( Figures 7 B and 7E). Thus, increasing local Treg density alone did not sufficiently compensate for reduced Treg functionality, specifically in terms of CTLA-4 ( Figure S7 B). This finding is in keeping with the fact that patients harboring heterozygous CTLA-4 variants also exhibit elevated Treg frequencies but often develop autoimmunity ( Kuehn et al., 2014 55. Kuehn, H.S. ∙ Ouyang, W. ∙ Lo, B. ... Immune dysregulation in human subjects with heterozygous germline mutations in CTLA4 Science. 2014; 345 :1623-1627 Crossref Scopus (508) PubMed Google Scholar ; Schubert et al., 2014 82. Schubert, D. ∙ Bode, C. ∙ Kenefeck, R. ... Autosomal dominant immune dysregulation syndrome in humans with CTLA4 mutations Nat. Med. 2014; 20 :1410-1416 Crossref Scopus (484) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Increased IL-2 sensing in self-activated T cells should impair their pruning. To examine this hypothesis, we chose two of the five inducible systems and assessed active caspase 3 expression. In either the 60% WT + 40% Foxp3DTR +/+ chimeras treated with DTX or Foxp3CreERT +/− -IL-2Rβ +/fl animals treated with tamoxifen, we observed a ∼50% reduction in the frequency of apoptotic PD-1 + CD4 + T cells, but not PD-1 − CD4 + T cells compared to vehicle controls ( Figure 7 F). These results demonstrated that modest perturbations to the feedback machinery enabled some self-activated T cells to escape control.
The Treg feedback system must constrain autoimmune T cell responses while permitting host-protective responses during times of infection. To explore how such discrimination occurs, we again turned to our modeling studies. MAPPA predicted that T cells in active and susceptible configurations generally exhibited reduced TCR off-rates than those in inactive configurations ( Figure S7 C). Thus, T cells stimulated by ligands with high affinities for the TCR—characteristic of foreign pathogens—might overcome Treg-mediated feedback ( Vrisekoop et al., 2014 106. Vrisekoop, N. ∙ Monteiro, J.P. ∙ Mandl, J.N. ... Revisiting thymic positive selection and the mature T cell repertoire for antigen Immunity. 2014; 41 :181-190 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). We examined this prediction by injecting healthy B10.A mice with transgenic Rag2 −/− 5C.C7 cells. 5C.C7 T cells recognize an exogenous peptide derived from the foreign moth cytochrome c protein (MCC 88–103 ) and presented by the MHC class II molecule, I-E k ( Fink et al., 1986 33. Fink, P.J. ∙ Matis, L.A. ∙ McElligott, D.L. ... Correlations between T-cell specificity and the structure of the antigen receptor Nature. 1986; 321 :219-226 Crossref Scopus (312) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We first employed a variant of the naturally occurring peptide that contains a threonine to serine substitution at position 102 (T102S) ( Figure 7 G). This peptide in complex with I-E k exhibits a high off-rate for the 5C.C7 TCR, serving as a partial agonist that simulates a weak but stimulatory self-pMHC ( Corse et al., 2010 24. Corse, E. ∙ Gottschalk, R.A. ∙ Krogsgaard, M. ... Attenuated T cell responses to a high-potency ligand in vivo PLoS Biol. 2010; 8 :e1000481 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ; Reay et al., 1994 76. Reay, P.A. ∙ Kantor, R.M. ∙ Davis, M.M. Use of global amino acid replacements to define the requirements for MHC binding and T cell recognition of moth cytochrome c (93-103) J. Immunol. 1994; 152 :3946-3957 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Following subcutaneous injection of T102S, many transferred 5C.C7 cells displayed signs of TCR-mediated activation in the draining popliteal LN ( Figure S7 D). However, despite being stimulated by a foreign antigen, the behavior of these cells mimicked self-activated T cells, with an early wave of IL-2 sensing in proximal Tregs, followed by an increase in local Treg density ( Figure S7 E). Most importantly, the majority of 5C.C7 cells stimulated by T102S failed to phosphorylate STAT5 at any measured time points ( Figures 7 G, 7H, and S7 F). These findings implied that Tregs were equally capable of constraining T cell responses toward self-antigens and weak foreign antigens ( Pace et al., 2012 71.

We then repeated the experiment with an agonistic peptide, MCC (88–103), which, in complex with I-E k , exhibits a low off-rate for the 5C.C7 TCR ( Figure 7 G). 48 h post-injection, we observed an ∼5-fold increase in transferred 5C.C7 cells expressing pSTAT5, consistent with their ability to respond to IL-2 even in the presence of Tregs ( Figure 7 H). Both λ pSTAT5+Treg and λ Treg were also lower near cells stimulated with MCC (88–103) than T102S at later points in time, suggesting that some 5C.C7 cells outcompeted Tregs for IL-2 when engaging the agonist, limiting micro-domain growth ( Figure S7 E). This increase in 5C.C7 cell IL-2 sensing correlated with enhanced proliferation ( Figures S7 G and S7H). These results demonstrated that increasing TCR ligand strength alone enabled a fraction of activated T cells to escape Treg control.

Section: Discussion

Here we applied new imaging and computational approaches to study the interactions between self-activated T cells and Tregs at physiological numbers in situ . Our data reveal a paracrine feedback process initiated following CD4 + T cell activation. T cells activated by self-antigens or weak foreign antigens produce IL-2 and transiently expand, only for the progeny to die rapidly. Small changes (<2-fold) in the local Treg density or expression of critical molecules, such as CTLA-4, enable self-activated T cells to exceed feedback control and subvert pruning. These findings provide an integrated view of how immune homeostasis is maintained and emphasize how subtle shifts in immune cell parameter values can initiate autoimmune states ( Simeonov et al., 2020 89. Simeonov, D.R. ∙ Wong, H.S. ∙ Cortez, J.T. ... T cell subset-selective IL2RA enhancers shape autoimmune diabetes risk bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ).
Our approaches revealed ongoing pruning of self-activated T cells, building upon pioneering work from Pandiyan et al. (2007) 72. Pandiyan, P. ∙ Zheng, L. ∙ Ishihara, S. ... CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells induce cytokine deprivation-mediated apoptosis of effector CD4+ T cells Nat. Immunol. 2007; 8 :1353-1362 Crossref Scopus (802) PubMed Google Scholar . This process depends on at least two distinct Treg mechanisms operating within microdomains to rapidly limit IL-2 production and sensing by self-activated T cells ( Pandiyan et al., 2007 72. Pandiyan, P. ∙ Zheng, L. ∙ Ishihara, S. ... CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells induce cytokine deprivation-mediated apoptosis of effector CD4+ T cells Nat. Immunol. 2007; 8 :1353-1362 Crossref Scopus (802) PubMed Google Scholar ; Qureshi et al., 2011 74. Qureshi, O.S. ∙ Zheng, Y. ∙ Nakamura, K. ... Trans-endocytosis of CD80 and CD86: a molecular basis for the cell-extrinsic function of CTLA-4 Science. 2011; 332 :600-603 Crossref Scopus (879) PubMed Google Scholar ). Additional forms of control are also likely to function within these regions ( Buszko and Shevach, 2020 19. Buszko, M. ∙ Shevach, E.M. Control of regulatory T cell homeostasis Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2020; 67 :18-26 Crossref Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although seemingly diverse, many Treg activities can constrain IL-2 production or sensing, a focus likely due to this cytokine’s multifactorial role in scaling immune responses ( Liao et al., 2011 58. Liao, W. ∙ Lin, J.-X. ∙ Leonard, W.J. IL-2 family cytokines: new insights into the complex roles of IL-2 as a broad regulator of T helper cell differentiation Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2011; 23 :598-604 Crossref Scopus (398) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, because IL-2 is a soluble mediator, it can permeate throughout SLOs, potentially promoting cooperativity between distant T cells ( Butler et al., 2013 20. Butler, T.C. ∙ Kardar, M. ∙ Chakraborty, A.K. Quorum sensing allows T cells to discriminate between self and nonself Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110 :11833-11838 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, Treg micro-domains must control the length scale over which this cytokine diffuses, limiting paracrine communication between multiple self-activated T cells ( Oyler-Yaniv et al., 2017 70. Oyler-Yaniv, A. ∙ Oyler-Yaniv, J. ∙ Whitlock, B.M. ... A Tunable Diffusion-Consumption Mechanism of Cytokine Propagation Enables Plasticity in Cell-to-Cell Communication in the Immune System Immunity. 2017; 46 :609-620 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The present findings further emphasize that Tregs fail to prevent a fraction of T cells from being activated by self-antigens ( Liu et al., 2015 60. Liu, Z. ∙ Gerner, M.Y. ∙ Van Panhuys, N. ... Immune homeostasis enforced by co-localized effector and regulatory T cells Nature. 2015; 528 :225-230 Crossref Scopus (169) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although pro-active mechanisms, such as continuous stripping of pMHC complexes, may reduce the overall number of self-activation events, they are insufficient to maintain immune homeostasis ( Akkaya et al., 2019 3. Akkaya, B. ∙ Oya, Y. ∙ Akkaya, M. ... Regulatory T cells mediate specific suppression by depleting peptide-MHC class II from dendritic cells Nat. Immunol. 2019; 20 :218-231 Crossref Scopus (75) PubMed Google Scholar ; Qureshi et al., 2011 74. Qureshi, O.S. ∙ Zheng, Y. ∙ Nakamura, K. ... Trans-endocytosis of CD80 and CD86: a molecular basis for the cell-extrinsic function of CTLA-4 Science. 2011; 332 :600-603 Crossref Scopus (879) PubMed Google Scholar ). Instead, feedback control is essential for constraining the ∼2%–4% of CD4 + T cells that are continually activated in SLOs of healthy hosts.
Tregs exert this feedback control in a time-delayed manner. This design reoccurs throughout biology, conferring systems with unique dynamical properties. In response to an input stimulus, time-delayed negative feedback can lead to a pulsed output followed by adaptation, a process in which a system returns to its initial conditions ( Ferrell, 2016 32. Ferrell, Jr., J.E. Perfect and Near-Perfect Adaptation in Cell Signaling Cell Syst. 2016; 2 :62-67 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). In biochemical networks, delays of this type most often occur due to the time necessary for de novo synthesis of the feedback molecules themselves ( Alon, 2007 6. Alon, U. Network motifs: theory and experimental approaches Nat. Rev. Genet. 2007; 8 :450-461 Crossref Scopus (1988) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the case of Tregs, the rates at which they proliferate and differentiate within micro-domains could serve as the delay, accounting for transient self-activated T cell proliferation (pulsed output), followed by rapid pruning (adaptation). A time delay would also permit host-protective immune responses during infection because T cells activated by high-affinity foreign antigens would have a critical time window during which they could override the slow rise in negative feedback. We suggest this override occurs in part due to the scaling of IL-2Rα expression and IL-2 production with increasing TCR ligand strength, allowing activated T cells to outcompete and saturate Tregs ( Allison et al., 2016 4. Allison, K.A. ∙ Sajti, E. ∙ Collier, J.G. ... Affinity and dose of TCR engagement yield proportional enhancer and gene activity in CD4+ T cells eLife. 2016; 5 :e10134 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ). The net result would be a pulsed output of higher amplitude or longer duration prior to adaptation.
The ability of individual micro-domains to constrain a self-activated T cell is tied to the density and functional state of constituent Tregs. These two parameters are fine-tuned by the degree of local IL-2 consumption, along with TCR and likely co-stimulatory receptor-mediated signaling. Different combinations of these three input signals should produce local Treg variation, likely accounting for micro-domain heterogeneity. This view explains previous observations whereby ablating the TCR, CD28 co-stimulatory receptor, or IL-2 receptor complex in Tregs alters their phenotype and promotes autoimmune disease ( Chinen et al., 2016 22. Chinen, T. ∙ Kannan, A.K. ∙ Levine, A.G. ... An essential role for the IL-2 receptor in T reg cell function Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17 :1322-1333 Crossref Scopus (306) PubMed Google Scholar ; Levine et al., 2014 56. Levine, A.G. ∙ Arvey, A. ∙ Jin, W. ... Continuous requirement for the TCR in regulatory T cell function Nat. Immunol. 2014; 15 :1070-1078 Crossref Scopus (303) PubMed Google Scholar ; Vahl et al., 2014 103. Vahl, J.C. ∙ Drees, C. ∙ Heger, K. ... Continuous T cell receptor signals maintain a functional regulatory T cell pool Immunity. 2014; 41 :722-736 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhang et al., 2013 111. Zhang, R. ∙ Huynh, A. ∙ Whitcher, G. ... An obligate cell-intrinsic function for CD28 in Tregs J. Clin. Invest. 2013; 123 :580-593 PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, no single input signal is sufficient for Tregs to maintain immune homeostasis. This concept also parallels the behavior of conventional T cells for which summation of the same signals dictates proliferation, differentiation, and survival ( Heinzel et al., 2017 41. Heinzel, S. ∙ Binh Giang, T. ∙ Kan, A. ... A Myc-dependent division timer complements a cell-death timer to regulate T cell and B cell responses Nat. Immunol. 2017; 18 :96-103 Crossref Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar ; Marchingo et al., 2014 64. Marchingo, J.M. ∙ Kan, A. ∙ Sutherland, R.M. ... T cell signaling. Antigen affinity, costimulation, and cytokine inputs sum linearly to amplify T cell expansion Science. 2014; 346 :1123-1127 Crossref Scopus (120) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tubo et al., 2013 102. Tubo, N.J. ∙ Pagán, A.J. ∙ Taylor, J.J. ... Single naive CD4+ T cells from a diverse repertoire produce different effector cell types during infection Cell. 2013; 153 :785-796 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (272) PubMed Google Scholar ). These observations imply that competing signal integration processes operate between Tregs and self-activated T cells, resulting in a localized, multi-input “tug of war” ( Höfer et al., 2012 43. Höfer, T. ∙ Krichevsky, O. ∙ Altan-Bonnet, G. Competition for IL-2 between Regulatory and Effector T Cells to Chisel Immune Responses Front. Immunol. 2012; 3 :268 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The Treg feedback machinery displayed robustness within a narrow range of parameter values. These findings are in line with the fact that specific monoallelic mutations, such as those affecting CTLA-4, can promote autoimmune disorders in humans ( Kuehn et al., 2014 55. Kuehn, H.S. ∙ Ouyang, W. ∙ Lo, B. ... Immune dysregulation in human subjects with heterozygous germline mutations in CTLA4 Science. 2014; 345 :1623-1627 Crossref Scopus (508) PubMed Google Scholar ; Schubert et al., 2014 82. Schubert, D. ∙ Bode, C. ∙ Kenefeck, R. ... Autosomal dominant immune dysregulation syndrome in humans with CTLA4 mutations Nat. Med. 2014; 20 :1410-1416 Crossref Scopus (484) PubMed Google Scholar ). This behavior is characteristic of systems governed by a sharp decision boundary. On either side, a system will converge to qualitatively distinct states (e.g., homeostasis or autoimmunity), in part due to non-linear amplification steps that reinforce stable “fixed points” ( Altan-Bonnet and Germain, 2005 7. Altan-Bonnet, G. ∙ Germain, R.N. Modeling T cell antigen discrimination based on feedback control of digital ERK responses PLoS Biol. 2005; 3 :e356 Crossref Scopus (334) PubMed Google Scholar ; Busse et al., 2010 18. Busse, D. ∙ de la Rosa, M. ∙ Hobiger, K. ... Competing feedback loops shape IL-2 signaling between helper and regulatory T lymphocytes in cellular microenvironments Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107 :3058-3063 Crossref Scopus (157) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our findings indicate that the local density and immunosuppressive capacity of Tregs in a micro-domain sets the decision boundary for individual T cell responses. Although the particular non-linear components remain to be determined, such considerations suggest that breakdowns in immune homeostasis need not arise solely from a single, severe insult, such as a loss or gain of function mutation. Rather, a combination of subtle immune imbalances may erroneously tip rare self-activated T cells across a decision boundary, leading to small, but iterative bursts of tissue damage that culminate in disease over time ( Marson et al., 2015 65. Marson, A. ∙ Housley, W.J. ∙ Hafler, D.A. Genetic basis of autoimmunity J. Clin. Invest. 2015; 125 :2234-2241 Crossref Scopus (68) PubMed Google Scholar ). These imbalances could stem from disease-associated genetic variants that only modestly impact the expression kinetics or quantity of proteins implicated in Treg, DC, or mature T cell function. Modern computational algorithms have identified several candidate variants of this class predominantly within non-coding regions of the genome (e.g., expression quantitative trait loci) ( Farh et al., 2015 29.

Genetic and epigenetic fine mapping of causal autoimmune disease variants Nature. 2015; 518 :337-343 Crossref Scopus (962) PubMed Google Scholar ; Simeonov et al., 2017 88.

Discovery of stimulation-responsive immune enhancers with CRISPR activation Nature. 2017; 549 :111-115 Crossref Scopus (117) PubMed Google Scholar ). Additionally, inflammatory signals or clinical immunotherapies may transiently shift the system outside of its robust parameter range, enabling some self-activated T cells to escape Treg feedback control ( June et al., 2017 50. June, C.H. ∙ Warshauer, J.T. ∙ Bluestone, J.A. Is autoimmunity the Achilles’ heel of cancer immunotherapy? Nat.

The integrative framework established in this study revealed new insights into the maintenance of immunological homeostasis. By studying the interplay between Tregs and activated T cells within intact tissue environments, we uncovered a paracrine feedback process that restrained early autoimmune and weak foreign responses. The quantitative features of this control system are highly relevant for understanding the emergence of autoimmune disorders, facilitating successful tumor immunotherapy, and enabling therapeutic manipulation of Tregs.
The specificity of polyclonal self-activated T cells identified in this study remains unknown. Future work is required to identify the precise TCR-pMHC combinations that promote T cell activation during homeostasis. In addition, although we refer to polyclonal CD4 + PD-1 + T cells as “self-activated,” some of these cells may in fact be stimulated by peptides derived from endogenous retroviruses co-existing with the host (i.e., stably integrated into the mouse genome). We suspect that T cell responses against such peptides are constrained by Treg feedback control, analogous to responses against bona fide self-peptides. This concept warrants future investigation. Finally, our study explored conditions during which self-activated T cells escape Treg feedback control and pruning in SLOs. However, we did not track the behavior and fate of these escapees within peripheral tissues. Future work is required to determine how much tissue damage each escapee can impart. It will also be essential to determine the rate at which escapees must enter peripheral tissues to initiate clinically relevant autoimmunity.

Mice were bred and maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions at an American Association for the Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC)-accredited animal facility within the NIAID. Mice were housed in accordance with the procedures outlined in the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Unless otherwise stated, sex and age-matched littermates (6-12 weeks of age) were used for individual experiments. For experiments involving Foxp3CreERT2 +/+ -CTLA4 +/fl and Foxp3CreERT2 +/− -Confetti fl/- animals, we used female mice exclusively. For all other experiments, male and female mice were used at equal ratios.
Peripheral LNs and spleens from donor mice were homogenized in ice cold PBS supplemented with 1% BSA and 2mM EDTA. Cell suspensions were subsequently filtered through a 70 μm cell strainer. CD4 + T cell isolation was achieved by magnetic bead-based negative selection following the manufacturer’s protocol (Miltenyi Biotec, Cat#: 130-104-454). Note that the standard cocktail of biotin-conjugated antibodies was supplemented with biotin-conjugated anti-IL-2R-α (clone 7D4, 5 μg/mL) to remove highly activated CD4 + T cells and Tregs. 5 × 10 4 or 1 × 10 5 CD4 + T cells were transferred into individual recipient mice by intravenous (i.v.) injection.
Where indicated, purified CD4 + T cells were labeled with one of the following fluorescent dyes prior to adoptive transfer: 1 μM CellTracker Deep Red, 1 μM CellTracker Green, 1 μM CellTrace Violet, or 1 μM CellTrace Yellow. Dyes were diluted in PBS and cell labeling was performed for 20 min at 22°C with gentle end-over-end rotation. Unbound dye was quenched by washing cells 2x in PBS supplemented with 1% BSA.
For long term tracking experiments, CD45.2 +/+ donor T cells were transferred into congenic CD45.1 +/+ recipients. After 24 h, recipient animals were administered 100 μg of anti-CD62L blocking antibody (clone Mel-14) and 20 μg of FTY720 (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat#: SML0700) daily by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection for up to 7 consecutive days.
For experiments involving the IL-2:S4B61 complex, 0.5 μg of recombinant murine IL-2 was incubated with 5 μg of anti-IL-2 antibody (clone S4B61) in PBS for 20 minutes at room temperature. The complex was then injected into recipient animals at the indicated time points.
In some instances, recipient animals were administered 500 μg of I-A b blocking antibody (clone M5/114).
5C.C7 T cells were harvested from transgenic 5C.C7 Rag2 −/− animals. In parallel, splenocytes were harvested from WT B10.A animals, labeled with 5 μM CellTrace Violet, and pulsed with indicated peptides for 6 h at 37°C. 3x10 5 splenocytes were then incubated with 1x10 5 5C.C7 cells in individual wells of V bottom 96 well plates. After 12, 24, 36, or 60 h, plates were centrifuged, and cells were washed in cold MACS buffer. Next, cells were incubated with the IL-2 catch reagent (Miltenyi Biotec, Cat#: 130-090-491) for 5 mins on ice and subsequently transferred to a deep well plate with warm RPMI. The plate was glue-sealed with plastic film and rotated for 45 min at 37°C. Plates were then centrifuged and cells were washed twice in MACS buffer prior to immunostaining with the PE-conjugated anti-IL-2 detection reagent (Miltenyi Biotec, Cat#: 130-090-491), FITC-conjugated anti-CD4 (clone RM4-5), and BV785-conjugated anti-PD-1 (clone J43). Fluorescence measurements were made using flow cytometry.
Digital images were acquired using an upright or inverted Leica TCS SP8 X spectral detection system (Leica) equipped with a pulsed white light laser, 4 Gallium-Arsenide Phosphide (GaAsP) Hybrid Detectors (HyDs), 1 photomultiplier tube (PMT), 40x (NA = 1.3) and 20x (NA = 0.75) oil immersion objective lenses, and a motorized stage. For tissue sections (18-50 μm), images were acquired using the 40x objective with a pixel size of 0.271-0.286 μm, z step size of 0.3-1 μm, and detector bit-depth of 12.
For cleared, whole organ imaging, acquisition was performed on the inverted system using the 20x objective with a 2x optical zoom, pixel size of 0.286 μm, z step size of 2 μm, and detector bit-depth of 8. In all experiments, image acquisition was controlled using LAS X software.
Relevant LNs were quickly harvested and fixed for 14h at 4°C in BD Cytoperm/Cytofix (BD Bioscience, Cat#: 554722) diluted 1/4 in PBS. LNs were washed 3x in PBS (10 min per wash), carefully trimmed of fat using a stereo dissection microscope and fine forceps, and dehydrated for 24 h in a 30% sucrose solution made in 0.1 M phosphate buffer. LNs were then embedded in optimal cutting temperature (O.C.T.) compound (Sakura Finetek, Cat#: 50-363-579), frozen on dry ice, and stored at −80°C. 18-50 μm sagittal LN sections were prepared using a cryostat (Leica) equipped with a Surgipath DB80LX blade (Leica, Cat#: 14035843497). Cryochamber and Specimen cooling was set to −17°C.
To detect endogenous IL-2 production, animals were euthanized and quickly subjected to cardiac perfusion fixation. Animals were perfused with 2% PFA at a rate of 5ml/min for 3 minutes. Relevant LNs were then harvested and post-fixed in 1% BD Cytoperm/Cytofix for 14h at 4°C. LN storage and preparation was performed as described above.
Tissue sections were adhered to Superfrost Plus microscopy slides (VWR, Cat#: 48311-703), permeabilized using 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min at 22°C, blocked in 5% mouse serum for 1 h at 22°C, and washed in PBS. Tissue sections were next incubated with directly conjugated primary antibodies (see STAR Methods for working concentrations) diluted in PBS for 15 h at 4°C. After washing 3x in PBS (10 min per wash) at 22°C, samples were mounted in Fluoromount-G (SouthernBiotech, Cat#: 0100-01), which was allowed to cure for a minimum of 14h at 22°C. All imaging was performed using No. 1.5 coverglass (VWR, Cat#: 48393-241). Combinations of the following organic fluorophores were used for immunostaining: Brilliant Violet 421, Brilliant Violet 480, Alexa Fluor 555, eFluor 570, Alexa Fluor 594, eFluor660, Alexa Fluor 647, Alexa Fluor 488, and Alexa Fluor 700.
For pSTAT5 immunostaining, fixed tissue sections were permeabilized in pre-chilled 100% methanol for 18 min at −20°C, washed extensively in PBS, blocked in 5% donkey serum for 1 h at 22°C, and washed further in PBS. Tissue sections were next incubated with unconjugated anti-pSTAT5 (clone C11C5, 1.715 μg/ml) diluted in PBS for 15 h at 4°C. Following washing in PBS at 22°C, tissue sections were incubated with either Alexa 488, Alexa 594, or Alexa 647-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit F(ab’) 2 fragments (0.483 μg/ml, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc, Cat#: 711-546-152 or 711-6060152) for 2h at 22°C. Sections were then washed 4x in PBS (10 min per wash) at 22°C prior to mounting in Fluoromount-G as described above.
Tissue preparation, immunostaining, and clearing was performed using a protocol adapted from Li et al. (2017) 57. Li, W. ∙ Germain, R.N. ∙ Gerner, M.Y. Multiplex, quantitative cellular analysis in large tissue volumes with clearing-enhanced 3D microscopy (C e 3D) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :E7321-E7330 Crossref Scopus (126) PubMed Google Scholar . In brief, relevant LNs were quickly harvested and fixed for 14h at 4°C in 1% paraformaldehyde. Following 3x washes in PBS (10 min per wash), LNs were incubated in a 100 mM glycine solution for 30 min to neutralize free aldehydes. Next, LNs were carefully trimmed of fat using a stereo dissection microscope and fine forceps. Individual LNs were then incubated in 1 mL of blocking buffer (PBS with 1% normal mouse serum, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% Triton X-100) at 22°C for ∼16 h with shaking (600 rpm). For immunostaining, each LN was incubated in a 400 μL staining buffer (PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100 and diluted antibodies of interest) for 3 days at 37°C with shaking (220 rpm). The following directly conjugated primary antibodies were used: eFluor 570-conjugated anti-Foxp3 (clone FJK-16 s, 2 μg/ml), Alexa 647-conjugated anti-CD45.2 (clone 104, 5 μg/ml), and Alexa 488-conjugated anti-GFP (polyclonal, 4 μg/ml). After immunostaining, each LN was washed in 1 mL of wash buffer (PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100) for 14 h at 37°C with shaking (220 rpm). A final wash was performed at 22°C for 4h with shaking (600 rpm) prior to clearing.
Tissue clearing was performed using Ce3D solution: 40% (v/v) N-methylacetamide (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat#: M26305), 80% (w/v) Histodenz (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat#: D2158), 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 0.5% (v/v) 1-thioglycerol (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat#: M1753). Individual LNs were incubated in 1 mL of Ce3D solution for 18-24 h at 22°C with gentle end-over-end rotation. Prior to imaging, a stereo microscope was used to position each cleared LN with its hilum facing up on a No. 1.5 glass bottom microwell dish (MatTek, Cat#: P35G-1.5-20-C). Vacuum grease was then applied around the perimeter of the LN, creating a trough that was filled with a small volume of Ce3D solution. The trough was sealed by gently pressing an 18 mm, round coverglass on top of the vacuum grease.
Tamoxifen (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat#:10540-29-1) was dissolved in corn oil at a concentration of 20 mg/ml. Female Foxp3CreERT +/− -Confetti +/− , Foxp3CreERT2 +/− -IL2Rβ +/fl , and Foxp3CreERT2 +/+ -CTLA-4 +/fl animals were administered 100 μL of tamoxifen emulsion (∼75 mg tamoxifen/kg) or corn oil control daily by i.p. injection for 4 consecutive days. For Foxp3CreERT +/− -Confetti +/− mice, LNs were harvested 14 days after the final injection whereas for Foxp3CreERT2 +/− -IL2Rβ +/fl and Foxp3CreERT2 +/− -CTLA-4 +/fl mice, LNs were harvested 7 days after the final injection. Male and female Foxp3CreER2 +/+ -TCR-α fl/fl animals were injected with tamoxifen as described; LNs were harvested 5 days after the final injection.
500 ng of diphtheria toxin (Calbiochem, Cat# 322326) was diluted in PBS and administered to Foxp3-DTR +/+ by i.p. injection. PBS alone was used as a control. LNs were harvest 7h later. All LNs were prepared for imaging as described in “Tissue section preparation, processing, and immunostaining” section.
To ablate bone marrow, adult C57BL/6J.Ly5a recipient animals were exposed to two doses of 137 -Cesium-generated, 6 Gy gamma rays. Each dose of radiation was separated by a 3 h rest period. Donor bone marrow was extracted from C57BL/6J, C57BL/6-Ubi-GFP +/+ , and Foxp3-DTR +/+ animals, mixed at different ratios, and injected intravenously into irradiated recipients immediately following the second rest period. Recipient animals were then treated with neomycin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for 4 weeks. Experiments were performed 10 weeks after the initial irradiation. To assess global chimerism, eGFP expression was measured in Treg cells from blood samples by flow cytometry. To assess local chimerism in situ , eGFP expression was measured in LNs within regions of high and low Treg cell density by quantitative imaging.
Donor bone marrow was extracted from the femurs and tibias of C57BL/6J, C57BL/6-Ubi-GFP +/+ , and Foxp3-DTR +/+ animals by PBS perfusion with a 21-gauge needle. The resulting cell suspensions were filtered through a 40 μm cell-strainer prior to i.v. injection.
Image files generated in LAS X software were converted into “.ims” files in Imaris software (Bitplane) and subjected to a 1 pixel Gaussian filter to reduce noise.
For tissue sections, segmentation of densely packed T cells was performed using a protocol modified from Li et al. (2017) 57. Li, W. ∙ Germain, R.N. ∙ Gerner, M.Y. Multiplex, quantitative cellular analysis in large tissue volumes with clearing-enhanced 3D microscopy (C e 3D) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :E7321-E7330 Crossref Scopus (126) PubMed Google Scholar . This process involved creating artificial T cell nuclei, which in turn were subjected to segmentation algorithms. In brief, “.ims” files were initially imported into Fiji ( Schindelin et al., 2012 81. Schindelin, J. ∙ Arganda-Carreras, I. ∙ Frise, E. ... Fiji: an open-source platform for biological-image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :676-682 Crossref Scopus (21959) PubMed Google Scholar ). Note that Fiji imports 12-bit images in a 16-bit format. The brightness and contrast of CD3 or, in some instances, CD4 channels were adjusted linearly to thinly demarcate the plasma membranes of T cells. Adjusted CD3 or CD4 channels were then converted into an 8-bit format, duplicated and inverted to create an inverted sum channel. Next, the original channel was subtracted from the inverted sum channel, producing a high-contrast inverted channel, which was subsequently binarized using the “Auto Local Thresholding” tool. We employed the median algorithm with a local domain radius value (in pixels) that approximated the radius of a T cell (∼3.5 μm). Binarized images were then despeckled to remove noise and subtracted from the inverted sum channel to improve separation between artificial T cell nuclei. The final product was converted back to a 16-bit format, exported as a “.TIFF” image sequence, and imported into the original “.ims” file in Imaris.
Image segmentation was performed in Imaris using the “Surface Object Creation” module, which employs a seeded region growing, k-means, and watershed algorithm to define individual cells. Segmentation artifacts were excluded using a combination of sphericity and volume thresholds, as well as manual correction.
For experiments involving Foxp3CreERT2 +/− -Confetti fl/- animals treated with tamoxifen, FP signals were masked in Imaris to improve visual clarity.
Following T cell segmentation and surface creation (see “Image processing and segmentation”), the mean or summed voxel fluorescence intensity values per channel were assessed in Imaris. In certain instances, these fluorescence distributions were used to selectively visualize T cells with specific phenotypes by creating discrete thresholds using the “filter” tool. Individual T cell statistics, including XYZ positional data —which were based on cell centroids — fluorescence intensity values per channel, and volume measurements were exported as .csv files and imported into the R statistical environment for further analysis.
To estimate the extent of T cell division in situ , an automated computational method was employed. In brief, the mclust package was used to fit a finite Gaussian mixture model via the EM algorithm, which was initialized by hierarchical model-based agglomerative clustering. The optimal model and number of mixture components was then selected using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) ( Scrucca et al., 2016 83. Scrucca, L. ∙ Fop, M. ∙ Murphy, T.B. ... mclust 5: Clustering, Classification and Density Estimation Using Gaussian Finite Mixture Models R J. 2016; 8 :289-317 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ).
Unsupervised hierarchical clustering was performed using the pheatmap package. Cells were clustered based on their Pearson correlation in multidimensional space using Ward’s minimum variance method.
Segmented imaging data were treated as realizations of multivariate, marked point patterns in two-dimensional ℝ 2 or three-dimensional space ℝ 3 ( Baddeley et al., 2015 10. Baddeley, A. ∙ Rubak, E. ∙ Turner, R. Spatial Point Patterns: Methodology and Applications with R Chapman and Hall/CRC Press, 2015 Crossref Google Scholar ). Associated marks were both categorical and numerical in value. All nearest neighbor distances were calculated in three-dimensional space using the nncross.pp3 function in Spatstat. To visualize the probability density function of Tregs throughout the LN, we extracted the XY coordinates of these cells from thin 18 μm LN sections and performed a fixed-bandwidth kernel density estimation. The smoothing bandwidth (σ) was estimated by cross-validation using the bw.diggle function in the Spatstat package ( Baddeley and Turner, 2005 9. Baddeley, A. ∙ Turner, R. spatstat: An R Package for Analyzing Spatial Point Patterns J. Stat. Softw. 2005; 12 :1-42 Crossref Google Scholar ; Baddeley et al., 2015 10. Baddeley, A. ∙ Rubak, E. ∙ Turner, R. Spatial Point Patterns: Methodology and Applications with R Chapman and Hall/CRC Press, 2015 Crossref Google Scholar ). In brief, σ was chosen to minimize the mean-square error criterion according to Berman and Diggle (1989) 14. Berman, M. ∙ Diggle, P. Estimating Weighted Integrals of the Second-Order Intensity of a Spatial Point Process J. R. Stat. Soc. Series B Stat. Methodol. 1989; 51 :81-92 Google Scholar and Diggle (1985) 26. Diggle, P. A Kernel Method for Smoothing Point Process Data J. R. Stat. Soc. Ser. C Appl. Stat. 1985; 34 :138-147 Google Scholar . The kernel density estimation was calculated using the stat_density2d function in the ggplot2 package.
To automatically detect TxA23 cell clusters, we employed an implementation of the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm using the dbscan package. The epsilon neighborhood (eps) using a k-dimensional tree to find k-nearest neighbors among the Tregs and their distances. These distances were then plotted as a function of Tregs sorted by ascending distance in the dataset, and the optimal eps was chosen based on the “knee” in the plot (i.e., the inflection point)
To visualize the empirical density (commonly referred to as intensity in spatial point patterns) of Tregs weighted to the expression of Ki67, we performed a fixed-bandwidth kernel estimate of the intensity function. This function computes the convolution of the isotropic Gaussian kernel with standard deviation, σ. σ was estimated as described above. The intensity function was estimated using XY coordinates from thin, 18 μm LN sections. The intensity value at a point 𝑢 is: ̂ 𝜆 ⁡ ( 𝑢 ) = ∑ 𝑖 𝑘 ⁢ ( 𝑥 𝑖 − 𝑢 ) ⁢ 𝜔 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁡ ( 𝑥 𝑖 ) where 𝑘 is the Gaussian smooth kernel, 𝑒 ⁡ ( 𝑥 𝑖 ) is an edge correction factor, and 𝜔 𝑖 are the Ki67 weights. The edge correction term, 𝑒 ⁡ ( 𝑢 ) is defined as follows ( Diggle, 2013 27. Diggle, P.J. Statistical Analysis of Spatial and Spatio-Temporal Point Patterns CRC Press, 2013 Crossref Scopus (228) Google Scholar ; Jones, 1993 49. Jones, M.C. Simple boundary correction for kernel density estimation Stat. Comput. 1993; 3 :135-146 Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ): 1 𝑒 ⁡ ( 𝑢 ) = ∫ 𝑊 𝑘 ⁢ ( 𝑣 − 𝑢 ) 𝑑 𝑣 where W is the observation window, which was defined using the clickpoly function in the Spatstat package.
To correlate Ki67 expression in Tregs with intercellular distance, we implemented Stoyan’s mark correlation function: 𝑘 ⁡ [ 𝑚 ⁡ 𝑚 ⁡ ( 𝑟 ) ] = 𝐸 ⁡ [ 0 ⁢ 𝑢 ] ⁢ ( 𝑀 ⁡ ( 0 ) ∗ 𝑀 ⁡ ( 𝑢 ) ) / 𝐸 ⁡ ( 𝑀 ∗ 𝑀 ′ ) where 𝐸 ⁡ [ 0 ⁢ 𝑢 ] is the conditional expectation for two points, 0 and 𝑢 , separated by r and 𝑀 ⁡ ( 0 ) and 𝑀 ⁡ ( 𝑢 ) ) represents the marks (i.e., the Ki67 values) associated with these two points. 𝐸 ⁢ ( 𝑀 ∗ 𝑀 ′ ) is the expectation for random marks, M and M’, drawn independently from the marginal distribution of Ki67 values. Pointwise envelopes for Stoyan’s mark correlation function were computed using the envelope function in Spatstat. For the null hypothesis ( H 0 ), the observed Ki67 marks were permutated at random across the fixed positions of Tregs within the LN paracortex using the rlabel function.
A similar permutation approach was used to quantify Treg clusters in the Foxp3CreERT2 +/− -Confetti fl/- animals treated with tamoxifen. Single-FP Treg clusters were quantified in three-dimensional space using the pointdensity function in the dbscan package. We excluded GFP from downstream analysis due to nearly negligible expression in Tregs — a well-documented consequence of weak Cre recombinase expression ( Snippert et al., 2010 91. Snippert, H.J. ∙ van der Flier, L.G. ∙ Sato, T. ... Intestinal crypt homeostasis results from neutral competition between symmetrically dividing Lgr5 stem cells Cell. 2010; 143 :134-144 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1176) PubMed Google Scholar )
To calculate the local density of Tregs (λ Treg ) surrounding individual T cells, we employed a moving window analysis. In brief, we initially centered a 1 μm spherical shell on a T cell of interest. The shell was then advanced radially up to a distance of 100 μm; the number of Tregs was enumerated within each 1 μm interval. We then calculated the volume at each interval, but only included proportions of each shell that fell within the boundaries of the LN (i.e., edge-corrected volumes). These boundaries were determined by centering a complete sphere with a radius of 1 μm on the T cell of interest and expanding it up to a radius of 100 μm. To determine the intersections between the expanding sphere and the LN boundaries, we used a customized R wrapper function of the Boolean operation from the CGAL library. Next, the volumes of these intersections were computed using a customized R wrapper function of the volume operation from the libigl library. Finally, the volume of each shell was calculated by subtracting the volume of two adjacent spheres. After determining the edge-corrected volume of each shell, along with the number of Tregs within each shell, we applied a 5 μm moving window in which local Treg density was calculated; the window was advanced radially from the T cell of interest up to a distance of 100 μm. At each window position, we calculated the density of Tregs by dividing the summed Treg numbers by the summed volumes of 5 adjacent shells, accounting for noise due to uncertainty in determining the centroid and size of each segmented cell ( https://github.com/pkm304/density_moving_window ).
We describe a detailed model of the interactions between three cell types: conventional CD4+ T cells (Tconvs), regulatory T cells (Tregs), and dendritic cells (DCs). The variables and parameters of the model can be found in Tables S1 and S2 .

We assumed the expression level of CD28 in the plasma membrane of Tconvs remains fixed. The cycling of CTLA4 is maintained at steady state for Tregs. Also, once the complexes of CTLA4 and CD80|CD86 are internalized, the complexes are instantly degraded.
Equations.
Tconvs. We assumed that the Tconv:DC engagement ceases before the considerable accumulation of CTLA4 by the Tconv. Thus, 𝑅 𝐶 ⁢ 𝑇 ⁢ 𝐿 ⁢ 𝐴 ⁢ 4 = 0 for the whole time. 𝑑 ⁢ 𝐶 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑚 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑡 = 𝑘 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑛 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑚 ⁢ ( 𝐿 𝐶 ⁢ 𝐷 ⁢ 8 0 | 𝐶 ⁢ 𝐷 ⁢ 8 6 𝑆 𝐷 ⁢ 𝐶 − 𝐶 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑚 ) ⁢ ( 𝑅 𝐶 ⁢ 𝐷 ⁢ 2 8 𝑆 𝑇 − 𝐶 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑚 ) − 𝑘 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑓 ⁢ 𝑓 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑚 ⁢ 𝐶 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑚 . At steady state, 𝐶 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑚 = 1 2 ⁢ ( 𝑅 𝐶 ⁢ 𝐷 ⁢ 2 8 / 𝑆 𝑇 + + 𝐿 𝐶 ⁢ 𝐷 ⁢ 8 0 | 𝐶 ⁢ 𝐷 ⁢ 8 6 / 𝑆 𝐷 ⁢ 𝐶 + 𝑘 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑓 ⁢ 𝑓 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑚 / 𝑘 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑛 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑚 − √ ( 𝑅 𝐶 ⁢ 𝐷 ⁢ 2 8 / 𝑆 𝑇 + 𝐿 𝐶 ⁢ 𝐷 ⁢ 8 0 | 𝐶 ⁢ 𝐷 ⁢ 8 6 / 𝑆 𝐷 ⁢ 𝐶 + 𝑘 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑓 ⁢ 𝑓 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑚 / 𝑘 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑛 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑚 ) 2 − 4 ⁢ 𝑅 𝐶 ⁢ 𝐷 ⁢ 2 8 / 𝑆 𝑇 ⋅ 𝐿 𝐶 ⁢ 𝐷 ⁢ 8 0 | 𝐶 ⁢ 𝐷 ⁢ 8 6 / 𝑆 𝐷 ⁢ 𝐶 ) . 𝐶 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑚 was assumed to be the determinant of immune synapse formation. If 𝐶 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑚 falls below a threshold value of 5 during the simulation or alternatively, if the simulation time exceeds 48 hours, the Tconv stops receiving TCR and costimulatory signals and disengages from the DC.
Tregs. We assumed that Tregs maintain a constant CTLA4 level in their cell membranes. This assumption slightly underestimates the actual value during active negative feedback regulation, given our data that IL-2 signaling increases CTLA4 expression by Tregs. 𝑑 ⁢ 𝐶 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑚 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑡 = 𝑘 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑛 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑚 ⁢ ( 𝐿 𝐶 ⁢ 𝐷 ⁢ 8 0 | 𝐶 ⁢ 𝐷 ⁢ 8 6 𝑆 𝐷 ⁢ 𝐶 − 𝐶 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑚 − 𝐶 𝐶 ⁢ 𝑇 ⁢ 𝐿 ⁢ 𝐴 ⁢ 4 ) ⁢ ( 𝑅 𝐶 ⁢ 𝐷 ⁢ 2 8 𝑆 𝑇 − 𝐶 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑚 ) − 𝑘 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑓 ⁢ 𝑓 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑚 ⁢ 𝐶 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑚 , 𝑑 ⁢ 𝐶 𝐶 ⁢ 𝑇 ⁢ 𝐿 ⁢ 𝐴 ⁢ 4 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑡 = 𝑘 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑛 𝐶 ⁢ 𝑇 ⁢ 𝐿 ⁢ 𝐴 ⁢ 4 ⁢ ( 𝐿 𝐶 ⁢ 𝐷 ⁢ 8 0 | 𝐶 ⁢ 𝐷 ⁢ 8 6 𝑆 𝐷 ⁢ 𝐶 − 𝐶 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑚 − 𝐶 𝐶 ⁢ 𝑇 ⁢ 𝐿 ⁢ 𝐴 ⁢ 4 ) ⁢ ( 𝑅 𝐶 ⁢ 𝑇 ⁢ 𝐿 ⁢ 𝐴 ⁢ 4 𝑆 𝑇 − 𝐶 𝐶 ⁢ 𝑇 ⁢ 𝐿 ⁢ 𝐴 ⁢ 4 ) − 𝑘 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑓 ⁢ 𝑓 𝐶 ⁢ 𝑇 ⁢ 𝐿 ⁢ 𝐴 ⁢ 4 ⁢ 𝐶 𝐶 ⁢ 𝑇 ⁢ 𝐿 ⁢ 𝐴 ⁢ 4 − 𝑘 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑜 𝐶 ⁢ 𝑇 ⁢ 𝐿 ⁢ 𝐴 ⁢ 4 ⁢ 𝐶 𝐶 ⁢ 𝑇 ⁢ 𝐿 ⁢ 𝐴 ⁢ 4 .

Detailed description of trans-endocytosis of CD80|CD86 by Tregs. We further implemented the regulation of the trans-endocytosis efficiency by costimulation with the assumption that costimulation strength upregulates the trans-endocytosis efficiency. This assumption was based on the fact that CD28 signaling increases the adhesion of T cells to DCs and therefore, is likely to increase the efficiency of CTLA-4-mediated trans-endocytosis ( Thauland et al., 2014 99.

Treg movement . There are three possible mechanisms of the dynamical spatiotemporal regulation of Treg density: 1) chemo-attraction or chemo-repulsion due to cytokines or chemokines secreted by responding Tconvs or DCs ( Chavanis, 2009 21.

Time evolution of internal states of Tregs. The internal states of Tregs evolve over time upon receiving signals from secreted IL-2 or other sources such costimulatory ligands or pMHCII of DCs. We developed a general mathematical description of the internal dynamics of an entity described as a frequency using PDEs. In general, the number density of a molecular species R in Tregs is written as 𝑛 𝑅 = 𝑅 ⋅ 𝑛 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑟 , where 𝑅 is the number of a molecular species per cell. Then, the time evolution of 𝑛 𝑅 is described as ∂ 𝑛 𝑅 ∂ 𝑡 = ∂ 𝑅 ∂ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑛 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑟 + 𝑅 ⁢ ∂ 𝑛 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑟 ∂ 𝑡 = ( 𝑓 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑑 + 𝑓 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑔 ) ⁢ 𝑛 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑟 + 𝑛 𝑅 𝑛 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ ∂ 𝑛 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑟 ∂ 𝑡 , where 𝑓 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑑 and 𝑓 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑔 are production and degradation rates of R, respectively. The suitable form this equation for implementing in the pdepe function of the MATLAB software is 𝑛 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑟 𝑛 𝑅 ⁢ ∂ 𝑛 𝑅 ∂ 𝑡 = 𝑛 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑟 2 𝑛 𝑅 ⁢ ( 𝑓 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑑 + 𝑓 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑔 ) + ∂ 𝑛 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑟 ∂ 𝑡 = ∇ ⋅ ( 𝑛 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ ( 1 − 𝑛 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑟 𝐾 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑐 ) ⁢ ( ∇ 𝑈 − 𝜒 0 ∇ 𝑎 ) + 𝐷 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑟 ∇ 𝑛 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑟 ) + 𝑛 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑟 2 𝑛 𝑅 ⁢ ( 𝑓 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑑 + 𝑓 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑔 ) + 𝑘 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑓 𝐼 ⁢ 𝐿 ⁢ 2 → 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑔 ⁢ 𝑃 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑛 𝐽 ⁢ 𝐴 ⁢ 𝐾 → 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑆 ⁢ 𝑇 ⁢ 𝐴 ⁢ 𝑇 ⁢ 5 , 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑟 ( 𝐾 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑓 𝐼 ⁢ 𝐿 ⁢ 2 → 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑔 + 𝑃 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑛 𝐽 ⁢ 𝐴 ⁢ 𝐾 → 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑆 ⁢ 𝑇 ⁢ 𝐴 ⁢ 𝑇 ⁢ 5 , 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑟 ) ⁢ 𝑛 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ ( 1 − 𝑛 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑟 𝐾 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑐 ) , where 𝑐 ≡ 𝑛 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑟 𝑛 𝑅 , 𝑓 ≡ 𝑛 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ ( 1 − 𝑛 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑟 𝐾 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑐 ) ⁢ ( ∇ 𝑈 − 𝜒 0 ∇ 𝑎 ) + 𝐷 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑟 ∇ 𝑛 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑟 , 𝑠 ≡ 𝑛 2 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑟 𝑛 𝑅 ⁢ ( 𝑓 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑑 + 𝑓 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑔 ) + 𝑘 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑓 𝐼 ⁢ 𝐿 ⁢ 2 → 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑔 ⁢ 𝑃 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑛 𝐽 ⁢ 𝐴 ⁢ 𝐾 → 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑆 ⁢ 𝑇 ⁢ 𝐴 ⁢ 𝑇 ⁢ 5 , 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑟 ( 𝐾 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑓 𝐼 ⁢ 𝐿 ⁢ 2 → 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑔 + 𝑃 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑛 𝐽 ⁢ 𝐴 ⁢ 𝐾 → 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑆 ⁢ 𝑇 ⁢ 𝐴 ⁢ 𝑇 ⁢ 5 , 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑟 ) ⁢ 𝑛 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ ( 1 − 𝑛 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑟 𝐾 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑐 ) .

Most of model parameters were obtained from existing previous literature (see Tables S1 and S2 for detailed descriptions and references of parameters). While parameters related to ligand-receptor binding kinetics could be obtained from the literature, parameters related to Hill functions connecting upstream signals and downstream effects could not be determined since they are phenomenological descriptions and subject to cell-cell heterogeneities, even under shared environments. Initial conditions of model variables (such as the initial level of CD80|CD86 or initial density of Tregs) can be considered as parameters externally provided. However, these values also vary significantly during homeostatic conditions. Therefore, simulating the model under a few fixed parameter combinations cannot account for phenotypic variations of the T cell response, leading us to apply the MAPPA framework outlined below.
MAPPA is a computational framework that uses Random Forests to build quantitative maps between parameter space and phenotypic space for complicated models with analytical intractability ( Park et al., 2019 73. Park, K. ∙ Prüstel, T. ∙ Lu, Y. ... Machine learning of stochastic gene network phenotypes bioRxiv. 2019; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). This framework determines the contribution of individual parameters sampled throughout the plausible parameter space on a range of phenotypes, both at the global level (i.e., across all configurations in the parameter space), or local level (i.e., across specific configurations in the parameter space only). For our studies, the plausible parameter space was constructed using homeostatic parameter value ranges (see Table S1 ). We did not factor in the effects of inflammation on certain parameters (i.e., increased CD80|86 ranges on a DC). Within these parameter ranges, we sampled 20,000 parameter combinations using the Sobol’ sampling scheme, which, when compared to a pseudorandom sampling scheme, ensures uniform coverage of high-dimensional space.
Simulations were conducted using the MATLAB software for each parameter combination. The simulation time was from 0 to 120 hours reflecting the typical timescale of the T cell response. The units of variables were set to be either copy numbers for intracellular species or copy numbers per 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑚 3 for extracellular species. The units of parameters were converted to those compatible with the units of variables. MATLAB code is available on Github ( https://github.com/pkm304/multiscale_t_cell_activation )
ODEs and PDEs were connected with boundary conditions at the interface of spatial compartments ( Figure 6 A). By utilizing the separation of timescales between gene expression dynamics occurring over hours and spatial dynamics of cell movement and IL-2 diffusion reaching stationary states over minutes, we were able to use the built-in ODE and PDE solvers (ode45 and pdepe, respectively) of MATLAB, rather than creating a new simulation scheme. We decomposed each simulation of ODEs and PDEs into 5-minute intervals, which is the optimal separation of timescales. For each 5-minute interval, the initial boundary conditions were based on the simulation results from the previous time interval.
No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample sizes. Statistical details for all experiments can be found in the Figure legends. Single-cell empirical distributions were compared using the two-tailed Kolmogorov Smirnov (KS) test. Two sample groups were compared with Welch’s two.sided t test. Multiple groups were compared using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test with the Tukey correction for multiple comparisons. Local regressions were determined using the locally estimated scatterplot smoothing (LOESS) method. The k values in each figure legend represent the number of cells while the n values represent the number of animals. All analysis was performed in the R statistical environment.
