Title: Tumor-Derived Retinoic Acid Regulates Intratumoral Monocyte Differentiation to Promote Immune Suppression


Abstract: Summary

The immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) is a major barrier to immunotherapy. Within solid tumors, why monocytes preferentially differentiate into immunosuppressive tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) rather than immunostimulatory dendritic cells (DCs) remains unclear. Using multiple murine sarcoma models, we find that the TME induces tumor cells to produce retinoic acid (RA), which polarizes intratumoral monocyte differentiation toward TAMs and away from DCs via suppression of DC-promoting transcription factor Irf4. Genetic inhibition of RA production in tumor cells or pharmacologic inhibition of RA signaling within TME increases stimulatory monocyte-derived cells, enhances T cell-dependent anti-tumor immunity, and synergizes with immune checkpoint blockade. Furthermore, an RA-responsive gene signature in human monocytes correlates with an immunosuppressive TME in multiple human tumors. RA has been considered as an anti-cancer agent, whereas our work demonstrates its tumorigenic capability via myeloid-mediated immune suppression and provides proof of concept for targeting this pathway for tumor immunotherapy.

Section: Introduction

Tumor immunity involves the capture and processing of tumor antigens by antigen presenting cells (APCs), migration of APCs to draining lymph nodes to prime T cells, and migration of primed T cells to the tumor where they exert cytotoxic anti-tumor effects ( Chen and Mellman, 2013 10. Chen, D.S. ∙ Mellman, I. Oncology meets immunology: the cancer-immunity cycle Immunity. 2013; 39 :1-10 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (4741) PubMed Google Scholar ). APCs are important at multiple steps; dendritic cells (DCs) process tumor antigens to prime anti-tumor T cells, DCs and immunostimulatory tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) support T cell function, while immunosuppressive TAMs counteract T cell function ( Chen and Mellman, 2013 10. Chen, D.S. ∙ Mellman, I. Oncology meets immunology: the cancer-immunity cycle Immunity. 2013; 39 :1-10 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (4741) PubMed Google Scholar ). The TME promotes suppressive TAMs and inhibits DCs, impeding the generation and maintenance of functional anti-tumor T cells ( Veglia and Gabrilovich, 2017 53. Veglia, F. ∙ Gabrilovich, D.I. Dendritic cells in cancer: the role revisited Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2017; 45 :43-51 Crossref Scopus (333) PubMed Google Scholar ). Hence, identifying pathways that polarize APC distribution in the TME is critical for developing new approaches for cancer immunotherapy.
Macrophages originate from embryonic precursors or from circulating monocytes ( Haldar and Murphy, 2014 22. Haldar, M. ∙ Murphy, K.M. Origin, development, and homeostasis of tissue-resident macrophages Immunol. Rev. 2014; 262 :25-35 Crossref Scopus (87) PubMed Google Scholar ). Likewise, DCs differentiate from bone marrow-derived DC-precursors (conventional DCs or cDCs) or from circulating monocytes (monocyte-derived DCs or moDCs) ( Mildner and Jung, 2014 41. Mildner, A. ∙ Jung, S. Development and function of dendritic cell subsets Immunity. 2014; 40 :642-656 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (598) PubMed Google Scholar ). While cDCs are critical for antitumor immune responses, the role of moDCs in tumor immunity is less clear ( Veglia and Gabrilovich, 2017 53. Veglia, F. ∙ Gabrilovich, D.I. Dendritic cells in cancer: the role revisited Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2017; 45 :43-51 Crossref Scopus (333) PubMed Google Scholar ). Circulating monocytes are vastly more abundant than cDC precursors and under inflammatory conditions can differentiate into moDCs ( Merad et al., 2013 40. Merad, M. ∙ Sathe, P. ∙ Helft, J. ... The dendritic cell lineage: ontogeny and function of dendritic cells and their subsets in the steady state and the inflamed setting Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2013; 31 :563-604 Crossref Scopus (1742) PubMed Google Scholar ). Within solid tumors, however, monocytes preferentially generate immunosuppressive TAMs ( Richards et al., 2013 46. Richards, D.M. ∙ Hettinger, J. ∙ Feuerer, M. Monocytes and macrophages in cancer: development and functions Cancer Microenviron. 2013; 6 :179-191 Crossref Scopus (149) PubMed Google Scholar ). The molecular basis for this is largely unknown ( Salmon et al., 2019 47. Salmon, H. ∙ Remark, R. ∙ Gnjatic, S. ... Host tissue determinants of tumour immunity Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2019; 19 :215-227 Crossref Scopus (188) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Retinoic acid (RA) has established roles in development, including in the functional specification of peritoneal macrophages ( Gundra et al., 2017; Okabe and Medzhitov, 2014 21. Gundra, U.M. ∙ Girgis, N.M. ∙ Gonzalez, M.A. ... Vitamin A mediates conversion of monocyte-derived macrophages into tissue-resident macrophages during alternative activation Nat.

Tissue-specific signals control reversible program of localization and functional polarization of macrophages Cell. 2014; 157 :832-844 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (687) PubMed Google Scholar ). Despite diverse functions in immunity, RA is generally thought to promote tolerance via multiple immune cell types ( Erkelens and Mebius, 2017 16. Erkelens, M.N. ∙ Mebius, R.E. Retinoic Acid and Immune Homeostasis: A Balancing Act Trends Immunol. 2017; 38 :168-180 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (167) PubMed Google Scholar ). While some studies have reported that RA promotes DC differentiation, others have reached the opposite conclusion ( Jin et al., 2010; Mohty et al., 2003 26. Jin, C.-J. ∙ Hong, C.Y. ∙ Takei, M. ... All-trans retinoic acid inhibits the differentiation, maturation, and function of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells Leuk. Res. 2010; 34 :513-520 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar 42.

Haematol. 2003; 122 :829-836 Crossref Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar ). Similarly, although RA can induce Foxp3 + T regulatory cells and Arg1 producing anti-inflammatory macrophages, it has also been reported to promote anti-tumor Th1 or Th17 T cell responses and dampen myeloid-derived suppressor cell function ( Bhatt et al., 2014; Bhattacharya et al., 2016; Hill et al., 2008; Nefedova et al., 2007; Vellozo et al., 2017 3.

Immunol. 2017; 8 :1560 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ). Factors contributing to these conflicting results include the exclusive reliance on cell surface markers to represent cellular identity and function, the use of inconsistent or supra-physiological doses of RA in experimentation, and the presence of additional environmental factors that modulate RA’s effects ( Duester, 2017 14. Duester, G. Retinoic acid’s reproducible future Science. 2017; 358 :1395 Crossref Scopus (5) PubMed Google Scholar ). Further, the impact of RA on tumor-associated APCs remains unclear.
RA is generated from vitamin A-derivative retinol through a series of enzyme-catalyzed steps, the rate limiting step being the conversion of retinaldehyde to RA via retinaldehyde dehydrogenases ( Raldh1 , Raldh2 , or Raldh3 ) ( Duester, 2008 13. Duester, G. Retinoic acid synthesis and signaling during early organogenesis Cell. 2008; 134 :921-931 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (830) PubMed Google Scholar ). Raldh enzymes are highly expressed in many human tumors ( Khoury et al., 2012; Li et al., 2010, 2014; Marcato et al., 2015; Wei et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2013 29.

Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling identifies ALDH1A3 promoter methylation as a prognostic predictor in G-CIMP- primary glioblastoma Cancer Lett. 2013; 328 :120-125 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, given RA’s role as a pro-differentiation agent during development, the effect of RA to promote tumor cell differentiation and suppress tumor growth has been studied for decades, albeit with limited clinical translation outside of promyelocytic leukemia ( Tang and Gudas, 2011 51. Tang, X.-H. ∙ Gudas, L.J. Retinoids, retinoic acid receptors, and cancer Annu. Rev. Pathol. 2011; 6 :345-364 Crossref Scopus (477) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, solid tumors represent a complex niche comprising of many different cell types other than malignant cells ( Binnewies et al., 2018 5. Binnewies, M. ∙ Roberts, E.W. ∙ Kersten, K. ... Understanding the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) for effective therapy Nat. Med. 2018; 24 :541-550 Crossref Scopus (3362) PubMed Google Scholar ). Hence, we wanted to explore whether RA could act on immune cells in the TME to promote immune suppression and facilitate tumor growth.
Here, we uncover an important role of RA in regulating intratumoral APC distribution and anti-tumor immune responses in sarcomas. We find that TME-associated factors such as interleukin (IL)-13 induce RA production in sarcoma cells. Tumor-derived RA blocks monocyte differentiation into DCs within the TME, instead generating immunosuppressive TAMs. Blocking RA production in tumor cells or inhibiting RA signaling within the TME increases the frequency of immunostimulatory APCs and engenders anti-tumor immune responses, which show strong synergy with immune checkpoint blockade. Finally, using RA-induced gene signatures in human monocytes, we computed an “RA response score” to identify human tumors wherein this pathway may underlie tumor immune evasion. Hence, the decades-old paradigm of RA as an anti-tumor agent is context-dependent as our findings clearly show a pro-tumor effect of RA mediated via RA’s impact on anti-tumor immune responses.

Section: Results

Mononuclear phagocytes (MPs) have been extensively examined in many common tumors, but sparsely in sarcoma ( Broz and Krummel, 2015; Broz et al., 2014; Ehnman and Larsson, 2015; Laoui et al., 2011 7.

Mononuclear phagocyte heterogeneity in cancer: different subsets and activation states reaching out at the tumor site Immunobiology. 2011; 216 :1192-1202 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar ). Sarcomas have over 60 subtypes, but based on their underlying genetic aberrations can be broadly divided into: (1) translocations generating fusion oncogenes, (2) mutations in tumor suppressors or oncogenes, and (3) genomic instability without a consistent mutation ( Taylor et al., 2011 52. Taylor, B.S. ∙ Barretina, J. ∙ Maki, R.G. ... Advances in sarcoma genomics and new therapeutic targets Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2011; 11 :541-557 Crossref Scopus (330) PubMed Google Scholar ). We utilize a representative mouse model for each of these genetic categories: synovial sarcoma (SS) (driven by SYT-SSX fusion oncogene), undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS) (driven by loss of p53 and activation of KRAS), and fibrosarcoma (FS) (syngeneic transplant of sarcoma cell lines derived from methylcolanthrene induced murine fibrosarcomas) ( Haldar et al., 2007; Kirsch et al., 2007; Schreiber and Podack, 2009 23.

Cancer. 2009; 101 :381-386 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ).
In all three sarcoma models, monocytes and TAMs comprised the majority of intratumoral leukocytes ( Figures 1 A, S1 A, and S1C). In contrast, CD11b + DCs were rare and CD103 + DCs exceedingly rare ( Figures 1 B, S1 B, and S1C). To assess the impact of the different MP subsets on T cell proliferation, we isolated monocytes, TAMs, or DCs from tumors and co-cultured them with αCD3/28-stimulated splenic T cells ( Figure 1 C). DC isolation was greatly facilitated by use of the Zbtb46 GFP mouse that allowed clear distinction of DCs from TAMs ( Satpathy et al., 2012 48. Satpathy, A.T. ∙ Kc, W. ∙ Albring, J.C. ... Zbtb46 expression distinguishes classical dendritic cells and their committed progenitors from other immune lineages J. Exp. Med. 2012; 209 :1135-1152 Crossref Scopus (474) PubMed Google Scholar ). Both TAMs and monocytes suppressed T cell proliferation, with TAMs displaying greater suppression (∼2–3×) ( Figures 1 D, S1 D, and S1E). In contrast, DCs stimulated T cell proliferation ( Figure 1 E). Hence, the abundant TAMs were the most immunosuppressive MP cells in the sarcoma TME.
Studies in other solid tumors have shown monocytes to be a major source of TAMs ( Richards et al., 2013 46. Richards, D.M. ∙ Hettinger, J. ∙ Feuerer, M. Monocytes and macrophages in cancer: development and functions Cancer Microenviron. 2013; 6 :179-191 Crossref Scopus (149) PubMed Google Scholar ). To identify monocyte progenies in sarcoma, we performed monocyte lineage-tracing by generating FS tumors (syngeneic transplant) in LysM Cre : Rosa26 tdT hosts ( Abram et al., 2014 1. Abram, C.L. ∙ Roberge, G.L. ∙ Hu, Y. ... Comparative analysis of the efficiency and specificity of myeloid-Cre deleting strains using ROSA-EYFP reporter mice J. Immunol. Methods. 2014; 408 :89-100 Crossref Scopus (342) PubMed Google Scholar ). Monocytes generated the majority of TAMs but few DCs ( Figure S1 F). These findings were corroborated in a monocyte-deficient mouse model of UPS generated by breeding the UPS model to Ccr2 −/− mice ( Figures S1 G and S1H).
Monocyte subsets differ in their ability to generate DCs versus macrophages ( Briseño et al., 2016; Menezes et al., 2016; Olingy et al., 2019 6. Briseño, C.G. ∙ Haldar, M. ∙ Kretzer, N.M. ... Distinct Transcriptional Programs Control Cross-Priming in Classical and Monocyte-Derived Dendritic Cells Cell Rep. 2016; 15 :2462-2474 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (138) PubMed Google Scholar 39. Menezes, S. ∙ Melandri, D. ∙ Anselmi, G. ... The Heterogeneity of Ly6C hi Monocytes Controls Their Differentiation into iNOS + Macrophages or Monocyte-Derived Dendritic Cells Immunity. 2016; 45 :1205-1218 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (208) PubMed Google Scholar 45. Olingy, C.E. ∙ Dinh, H.Q. ∙ Hedrick, C.C. Monocyte heterogeneity and functions in cancer J. Leukoc. Biol. 2019; 106 :309-322 Crossref Scopus (335) PubMed Google Scholar ). Hence, skewed monocyte differentiation within TME may reflect selective recruitment of monocyte subsets that are primed for macrophage differentiation. Alternatively, factors in the TME may drive macrophage differentiation from “uncommitted” monocytes. To address this, we injected LysM Cre : Rosa26 tdT : Zbtb46 GFP bone marrow monocytes into FS tumors and analyzed their differentiation over time ( Figure 1 F). The vast majority of transplanted monocytes (tdT + cells) differentiated into TAMs but not DCs ( Figures 1 G and 1H). Next, we asked whether intratumoral monocytes retain the ability to differentiate into DCs by isolating tumor monocytes and culturing them ex vivo with DC promoting cytokines GM-CSF and IL-4 ( Figures 1 I and S1 I). In this setting, the vast majority of monocytes differentiated into DCs but not macrophages ( Figure 1 J). Further, we were able to detect the major monocyte subsets within sarcoma TME ( Figure S1 J). Taken together, these findings suggest that TME-associated factors promote monocyte differentiation into suppressive TAMs but not DCs.
To identify TME factors driving monocyte differentiation into TAMs, we performed microarray-based gene expression profiling of TAMs isolated from our murine sarcoma models. Compared to tissue-resident macrophages (Immgen), TAMs expressed higher cellular retinoic acid binding proteins (CRABPs) ( Figures 2 A, S2 A, and S2B). This was independently validated via qRT-PCR on monocytes, macrophages, and DCs isolated from tumors and normal tissues ( Figure S2 C). Gene expression profiling of bulk tumor also revealed higher expression of Raldh enzymes (that catalyze the rate-limiting step of RA production) compared to surrounding normal muscle ( Figure 2 B). To directly quantify RA, we performed liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry for the major bioactive isoform of RA, all- trans retinoic acid (ATRA), and found elevated ATRA in all three mouse sarcoma models compared to normal mesenchymal tissues ( Figure 2 C).
To identify the cellular source of RA in TME, we performed a fluorescence-based assay detecting enzymatic activity of aldehyde dehydrogenases (Aldh), a larger family of enzymes that includes Raldh ( Ginestier et al., 2009 18. Ginestier, C. ∙ Wicinski, J. ∙ Cervera, N. ... Retinoid signaling regulates breast cancer stem cell differentiation Cell Cycle. 2009; 8 :3297-3302 Crossref Scopus (176) PubMed Google Scholar ). RA production was largely restricted to tumor cells in all of our murine models ( Figures 2 D, S2 D, and S2E). To assess whether Aldh fluorescence is truly indicative of Raldh activity, we performed gene expression profiling on sorted Aldh + and Aldh − tumor cells. Raldh transcripts were the only members of the Aldh enzyme family that were upregulated (data not shown). Further, Raldh isoforms were differentially expressed between sarcoma subtypes, although all three isoforms have redundant catalytic functions ( Kumar et al., 2012 32. Kumar, S. ∙ Sandell, L.L. ∙ Trainor, P.A. ... Alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenases: retinoid metabolic effects in mouse knockout models Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1821 :198-205 Crossref Scopus (133) PubMed Google Scholar ) in the production of RA ( Figures 2 E and S2 F). These data demonstrate that tumor cells produce the vast majority of RA in sarcoma TME.
Only a subset of tumor cells exhibited RA production and FS tumor cells massively upregulated Raldh in vivo compared to in vitro , suggesting that RA production is induced by the TME ( Figure 2 F). To further address this, we isolated Aldh + (RA-producing) and Aldh − (RA-negative) tumor cells from FS tumors, cultured the cells separately for 7 days, and re-transplanted them each into syngeneic recipients ( Figure 2 G). RA-producing tumor cells ceased RA production in vitro ( Figure 2 H), and RA-negative cells regained the capacity to produce RA in vivo ( Figure 2 I), demonstrating that TME induces tumor cells to produce RA.
To identify TME factors that may induce RA production, we revisited the microarray data from Aldh + and Aldh − tumor cells. IL-13 receptor alpha 2 (IL13Rα2), which is known to be strongly induced by IL-13 signaling ( Suzuki et al., 2015 50. Suzuki, A. ∙ Leland, P. ∙ Joshi, B.H. ... Targeting of IL-4 and IL-13 receptors for cancer therapy Cytokine. 2015; 75 :79-88 Crossref Scopus (171) PubMed Google Scholar ), was significantly higher in Aldh + cells (confirmed by qPCR in sorted ALDH + versus ALDH − tumor cells) ( Figure 2 J). IL-13 (and to a lesser extent IL-4) treatment induced Raldh expression in murine sarcoma cells in vitro ( Figure 2 K). To abrogate IL-13 signaling, we generated IL13Rα1 knockout sarcoma cell lines using CRISPR-Cas9. IL13Rα1 KO tumor cells did not upregulate IL13Ra2 or Raldh3 upon exposure to IL-13 in vitro ( Figure 2 L). Correspondingly, transplanted IL13Rα1 KO tumor cells showed reduced Raldh3 ( Figure 2 M). Finally, we identified T cells as the primary source of IL-13 in TME, while the expression of IL-13 receptors was largely restricted to myeloid and tumor cells ( Figure S2 G). Taken together, these findings suggest that T cell-derived IL-13 can induce RA production by tumor cells.
The results above show high levels of RA in sarcomas and evidence of RA exposure in TAMs. Hence, we explored whether RA might impact monocyte differentiation in sarcoma TME. We utilized a well-established assay of in vitro monocyte differentiation with GM-CSF and IL-4 that yields a mixture of macrophages and DCs ( Helft et al., 2015 24. Helft, J. ∙ Böttcher, J. ∙ Chakravarty, P. ... GM-CSF Mouse Bone Marrow Cultures Comprise a Heterogeneous Population of CD11c(+)MHCII(+) Macrophages and Dendritic Cells Immunity. 2015; 42 :1197-1211 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (591) PubMed Google Scholar ). Addition of RA at the onset of culture impaired DC differentiation of both murine and human monocytes ( Figures 3 A and 3B). RA doses were based on published literature ( Duester, 2017 14. Duester, G. Retinoic acid’s reproducible future Science. 2017; 358 :1395 Crossref Scopus (5) PubMed Google Scholar ) and our finding that plasma RA ranges between ∼5–20 nM. The effects of RA were recapitulated by RAR agonist CH55 and blocked by pan-RAR inverse agonist BMS493, suggesting that RA acts on monocytes via the RAR signaling ( Figure 3 C). Conversely, RA promoted macrophage differentiation from both mouse and human monocytes ( Figures 3 D and 3E). These effects were even more striking when IL-13 was used instead of IL-4 ( Figures S3 A and S3B). A brief bioinformatics-based analysis of human tumors suggested that the levels of IL-13 may be higher than IL-4 in many solid tumors, including sarcomas ( Figure S3 C) ( Suzuki et al., 2015 50. Suzuki, A. ∙ Leland, P. ∙ Joshi, B.H. ... Targeting of IL-4 and IL-13 receptors for cancer therapy Cytokine. 2015; 75 :79-88 Crossref Scopus (171) PubMed Google Scholar ). Hence, IL-13 likely plays an important role in MP cell differentiation and function in the TME.
To examine whether RA impacts monocyte differentiation within tumors, we isolated tDT + GFP − intratumoral monocytes from FS tumors in LysM Cre : Rosa26 tdT : Zbtb46 GFP mice and cultured them with GM-CSF and IL-4 with or without RA. Consistent with results above, RA inhibited DC and promoted macrophage differentiation from tumor monocytes ( Figures 3 F, 3G, and S3 D). Notably, these effects of RA on monocyte differentiation were significantly augmented in the presence of tumor-conditioned media ( Figure S3 E).
Finally, we tested aforementioned effects of RA in the context of human cancer. Although most tumors tested produced very little RA in vitro , only inducing its production in vivo as described above, we found that hepatocellular carcinoma SNU398 expressed high levels of RALDH1 in vitro ( Figure S3 F). Thus, we co-cultured human monocytes with SNU398 in the presence or absence of BMS493. Consistent with our observations above, DC differentiation was suppressed in the presence of SNU398. Strikingly, BMS493 completely rescued this effect, suggesting that tumor-derived RA was largely responsible for the skewed monocyte differentiation ( Figure S3 G). Together, these results demonstrate that RA signaling inhibits tumor monocyte differentiation into DC and promotes differentiation into macrophage.
As TAMs are generally immunosuppressive, we examined RA’s impact on the immunosuppressive capacity of monocyte-derived APCs. GM-CSF and IL-4 differentiated APCs with αCD3/28 stimulated splenic T cells and measured T cell proliferation and activation. As expected, the addition of RA during monocyte differentiation enhanced APC suppressive function ( Figures 3 H and S3 H). The findings were reproduced in monocyte differentiation systems involving GM-CSF alone or with tumor condition media ( Figures S3 I–S3K). RA also endowed additional suppressive capability on differentiated macrophages generated by culturing monocytes with M-CSF ( Figures 3 I and S3 L). This finding was recapitulated in human macrophage T cell co-cultures ( Figure 3 J). Of note, the addition of RA to T cells in the absence of macrophages did not significantly impact T cell proliferation ( Figure S3 M), suggesting that RA-induced T cell suppression in co-cultures were largely mediated via macrophages. Together, these results demonstrated that RA polarizes monocyte differentiation toward suppressive APCs, and additionally induces suppressive functions on mature macrophages.
RA regulates gene expression by binding to retinoic acid receptor/retinoid X receptor (RAR/RXR) heterodimers ( Duester, 2008 13. Duester, G. Retinoic acid synthesis and signaling during early organogenesis Cell. 2008; 134 :921-931 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (830) PubMed Google Scholar ). Microarray-based gene expression profiling of mouse or human monocytes treated with RA revealed that RA induced key genes associated with macrophage differentiation while downregulating genes associated with moDC differentiation ( Figures 3 K and 3L). Notably, RA downregulated transcription factor Irf4 , which regulates monocyte differentiation into DCs ( Briseño et al., 2016; Lehtonen et al., 2005 6. Briseño, C.G. ∙ Haldar, M. ∙ Kretzer, N.M. ... Distinct Transcriptional Programs Control Cross-Priming in Classical and Monocyte-Derived Dendritic Cells Cell Rep. 2016; 15 :2462-2474 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (138) PubMed Google Scholar 34. Lehtonen, A. ∙ Veckman, V. ∙ Nikula, T. ... Differential expression of IFN regulatory factor 4 gene in human monocyte-derived dendritic cells and macrophages J. Immunol. 2005; 175 :6570-6579 Crossref Scopus (100) PubMed Google Scholar ). We further validated this via qPCR and confirmed that this effect was dependent on RAR signaling ( Figures 3 M and 3N). Similar to RA-treated wild-type (WT) APCs, Irf4 -deficient APCs (LysM Cre : Irf4 fl/fl ) demonstrated heightened T cell suppression ( Figure 3 O). Importantly, the addition of RA to Irf4 -deficient monocytes did not further enhance suppressive capacity of these APCs ( Figure 3 O). We also performed the complementary experiment of overexpressing Irf4 in human monocytes, which rescued RA-mediated suppression of DC differentiation ( Figure 3 P). Taken together, these findings suggest that RA impacts monocyte differentiation by regulating key transcription factors such as Irf4 .
Our data thus far show high levels of RA production by tumor cells and the ability of RA to generate immunosuppressive TAMs from monocytes. Hence, we next examined the impact of reducing tumor cell-derived RA on intratumoral APCs in vivo . Using CRISPR-Cas9, we generated a Raldh3 KO FS cell line, given that Raldh3 was specifically upregulated in RA producing FS cells in vivo . Deletion of Raldh3 resulted in compensatory increase in Raldh1 expression ( Figure S4 A). Thus, we generated a Raldh1/3 double KO (DKO) cell line, which showed >80% reduction in Raldh1 and Raldh3 transcripts ( Figure S4 B), modestly reduced Aldh enzymatic activity in vivo ( Figure S4 C), and significantly reduced ATRA levels compared to control tumors ( Figure S4 D). DKO tumors showed reduced TAMs and increased CD11b + DCs, while CD103 + DCs remained largely unchanged ( Figures 4 A, 4B, and S4 E). Notably, a significantly higher fraction of F4/80 + TAMs in DKO tumors were CD11c + MHCII + and expressed higher levels of activation markers CD40, CD86, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) ( Figures 4 C, S4 F, and S4G). We further characterized RA-driven changes in intratumoral leukocytes by using single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), comparing tumor-infiltrating CD45 + leukocytes in DKO to Cas9 control tumors ( Figure 4 D). The largest differences were observed in the myeloid compartment, with DKO tumors harboring reduced TAMs with immunosuppressive markers (TAM 1), increased TAMs with immunostimulatory markers (TAM 2), and increased DCs ( Figures 4 E–4G). Intriguingly, the majority of DCs expressed Ccr2 , suggesting a monocyte origin ( Figure 4 E). Consistent with reduction in immunosuppressive TAMs by scRNA-seq, we found that F4/80 + TAMs from DKO tumors were significantly less suppressive to T cell proliferation and activation ex vivo ( Figures 4 H, S4 H, and S4I). Of note, the distribution of blood neutrophils and monocytes were similar in mice harboring control or DKO tumors, suggesting that the effects of decreasing tumor cell RA production on immune responses are mostly confined to the TME ( Figures 4 I and S4 J).
Additional immunophenotyping revealed increased CD4 + T cells in DKO tumors ( Figures 4 J and S4 K). Importantly, both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells in DKO tumors produced more interferon gamma (IFNγ) compared to those from control tumors ( Figure 4 K). Concomitant with a more stimulatory myeloid and T cell compartment, DKO FS demonstrated markedly decreased tumor volume and weight, as well as extended survival ( Figures 5 A, 5B, S5 A, and S5B). The effects of Raldh1/3 DKO on immune cells and tumor size were also consistent in an intramuscular orthotropic transplant-based model, suggesting that the impact of RA deficiency is independent of the anatomical location of the tumor ( Figures S5 C–S5F). To confirm the role of RA in the observed effects with DKO tumors, we overexpressed Raldh2 in the Raldh1/3 DKO cells to restore RA production ( Figure S5 G). Overexpression of Raldh2 restored tumor growth in DKO FS ( Figure 5 C). Correspondingly, Raldh2 overexpression reversed the stimulatory myeloid compartment of DKO tumors ( Figure 5 D). Together, these findings show that reducing tumor cell RA production engenders stimulatory APCs, augments intratumoral T cell responses, and inhibits tumor progression.
We next asked whether reduced growth of DKO tumors reflects tumor cell autonomous effects or anti-tumor immune responses. DKO cells did not demonstrate a significant proliferation defect in vitro ( Figure S5 H). Depletion of either CD4 + or CD8 + T cells allowed for rapid growth of DKO tumors in vivo , demonstrating a role of T cells ( Figure 5 E). Additionally, DKO tumors grew significantly faster in Batf3 KO mice (deficient in cDC1s) compared to WT controls, suggesting that anti-tumor immune responses upon RA reduction required the presence of cDC1s that cross-present tumor antigens to prime CD8 + T cells ( Figures 5 F and S5 I).
Next, we examined the tumor-specificity of T cell responses induced by RA-deficiency by expressing the model antigen ovalbumin (OVA) in Cas9 control and DKO FS cells. We found a higher frequency and number of OVA (hence tumor)-specific splenic CD8 + T cells in mice harboring DKO-OVA tumors ( Figure 5 G). Consistent with published data, parental (control) FS were poorly responsive to αPD1 monotherapy ( Figure 5 H) ( Gubin et al., 2018 20. Gubin, M.M. ∙ Esaulova, E. ∙ Ward, J.P. ... High-Dimensional Analysis Delineates Myeloid and Lymphoid Compartment Remodeling during Successful Immune-Checkpoint Cancer Therapy Cell. 2018; 175 :1014-1030 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (256) PubMed Google Scholar ). Strikingly, administration of αPD1 in established DKO tumors lead to significant tumor regression ( Figures 5 H and 5I). Mice that experienced complete regression of DKO tumors rejected re-challenge with parental FS but not unrelated tumor cells ( Figure 5 J). Finally, reducing RA levels in the primary tumor (Raldh1/3 DKO) enhanced the sensitivity to αPD-1 in a distant (contralateral) Cas9 Control tumor, providing additional evidence of enhanced anti-tumor T cell immunity upon tumor RA reduction ( Figures 5 K–5M). Together, these results show that reducing tumor RA production engenders a strong anti-tumor T cell response that synergizes with checkpoint blockade to control murine sarcoma.
Although pharmacologic approaches to specifically inhibit Raldh enzymes are not available, potent antagonists of RAR signaling exist ( Chiba et al., 2016 11. Chiba, T. ∙ Skrypnyk, N.I. ∙ Skvarca, L.B. ... Retinoic Acid Signaling Coordinates Macrophage-Dependent Injury and Repair after AKI J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2016; 27 :495-508 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ). We first asked whether RAR signaling blockade could recapitulate the aforementioned effects of reducing tumor RA production. As RAR antagonism has pleiotropic effects on myelopoesis and peripheral immunity, we restricted RA-signaling blockade to the TME via intratumoral administration of BMS493. The results were similar to those observed in RA-deficient DKO tumors, including decreased frequency of TAMs, increased activation markers on APCs, and increased frequency of T cells ( Figures 6 A–6C). Strikingly, intratumoral BMS493 robustly synergized with systemic αPD1 therapy in FS ( Figures 6 D and S6 A). Of interest, Raldh1 and Raldh3 were significantly upregulated in tumors treated with BMS493, suggesting a potential resistance mechanism whereby tumors upregulate RA production in response to RA signaling blockade ( Figure S6 B). However, administration of BMS493 to DKO tumors (in which this resistance mechanism cannot operate) did not show superior response compared to control, suggesting the existence of other resistance mechanisms ( Figure S6 C).
We also tested intratumoral RAR inhibition on transplanted UPS cells, finding similar synergy between RAR blockade and αPD1 therapy ( Figures 6 E and S6 D). In contrast to our findings in FS and UPS, RAR blockade with or without αPD1 did not show any effect in B16-F10 melanoma, a tumor where we found little to no RA production ( Figures 6 F and S6 E). The aforementioned effects of RAR signaling inhibitors raise exciting translational possibilities in RA-rich tumors but were shown in syngeneic transplant-based systems with intratumoral injections. Hence, we tested the effects of systemic delivery (intraperitoneal) of BMS493 in autochthonous mouse models of SS and UPS. Similar to transplantation-based models, BMS493 increased stimulatory myeloid cells and T cells within both types of tumors ( Figures 6 G, 6H, S6 F, and S6G).
Thus far, we show that reducing RA in TME promotes monocyte differentiation into immunostimulatory APCs and enhances anti-tumor T cell responses. To further examine the link between these two observations, we devised a monocyte-transplant experiment whereby bone marrow monocytes from LysM Cre : Rosa26 tdT mice were treated ex vivo with DMSO (control) or BMS493 (irreversible RAR blockade), washed, and transplanted into syngeneic FS tumors. The fate of the transplanted monocytes and their impact on tumor growth were monitored. In contrast to control monocytes, a significant fraction of BMS493-treated monocytes differentiated into CD11c + MHCII + DCs in the TME ( Figure 6 I). Concomitantly, tumors transplanted with BMS493-treated monocytes grew at a significantly slower rate and displayed an immunostimulatory TME with evidence of activated APCs and T cells ( Figures 6 J and 6K).
Taken together, these findings provide proof-of-concept for targeting RA-RAR signaling in solid tumor immunotherapy.
RA producing enzymes are known to be elevated in many human cancers (including breast, lung, colon, prostate) and have been associated with poor treatment response and worse survival ( Khoury et al., 2012; Li et al., 2010, 2014; Marcato et al., 2015; Wei et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2013 29.

Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling identifies ALDH1A3 promoter methylation as a prognostic predictor in G-CIMP- primary glioblastoma Cancer Lett. 2013; 328 :120-125 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that human UPS expressed higher levels of RALDH3 compared to non-malignant skeletal muscle ( Figure 7 A). Consistent with murine UPS, ALDEFLUOR analysis of human UPS showed that a subset of CD45 − cells produced the majority of RA ( Figure 7 B). CD45 − cells of human SS also expressed significantly higher levels of RALDH2 and RALDH3 compared to CD45 + cells ( Figure 7 C). Further, analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) mRNA data revealed that RALDH isoforms are expressed in many types of cancers with RALDH1 and RALDH3 generally being more highly expressed than RALDH2 ( Figure S7 A). Expression of RALDH1 or RALDH3 was negatively correlated with survival in multiple types of human cancer ( Figure S7 B). In sarcoma, subcategorization by Raldh expression was not predictive of poor clinical outcome, but interpretation of these analyses is significantly hampered by small sample sizes and heterogeneity in sarcoma clinical datasets and will require additional investigation ( Figure S7 C).
To identify human tumors where high levels of RA may drive myeloid mediated immunosuppression, we generated an unbiased list of RA-regulated genes from our microarray-based RA-treated human monocyte gene expression profile ( Figure S7 D). We queried for the expression of these genes in the TCGA mRNA database and determined an “RA response score” for individual tumor samples. In TCGA sarcoma dataset, we found that the RA score clustered uniquely within certain sarcoma subtypes, with DDLPS, UPS, and MFS having higher average RA scores compared to STLMS, ULMS, and SS ( Figures 7 D and 7E). The RA score was significantly predictive of survival in ULMS ( Figure S7 E). Further, the RA score (compared to a “random score”) was enriched in a group of samples across all cancer types in TCGA, suggesting that a subset of human tumors may experience heightened RA signaling ( Figure S7 F). The RA score was significantly correlated with RALDH3 expression, providing transcriptional evidence that this score is likely reflective of higher tumor RA ( Figure 7 F). Notably, the RA score was significantly correlated with multiple members of transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) and IL-10 signaling pathways, which are known to drive immunosuppression in cancer ( Figure 7 F). This correlation was not restricted to sarcoma and included several common tumor types ( Figure 7 F). Hence, similar to murine sarcomas, RA may drive immunosuppression in many distinct human solid tumors.
In summary, our study identifies an RA-dependent immune evasion pathway in solid tumors, provides proof of concept for targeting this pathway for solid tumor immunotherapy, and describes a method to potentially identify human tumors in which this pathway is active and hence amenable to RA-targeted therapeutic approaches.

Section: Discussion

The immunosuppressive TME prevents spontaneous and treatment-induced anti-tumor immune responses. Myeloid cells are key drivers of immunosuppression and the molecular basis of immunosuppressive myeloid cell function in TME has begun to be elucidated. Some examples include PI3Kγ signaling driving anti-inflammatory function of TAMs, lipid accumulation driving tumor DC dysfunction, and prostaglandin E2 driving suppressive neutrophil functions ( Cubillos-Ruiz et al., 2015; Kaneda et al., 2016; Veglia et al., 2019 12. Cubillos-Ruiz, J.R. ∙ Silberman, P.C. ∙ Rutkowski, M.R. ... ER Stress Sensor XBP1 Controls Anti-tumor Immunity by Disrupting Dendritic Cell Homeostasis Cell. 2015; 161 :1527-1538 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (626) PubMed Google Scholar 28. Kaneda, M.M. ∙ Messer, K.S. ∙ Ralainirina, N. ... PI3Kγ is a molecular switch that controls immune suppression Nature. 2016; 539 :437-442 Crossref Scopus (838) PubMed Google Scholar 54. Veglia, F. ∙ Tyurin, V.A. ∙ Blasi, M. ... Fatty acid transport protein 2 reprograms neutrophils in cancer Nature. 2019; 569 :73-78 Crossref Scopus (424) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, we describe an RA-dependent mechanism affecting myeloid differentiation that promotes an immunosuppressive TME and tumor immune escape. Previous work has demonstrated the importance of Mafb and Irf4 in controlling monocyte fate commitment into macrophages and DCs, respectively ( Goudot et al., 2017 19. Goudot, C. ∙ Coillard, A. ∙ Villani, A.-C. ... Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Controls Monocyte Differentiation into Dendritic Cells versus Macrophages Immunity. 2017; 47 :582-596 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (243) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our work suggests that tumors target this transcriptional circuitry to increase TAMs and reduce DCs. Hence, repolarizing the immune TME from a suppressive to stimulatory milieu may benefit from targeting both dysfunction and differentiation of myeloid cells in the TME.
RA is a well-studied signaling molecule and a powerful morphogen with important roles in the development and function of various cells. Solid tumors represent a complex niche comprising of many different cell types besides malignant cells. Hence, the overall impact of RA signaling on solid tumors is likely a sum total of its effects on the constituent cells of the TME. RA has been shown to have “pro-differentiation” effects on several types of tumor cells and hence can be considered anti-tumor in this context. Indeed, this has been the dominant theme in the field of RA cancer research. In contrast, we show here that RA drives anti-inflammatory effects in immune cells and can be considered pro-tumor in this context. Therefore, targeting RA signaling for tumor therapy requires a clear understanding of its role in specific tumor types as well as selective targeting of the appropriate cell type within TME. We have attempted to identify tumor types where the RA-dependent myeloid pathway may play a role in immune evasion by computing a monocyte “RA response score.” The overarching intent is to identify appropriate patient populations for potential clinical trials based on RA-targeting for tumor immunotherapy.
DCs can originate from HSC-derived DC precursors (cDCs) or from monocytes (moDCs). In this study, we primarily focused on the effects of RA on moDCs, given that monocytes are vastly more abundant than cDC precursors and continuously infiltrate solid tumors. Nonetheless, previous studies have examined the role of RA on splenic and intestinal cDC development, finding that RA can actually promote the development of cDC2s ( Klebanoff et al., 2013 31. Klebanoff, C.A. ∙ Spencer, S.P. ∙ Torabi-Parizi, P. ... Retinoic acid controls the homeostasis of pre-cDC-derived splenic and intestinal dendritic cells J. Exp. Med. 2013; 210 :1961-1976 Crossref Scopus (106) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although outside the scope of the current manuscript, we also observed that RA did not suppress cDC development in FLT3 culture systems, in contrast to its effects on moDC development (not shown). This suggests that the effects of RA on DCs may depend on ontogeny.
Previous studies have shown links between Th2 cytokine milieu and immunosuppressive TME, although the underlying pathways are not fully understood ( Fridman et al., 2012; McCormick and Heller, 2015; Suzuki et al., 2015; Zou, 2005 17. Fridman, W.H. ∙ Pagès, F. ∙ Sautès-Fridman, C. ... The immune contexture in human tumours: impact on clinical outcome Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2012; 12 :298-306 Crossref Scopus (3650) PubMed Google Scholar 38. McCormick, S.M. ∙ Heller, N.M. Commentary: IL-4 and IL-13 receptors and signaling Cytokine. 2015; 75 :38-50 Crossref Scopus (228) PubMed Google Scholar 50. Suzuki, A. ∙ Leland, P. ∙ Joshi, B.H. ... Targeting of IL-4 and IL-13 receptors for cancer therapy Cytokine. 2015; 75 :79-88 Crossref Scopus (171) PubMed Google Scholar 58. Zou, W. Immunosuppressive networks in the tumour environment and their therapeutic relevance Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5 :263-274 Crossref Scopus (1804) PubMed Google Scholar ). RA induction by IL-13 described here provides one mechanistic basis for this observation. Notably, both IL-4 and IL-13 play a role in the differentiation of monocytes into DCs and M2-polarized macrophages. Induction of RA via these cytokines blocks DC differentiation while allowing M2 macrophages to develop from monocytes, representing an interesting pathway by which tumor cells sense and respond to “immune pressure.” However, additional factors likely regulate RA production in solid tumors. It is also unclear whether tumor cells are the only RA-producing cells within the TME of all tumor types. Given the pro-differentiation effects of RA, other non-malignant cells of TME, such as fibroblasts, may be the primary source of RA in some tumors. We anticipate future work to clarify these issues, which will help develop RA-targeted approaches for tumor immunotherapy.

All animal procedures were conducted according to National Institutes of Health guidelines and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Pennsylvania.
C57BL/6 syngeneic fibrosarcoma cell line was a generous gift from Dr. Robert Schrieber at Washington University in St. Louis and was used for experimentation as previously described ( Gubin et al., 2018 20. Gubin, M.M. ∙ Esaulova, E. ∙ Ward, J.P. ... High-Dimensional Analysis Delineates Myeloid and Lymphoid Compartment Remodeling during Successful Immune-Checkpoint Cancer Therapy Cell. 2018; 175 :1014-1030 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (256) PubMed Google Scholar ). Kras G12D : Trp53 flox sarcoma cell line was a generous gift from Dr. Sandra Ryeom and B16-F10 melanoma cell line was a generous gift from Dr. Andy Minn. Tumor cell lines were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS, 1% Pen/Strep and 2mM glutamine. Low passage (< P15) cell lines were used for in vitro and in vivo experimentation. All cells were confirmed to be negative for mycoplasma contamination as assessed by MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Lonza).
Human undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, synovial sarcoma, or non-malignant muscle samples were obtained from surgically resected tumors from patients (de-identified) undergoing therapeutic surgical resection in accordance with protocol approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Pennsylvania. Single cell suspensions from human tumor samples were generated using methods described in sections below. Similarly, ALDEFLUOR assay, cell sorting and qPCR analyses were performed as described below.
We performed differential expression analysis, using DESeq2, on microarray data of human monocytes treated with RA or DMSO. Genes up or downregulated by at least three-fold (with false discovery rate q-value < 0.05) were collected and assigned to the RA response gene signature that contained a total of 146 genes. For analysis of TCGA mRNA datasets, only genes that were expressed with a FPKM value > 0.5 across all patient samples in a cancer group were retained. This reduced the total number of genes in the RA response gene signature to n = 132 for the SARC, BRCA, LUAD, and COAD datasets.
From the TCGA mRNA expression data, we computed the FPKM z-score for the n = 132 RA response signature genes and hierarchically ranked them as shown in Figure 7 D. The RA response score for every patient sample, in a given cancer, for a given gene set, was taken to be the z-score summed over all genes. In order to evaluate the heterogeneity in the RA response score, we also computed a random response score employing a randomly generated gene set (n = 132 genes) as described above. To identify the genes in a specific cancer that may be regulated by the RA response score, we performed a genome-wide correlation between the patient RA response score and the corresponding FPKM values and quantified the degree of correlation using a linear regression model.
Additionally, Kaplan-Meier analyses based Raldh mRNA substratification in selected TCGA datasets was performed using UALCAN ( Chandrashekar et al., 2017 9. Chandrashekar, D.S. ∙ Bashel, B. ∙ Balasubramanya, S.A.H. ... UALCAN: A Portal for Facilitating Tumor Subgroup Gene Expression and Survival Analyses Neoplasia. 2017; 19 :649-658 Crossref Scopus (3959) PubMed Google Scholar ). High expression indicates the top quartile, while low expression indicates the bottom quartile.
Microarray services were provided by the UPENN Molecular Profiling Facility, including quality control tests of the total RNA samples by agilent bioanalyzer and nanodrop spectrophotometry. All protocols were conducted as described in the Affymetrix WT Pico Reagent Kit Manual and the Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual. Gene expression data were normalized and values modeled using ArrayStar4 (DNASTAR). The data is available for download at the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) through accession number GSE144612 (reference series for all microarray experiments associated with this manuscript).
Cultured tumor cells were detached using 0.05% trypsin (GIBCO), washed once with DMEM media and once with 1x PBS, and counted in preparation for implantation. Tumor cells were propagated in vitro for two passages prior to implantation and injected cells were greater than 90% viable. 1 × 10 6 tumor cells were implanted subcutaneously (s.c.) into shaved flanks of recipient mice. Tumor dimensions were measured using a caliper starting at Day 7 and every three days thereafter; volume was calculated by using formula (ab 2 )π/2, where a is the longest measurement and b is the shortest. Tumor volumes of 1000mm 3 were used as endpoints for survival analyses. Waterfall plots were generated by comparing tumor volume at the start of treatment to tumor volume 11d later. For re-challenge experiments with tumor cell lines, tumor cells were injected into mice cured of primary tumors for > 60 days.
Tumors were harvested and minced at indicated time points post-implantation for analysis. Single cell suspensions were generated by digestion with collagenase B and DNase I for 45 minutes at 37°C and filtration through 70uM cell strainer. Mouse blood was collected in EDTA tubes and RBCs were lysed using ACK lysing buffer. Samples were incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature with anti-mouse CD16/32 Fc Block, and subsequently stained on ice with primary-fluorophore conjugated antibodies for identification of cell populations by FACS. 7AAD (BioLegend) was used for dead cell discrimination. Flow cytometry was performed on an LSR II Flow Cytometer (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using FlowJo software (Treestar). List of antibodies can be found in table above.
Single cell suspensions generated from mouse tumors were incubated for 4 hours at 37°C with PMA (50ng/mL; Sigma), Ionomycin (750ng/mL; Sigma) and GolgiStop (5ug/mL; BD). Intracellular staining was performed using a fixation/permeabilization kit (eBiosciences) according to manufacturer’s instructions.
After tumor cells were propagated for two weeks in vitro , 5 × 10 4 of indicated tumor cell lines were plated in triplicate. Viable and non-viable cell numbers were counted each day for five days.
The ALDEFLUOR assay (STEMCELL Technologies) was performed according to manufacturer’s instructions to identify cells with Aldh activity. In brief, single cell suspensions generated from indicated tumors were incubated with a fluorescently tagged substrate of the Aldh enzyme; the fluorescent product accumulates in cells proportional to their Aldh activity. DEAB, a potent inhibitor of Aldh, was used as a negative control for each sample. Cells were subsequently stained with surface antibodies and fluorescence was quantified by flow cytometry. Gates for Aldh+ cells were drawn relative to baseline fluorescence as determined by DEAB negative control. To avoid spectral overlap, ALDERED assay (STEMCELL Technologies) was performed in lieu of ALDEFLUOR assay for samples with endogenous GFP fluorescence.
Cells were sorted on MoFlo Astrios or FACS Jazz at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) Flow Cytometry Core Laboratory. For measurement of gene expression in sorted cells, RNA was isolated from sorted cell pellets and qPCR performed as described elsewhere. For T cell suppression assays, tumor APCs were sorted into complete RPMI media and T cell suppression assay performed as described elsewhere.
All -trans retinoic acid was extracted from snap frozen mouse tumors or normal muscle as described ( Kane et al., 2008 27. Kane, M.A. ∙ Folias, A.E. ∙ Wang, C. ... Quantitative profiling of endogenous retinoic acid in vivo and in vitro by tandem mass spectrometry Anal. Chem. 2008; 80 :1702-1708 Crossref Scopus (197) PubMed Google Scholar ). Quantification of ATRA was performed by the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia Metabolomics Core using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS).
Monocytes were isolated from bone marrow of indicated mice using the Mouse BM Monocyte Isolation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Viability and purity of negative selection monocyte isolation was assessed by flow cytometry to be > 90%.
Monocytes were isolated (as described above) from mouse bone marrow of LysM Cre : Rosa26 tdT : Zbtb46 GFP mice. Subsequently, 5 × 10 5 monocytes were resuspended in 50uL 1x PBS and injected directly into established FS flank tumors at 7 days post implantation. Tumors were harvested at specified time points and analyzed by flow cytometry to track tdT + monocytic progeny.
Mouse monocytes (isolated from bone marrow or sorted from LysM Cre : Rosa26 tdT : Zbtb46 GFP tumors) were cultured with GM-CSF (20ng/mL) & IL-4 (20ng/mL), GM-CSF & IL-13 (20ng/mL), GM-CSF alone, or M-CSF alone (20ng/mL). Normal donor human monocytes (obtained the Human Immunology Core at the University of Pennsylvania were cultured with GM-CSF (50ng/mL) & IL-4 (50ng/mL), or M-CSF (50ng/mL). Murine or human cytokines were purchased from PeproTech. RA (100nM for mouse and 20nM for human monocytes) or DMSO was added at specified time points for indicated differentiation assays. Cellular identity and function of differentiated monocytes was assessed by a combination of unbiased transcriptional analyses, flow cytometry based protein analyses, and functional T cell suppression assays.
Mouse splenic T cells were isolated from a non-tumor bearing C57BL/6 mouse using Pan T Cell Isolation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec). Viability and purity of negative selection T cell isolation was assessed by flow cytometry to be > 95%. Normal donor human T cells were obtained from the Human Immunology Core at the University of Pennsylvania. 8 × 10 4 mouse or human T cells were labeled with CFSE and cultured for 3 days at 37°C with 2uL of αCD3/28 beads (Dynabeads Mouse or Human T-Activator CD3/28, GIBCO) along with 30U recombinant human IL-2. Mononuclear phagocytes generated under various in vitro differentiation conditions (or sorted from mouse tumors) were co-cultured with stimulated T cells. T cell proliferation and activation was measured by flow cytometry to quantify mononuclear phagocyte suppressive ability.
200ug of clone GK1.5 (CD4 + T cell depletion), clone 2.43 (CD8 + T cell depletion), or clone LTF-2 (isotype control) antibody was administered i.p. starting three days prior to tumor implantation and repeated every three days until mouse sacrifice. All antibodies were purchased from BioXCell. CD4 + and CD8 + depletion was confirmed in peripheral blood and within tumors by flow cytometry.
200ug of αPD1 monoclonal blocking antibody (clone RMP 1-14, BioXCell) or isotype control antibody (clone 2A3, BioXCell) was administered i.p. at Days 7, 10 and 13 post tumor implantation. 200ug of BMS493 (Torcis) was administered intratumorally at Days 7, 10 and 13 post tumor implantation. BMS493 was dissolved in 10uL DMSO and diluted to a final volume of 50uL in 1x PBS for intratumoral injection. As a vehicle control, 10uL DMSO in a final volume of 50uL was injected intratumorally.
Total RNA was isolated using GenElute Mammalian Total RNA Miniprep Kit (Sigma). Reverse transcription was performed using High Capacity RNA to cDNA Kit (Life Technologies). qRT-PCR was performed using ViiA7 Real-Time PCR machine and TaqMan probes used for gene specific amplification (purchased from ThermoFisher Scientific) are listed below.

LentiCRISPRv2 vector was a gift from Feng Zhang (Addgene plasmid #52961). In brief, the vector was transfected into 293T cells using polyethylenimine (PEI) along with lentivirus packaging plasmids. Lentivirus supernatant was collected 48 hours later and passed through a 40uM filter. Subsequently, tumor cells were transduced and selected on 3ug/mL of puromycin for two weeks. Clones were generated using single cell sorting and knockout efficiency determined by genomic sequencing and gene-specific qPCR analysis. CRISPR sequences were identified using mouse Geckov2 library (Feng Zhang): Raldh1 : TAA-ATC-CGA-CAA-GTA-TGC-AT; Raldh3 : TAC-TTA-CAG-CCA-GGA-TCG-CT; IL13Ra1 : GAG-ACG-CTC-AAA-TTC-GTC-AC. In vivo knockout efficiency of Raldh1/3 DKO cell line was determined by qPCR for Raldh1 and Raldh3 gene expression in bulk tumor tissue, by ALDEFLUOR assay measuring functional enzymatic activity on tumor single cell suspension, and by liquid chromatography / mass spectrometry for all -trans retinoic acid in tumor tissue.
Raldh2 -GFP ORF expression clone was purchased from GeneCopoeia and transfected into Cas9 Control or Raldh1/3 DKO FS cell lines using electroporation and nucleofection (Amaxa Nucleofector II, Lonza). After three days, cell lines were sorted based on GFP expression using a BD FACS Jazz instrument and subsequently cultured for two weeks in vitro prior to s.c. implantation. In vivo confirmation of overexpression was determined by qPCR for Raldh2 and maintenance of GFP expression in bulk tumor tissue.
OVA-encoding plasmid was a kind gift from Dr. Robert Vonderheide at UPenn. Raldh1/3 DKO or Cas9 Control FS tumor cell lines were transfected with plasmid encoding cytoplasmic OVA-ZsGreen. 3d later, cells were FACsorted for ZsGreen to ensure equal expression of OVA-ZsGreen between cell lines.
Cas9 Control or Raldh1/3 DKO tumors (n = 4 per group) were harvested on Day 11 (as described elsewhere) and CD45+ live cells were FACS sorted. Subsequently, 10x Genomics Controller and the v3 Library and Gel Bead kit (10x Genomics) were used to obtain single-cell emulsions. 10x 3′ v3 kit protocol was followed as described to generate RNA sequencing libraries. The generated libraries were sequenced using an Illumina NovaSeq SP. The data are available for download at the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) through accession number GSE144507 .
Downstream analysis of the single-cell RNA-sequenced samples was performed using Seurat (v. 3.1.0) in R (v. 3.6.0). Genes expressed in less than three cells were removed. Cells that expressed less than 500 genes or had over 14% mitochondrial content were filtered out. The four samples were merged and counts for all genes were log2 normalized and scaled ( NormalizeData and ScaleData ). Principal components (PCs) were determined using the 2000 most variable genes ( FindVariableFeatures ). Subsequently, the top 50 PCs were used for graph-based cluster identification and dimensionality reduction by t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE). Myeloid clusters were subsetted out using Adgre1, Lyz2, S100a9, Itgax and negative for lymphoid markers and re-analyzed as described above. Genes separating TAM_1 and TAM_2 clusters were determined using the default Wilcoxon Rank Sum test in the FindMarkers function.
Statistical significance was calculated between two groups by student’s unpaired t test. One-way ANOVA with Tukey’s HSD post-test was used to calculate statistical significance between multiple groups. Significance for survival was calculated by Kaplan-Meier with long-rank analysis. Analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 8. Error bars represent SEM and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant ( ∗ p < 0.05, ∗∗ p < 0.01, ∗∗∗ p < 0.001).
The datasets generated in this study are available for download at the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) through accession numbers GSE144612 (microarray dataset) and GSE144507 (scRNaseq dataset).
