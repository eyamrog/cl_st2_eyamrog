Title: Spatially confined sub-tumor microenvironments in pancreatic cancer


Abstract: Summary

Intratumoral heterogeneity is a critical frontier in understanding how the tumor microenvironment (TME) propels malignant progression. Here, we deconvolute the human pancreatic TME through large-scale integration of histology-guided regional multiOMICs with clinical data and patient-derived preclinical models. We discover “subTMEs,” histologically definable tissue states anchored in fibroblast plasticity, with regional relationships to tumor immunity, subtypes, differentiation, and treatment response. “Reactive” subTMEs rich in complex but functionally coordinated fibroblast communities were immune hot and inhabited by aggressive tumor cell phenotypes. The matrix-rich “deserted” subTMEs harbored fewer activated fibroblasts and tumor-suppressive features yet were markedly chemoprotective and enriched upon chemotherapy. SubTMEs originated in fibroblast differentiation trajectories, and transitory states were notable both in single-cell transcriptomics and in situ . The intratumoral co-occurrence of subTMEs produced patient-specific phenotypic and computationally predictable heterogeneity tightly linked to malignant biology. Therefore, heterogeneity within the plentiful, notorious pancreatic TME is not random but marks fundamental tissue organizational units.

Section: Introduction

The importance of the tumor microenvironment (TME) for malignant progression is well recognized across cancer types ( Altorki et al., 2019 1. Altorki, N.K. ∙ Markowitz, G.J. ∙ Gao, D. ...

Oncol. 2020; 17 :527-540 Crossref Scopus (632) PubMed Google Scholar ). Yet, the relevant net variations in this complex entity and their precise functions in different disease trajectories are still poorly understood. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), a devastating malignancy with particularly sparse therapeutic options ( Rahib et al., 2016 41. Rahib, L. ∙ Fleshman, J.M. ∙ Matrisian, L.M. ... Evaluation of Pancreatic Cancer Clinical Trials and Benchmarks for Clinically Meaningful Future Trials: A Systematic Review JAMA Oncol. 2016; 2 :1209-1216 Crossref Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ), exhibits a famously substantial and intensely studied TME. This ecosystem of immune cells, endothelial cells, and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) provides specialized niches for cancer cells and modulates tumor growth and invasive behavior ( Ho et al., 2020 24. Ho, W.J. ∙ Jaffee, E.M. ∙ Zheng, L. The tumour microenvironment in pancreatic cancer - clinical challenges and opportunities Nat. Rev. Clin. Oncol. 2020; 17 :527-540 Crossref Scopus (632) PubMed Google Scholar ). Still, discrepancies remain on how to annotate relevant stromal elements and their respective pro- or anti-tumor functions. For example, recent work revealed clinically relevant subtypes of PDAC stroma ( Maurer et al., 2019 31. Maurer, C. ∙ Holmstrom, S.R. ∙ He, J. ...

Yet, tissue-based studies suggest that collagen- and ECM-rich stroma yields a better prognosis ( Bolm et al., 2017 6. Bolm, L. ∙ Cigolla, S. ∙ Wittel, U.A. ...

Similarly, despite the wealth of functional studies showing that CAFs can promote PDAC progression and chemoresistance ( Ligorio et al., 2019 30. Ligorio, M. ∙ Sil, S. ∙ Malagon-Lopez, J. ...

Stromal elements act to restrain, rather than support, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma Cancer Cell. 2014; 25 :735-747 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1576) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, tumor/TME-interactions are not uniformly tumor promoting or inhibitory and the underlying intricate nuances remain elusive.
Recent landmark studies reveal a remarkable cellular complexity of the TME, comprising numerous stromal cell subpopulations, especially in the PDAC CAF compartment ( Dominguez et al., 2020 16. Dominguez, C.X. ∙ Müller, S. ∙ Keerthivasan, S. ...

Cross-Species Single-Cell Analysis of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Reveals Antigen-Presenting Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts Cancer Discov. 2019; 9 :1102-1123 Crossref Scopus (1104) PubMed Google Scholar ). We are also learning that PDAC displays a unique immune milieu with heterogenous immunosuppressive populations suspected to hamper current immunotherapeutic strategies ( Fan et al., 2020 19. Fan, J.Q. ∙ Wang, M.-F. ∙ Chen, H.-L. ... Current advances and outlooks in immunotherapy for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma Mol. Cancer. 2020; 19 :32 Crossref Scopus (127) PubMed Google Scholar ). These complex cellular communities and their involved interactions encompass a myriad of possibilities for how they could be sustaining growth and progression of the malignant epithelium. A major obstacle for assigning clear functions to the TME, especially in PDAC, lies in its intratumoral heterogeneity ( Iacobuzio-Donahue et al., 2020 25. Iacobuzio-Donahue, C.A. ∙ Litchfield, K. ∙ Swanton, C. Intratumor heterogeneity reflects clinical disease course Nat. Can. 2020; 1 :3-6 Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar ; Vickman et al., 2020 51. Vickman, R.E. ∙ Faget, D.V. ∙ Beachy, P. ... Deconstructing tumor heterogeneity: the stromal perspective Oncotarget. 2020; 11 :3621-3632 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), which has implications for bulk analyses and sampling but also suggests the presence of distinct and possibly independent regional programs in this TME. Given that histology is reflective of how cell communities in a tissue self-organize to establish their function, we hypothesized that recurrent phenotypes within the heterogenous TME could signify stromal “functional units” relevant for tumor pathobiology.

Section: Results

We aimed to find regional histological patterns in the PDAC TME that recurred across patients, stages, and sites. Regional TME heterogeneity was largely due to variations in ratios of cellular to acellular components, maturation and extent of ECM, and stromal cell morphology ( Figure 1 A). Anchored on these histological features, we reviewed 143 treatment-naive resections and pre-treatment biopsies from 210 advanced cases ( Figure 1 B; Table S1 ; STAR Methods ) and identified three recurrent TME phenotypes in PDAC ( Figure 1 C): (1) “deserted” regions with thin, spindle-shaped fibroblasts, loose matured fibers, and often keloid or myxoid features, (2) “reactive” regions containing plump fibroblasts with enlarged nuclei, few acellular components, often rich in inflammatory infiltrate, (3) regions with intermediate levels of these features. These deserted, intermediate, and reactive TME phenotypes were also seen in other common metastatic sites ( Figure 1 D). Assessment of the main TME phenotype (>50% area contribution; Figure S1 A) revealed their pervasiveness across PDAC stages ( Figure 1 E) and cohorts (TCGA PAAD; Figure 1 F).
Noticeably, these TME phenotypes could co-occur within the same tumor in a spatially confined manner ( Figure 1 G), which led us to name them “sub-tumor microenvironments” (subTMEs). This phenomenon was frequent: subTMEs co-occurred in 76/143 resections (53%; Figure 1 H; Figure S1 B) and 111/159 TCGA PAAD cases (70%; Figure 1 I), irrespective of the main subTME in the tumor ( Figures 1 H and 1I). Importantly, patient survival was not linked to main TME phenotypes ( Figure 1 J; Figure S1 C) but to intratumoral subTME co-occurrence ( Figure 1 K), i.e., a phenotypically heterogenous TME. This subTME co-occurrence remained a poor prognostic variable in multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analyses for both cohorts ( Figures S1 D and S1E). In sum, we categorized the human PDAC TME into distinct regional phenotypes termed subTMEs, which occurred across disease stages and sites and had a profound combinatory effect on patient survival.
To study the composition and function of subTMEs, we assembled a workflow for large-scale patient-matched integration of histopathology, clinical datasets, multidimensional profiling, and subTME-specific model systems. We first constructed subTME-specific multiOMIC profiles from 32 treatment-naive resections ( STAR Methods ; Figure 2 A). By laser capture microdissection (LCM), we separately extracted different subTMEs as well as tumor cells residing within ( Figure S2 A). Samples were split for parallel profiling by shotgun proteomics and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). This was successful for 29/32 patients; 3/32 cases yielded only enough material for proteome analysis. MultiOMIC profiling identified 5,708 unique protein groups ( Figure 2 B) and 17,945 transcripts ( Figure 2 C). Enrichment of TME and epithelial fractions by LCM was highly effective: tumor versus TME samples separated widely in principal-component analysis (PCA; Figure S2 B) due to highly distinct expression profiles with 5,050 protein DEGs (differentially expressed genes; p < 0.05 [Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted], false discovery rate <0.05) and 12,704 RNA DEGs ( Figure S2 C). These included known TME markers ACTA2/αSMA (proteome) and PDGFRA (transcriptome) in the top hits. We also observed near-complete alignment with well-validated stromal and epithelial RNA signatures ( Maurer et al., 2019 31. Maurer, C. ∙ Holmstrom, S.R. ∙ He, J. ... Experimental microdissection enables functional harmonisation of pancreatic cancer subtypes Gut. 2019; 68 :1034-1043 Crossref Scopus (123) PubMed Google Scholar ) in gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA; Figure S2 D).
We proceeded to interrogate the multiOMIC TME datasets. Remarkably, proteomes separated by subTME on the first principal component ( Figure 2 D) due to vast expression differences with 43% of stromal proteins differentially expressed between deserted and reactive subTMEs (1,222 DEGs in 2,822 TME proteins), indicating profound regional proteomic differences in the PDAC TME. SubTME transcriptomes showed similar but less pronounced grouping in PCA ( Figure 2 E) and relatively fewer DEGs (1,091 DEGs in 15,733 TME transcripts). The histologically intermediate subTME phenotype ( Figure 1 C) grouped in between reactive and deserted samples by proteome PCA ( Figure 2 D) showed intermediate differential expression ( Figure S2 E) and fewer DEGs compared to reactive subTMEs ( Figures S2 E and S2F). We concluded it likely represents a transitory state and collapsed intermediate and reactive OMICs profiles, and related validations, into one group for ease of data presentation. We then integrated the patient-matched proteomic and transcriptomic datasets to identify DEGs in deserted versus intermediate/reactive subTMEs. Among 5,475 genes detected at both RNA and protein levels, we found 1,194 protein DEGs ( Figure 2 F) and 358 RNA DEGs ( Figure 2 G). Due to the small number of RNA DEGs, the intersection was small (n = 108 DEGs), but expression changes were mostly reciprocated with 37 mutual downregulated genes, 58 mutual upregulated genes, and only 13 genes with discordant regulation ( Figure S2 G; Table S2 ). Notably, the subTME-specific 95 mutual RNA/protein DEGs comprised known players in tumor/stroma interaction (FBLN5, IGFBPs) and CAF subpopulation markers (ENG, LRRC15, DES, THBS4; Figure 2 H; Table S2 ).
To pinpoint biological functions unique to each subTME, we performed GSEA of the integrated normalized RNA and protein intensities ( Figure S2 G) against 8,350 gene sets from MSigDB and ConsensusPathDB. In line with their ECM-rich histological appearance ( Figure 1 C), deserted subTMEs exhibited strong enrichment of ECM, ECM-signaling, and humoral immunity pathways ( Figure 2 I; Table S3 ). Reactive subTMEs were enriched in gene sets related to cellular stress response (heat shock, hypoxia, growth, metabolic stress), growth factors with CAF-activating and immunomodulatory functions (e.g., fibroblast growth factor [FGF], transforming growth factor [TGF], platelet-derived growth factor [PDGF], Wnt), cytokines (interferons, tumor necrosis factor [TNF]), and cellular immunity (innate immunity, antigen presentation, TCR signaling; Figure 2 J, Table S4 ). Thus, highly distinct gene-expression profiles of human PDAC subTMEs, especially at the protein level, pointed to fundamental differences in their stromal effector function.
To dissect functional biology and cellular composition of subTMEs, we constructed a deep-phenotyping platform for human PDAC tissues ( Figure 3 A). Briefly, in a tissue microarray (TMA) from PDAC resections (n = 143), we histopathologically determined the subTME of each core (n = 596) before applying a 25-marker (immuno)histochemistry panel and second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy followed by digital quantification ( STAR Methods ). This enabled analysis of subTME composition both across patients and in patient-paired subTMEs ( Figure 3 A), with CK19-based estimation of TME and tumoral area aiding compartment-specific normalization ( Figure S3 A). SubTMEs differed strongly in composition: reactive/intermediate subTMEs had increased staining for markers of T cells (CD3), macrophages (CD68), endothelial cells (CD31), and CAFs (αSMA), while deserted subTMEs exhibited high collagen content and maturation and trended toward higher B cell marker (CD20) expression ( Figure 3 B), altogether highly concordant with annotation of their multiOMICs profiles ( Figures 2 I and 2J). This pattern ( Figure 3 B) was seen both globally across patients and, to a weaker extent, in both patient-paired reactive/deserted regions ( Figure 3 C) and bordering reactive/deserted regions ( Figure 3 D), illustrating a subTME-specific regional enrichment of major stromal components. Of note, the intermediate subTMEs exhibited intermediate levels of these stromal components ( Figure S3 B), in line with their intermediate histological appearance ( Figure 1 C) and gene-expression profiles ( Figures 2 D, S2 E, and S2F).
To define subTME-specific cell communities, we performed correlation analysis of stromal markers. Deserted subTMEs showed small, scattered immune clusters ( Figure 3 E). In contrast, reactive TMEs exhibited one uninterrupted cluster comprising all immune cell and immunity markers ( Figure 3 F). Since GSEA had already indicated prominent T cell-based immunity features in reactive subTMEs ( Figure 2 J), we queried common metrics of antitumor immunity. Reactive subTMEs had increased total CD8 + T cells ( Figure 3 G) and increased CD8 + and CD3 + cells in direct contact with a tumor cell ( Figure 3 H). Patient-matched tumor cell enriched whole-genome sequencing profiles (n = 104; Figure 3 A) showed higher SNV and neoantigen counts in tumors with a reactive-dominant TME ( Figure 3 I). Altogether, this indicated a regional hot, T cell inflamed immune phenotype in reactive subTMEs, further reflected in increased global genomic immunogenicity metrics of reactive-dominant tumors. Moreover, reactive regions had higher IDO-1 levels and trended to increased PD-L1 levels ( Figure 3 J), along with increased markers for suppressive immune cell types including FOXP3 (regulatory T cells), CD11b and CD15 (often expressed in MDSCs), and CD206 (M2 macrophages; Figure 3 K), suggesting a cell-based regulatory response typical for PDAC ( Fan et al., 2020 19. Fan, J.Q. ∙ Wang, M.-F. ∙ Chen, H.-L. ... Current advances and outlooks in immunotherapy for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma Mol. Cancer. 2020; 19 :32 Crossref Scopus (127) PubMed Google Scholar ; Steele et al., 2020 48. Steele, N.G. ∙ Carpenter, E.S. ∙ Kemp, S.B. ... Multimodal mapping of the tumor and peripheral blood immune landscape in human pancreatic cancer Nat. Can. 2020; 1 :1097-1112 Crossref Scopus (215) PubMed Google Scholar ). Intratumoral subTMEs thus differed widely in composition and represent distinct regional immune milieus.
Given their central role in stromal histological appearance and known immunomodulatory functions, we next queried the subTME CAF compartment. SubTME multiOMIC profiles differed in CAF markers ( Figure 4 A), such that different CAF subpopulations might preferentially localize to deserted or reactive regions. Yet, due to cellularity differences between subTMEs ( Figure 4 B), we could not definitively discriminate whether this stemmed from differential CAF numbers and/or differential per-cell expression levels. We thus extracted CAFs from 13 fresh PDAC specimens with histopathologically confirmed subTMEs ( Figure 4 C) for single-cell and functional characterization. Remarkably, growth patterns of subTME CAF monolayers closely recapitulated the characteristic histology of their originating subTMEs ( Figure 4 D). To test whether these distinct phenotypes were accompanied by behavioral differences, we focused on migration and proliferation, two disparate fibroblast functionalities ( De Donatis et al., 2010 14. De Donatis, A. ∙ Ranaldi, F. ∙ Cirri, P. Reciprocal control of cell proliferation and migration Cell Commun. Signal. 2010; 8 :20 Crossref Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar ). Reactive subTME CAF cultures were indeed more motile ( Figure 4 E), while deserted subTME CAF cultures grew faster ( Figure 4 F). Thus, human PDAC subTMEs harbored phenotypically and behaviorally distinct CAFs.
To query the presence of CAF subpopulations, we performed single-cell RNA-seq on 10 subTME in vitro CAF cultures. Out of 8,375 cells sequenced, 6,331 cells with a minimum of 200 genes detected per cell and <3% mitochondrial genes were carried into further analyses ( Figure S4 A). Cell assignment confirmed that all sequenced cells were CAFs ( Figure S4 B). In unsupervised graph-based clustering, the CAFs largely grouped by their originating subTME ( Figure 4 G) yet comprised a total of 11 individual clusters ( Figure 4 H). All 11 clusters were found in all 10 patients, albeit at varying levels ( Figure S4 C). Clusters 1/3/4/5 were enriched (>66%) in reactive subTME-derived CAFs, clusters 6/8/9 were enriched in deserted subTME-derived CAFs, and clusters 0/2/7/10 were shared at 33%–66% frequency ( Figure 4 I). Altogether, subTME CAF isolates contained numerous clusters, some of which were shared, and others subTME specific. We next analyzed whether these clusters represent known inflammatory CAF (iCAF) and myofibroblastic CAF (myCAF) subpopulations ( Elyada et al., 2019 17. Elyada, E. ∙ Bolisetty, M. ∙ Laise, P. ... Cross-Species Single-Cell Analysis of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Reveals Antigen-Presenting Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts Cancer Discov. 2019; 9 :1102-1123 Crossref Scopus (1104) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kieffer et al., 2020 26. Kieffer, Y. ∙ Hocine, H.R. ∙ Gentric, G. ... Single-Cell Analysis Reveals Fibroblast Clusters Linked to Immunotherapy Resistance in Cancer Cancer Discov. 2020; 10 :1330-1351 Crossref Scopus (432) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S4 D). Of the shared clusters, only cluster #0 aligned with myCAF signatures. Of the deserted-enriched clusters, #8 and #9 aligned with the pan-iCAF and #8 with the wound-myCAF signatures. Several iCAF and myCAF signatures were enriched throughout the reactive-type CAF clusters. Overall, the differences between deserted and reactive subTME CAFs did not appear to resemble known iCAF versus myCAF subpopulation differences.
We thus proceeded to functionally annotate each cluster through hypergeometric testing of DEGs ( Figure S4 E) against HALLMARK gene sets ( Liberzon et al., 2015 29. Liberzon, A. ∙ Birger, C. ∙ Thorvaldsdóttir, H. ... The Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) hallmark gene set collection Cell Syst. 2015; 1 :417-425 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (6393) PubMed Google Scholar ). Deserted clusters 6/9 were enriched in growth-related terms ( Figure 4 J), in line with an enrichment of G2M and S phase gene signatures ( Figure S4 F) and the increased growth rates of deserted-type CAF cultures ( Figure 4 F). The reactive subTME-derived CAFs exhibited broader functional molecular properties: inflammation-related gene sets (allograft rejection, interleukin [IL]-2-STAT5, IL-6-JAK-STAT, inflammatory response, interferons, TNF-α, complement) were thoroughly enriched across 3 of 4 reactive-type clusters ( Figure 4 J), suggesting that CAFs can contribute to the prominent inflammatory features of reactive subTMEs in tissues ( Figures 2 J and 3 C–3K). Furthermore, the EMT gene set was enriched across all reactive-type CAF clusters ( Figure 4 J), likely reflective of the increased motility of reactive subTME CAFs ( Figure 4 E). Likewise, myogenesis and TGF-β gene sets indicative of elevated CAF activation were enriched across reactive CAF clusters, as were apoptosis and vascularization-related terms ( Figure 4 J).
Since the multi-subpopulation CAF communities in deserted and reactive subTME cultures were unified in “coordinated states,” represented by cluster-overarching functional profiles ( Figure 4 J) and distinct morpho-histological ( Figure 4 D) and behavioral ( Figures 4 E and 4F) phenotypes, we investigated the presence of transitory states. We singled out intermediate subTME CAFs into a separate group again and inferred a differentiation trajectory through CytoTRACE ( Gulati et al., 2020 21. Gulati, G.S. ∙ Sikandar, S.S. ∙ Wesche, D.J. ... Single-cell transcriptional diversity is a hallmark of developmental potential Science. 2020; 367 :405-411 Crossref Scopus (457) PubMed Google Scholar ). This predicted an order of differentiation from deserted-type (less differentiated) to reactive-type CAFs (more differentiated) that indeed transitioned through the intermediate type ( Figure 4 K), much like the tissue level features of intermediate subTMEs ( Figures 2 D, S2 E, S2F, and S3 B). On this deserted-intermediate-reactive trajectory, the moving average of pluripotency markers (NT5E, ENO1, ITGB1, CD44, LGALS1, KIT) consistently decreased whereas CAF activation markers (FAPα, ACTA2/αSMA, S100A4), regulators (NNMT), and inflammatory phenotype markers (IL-6, IL-1B) increased ( Figure 4 L). Similarly, in tissues, CAF activation maker FAPα and inflammatory phenotype marker IL-6 increased from deserted to intermediate to reactive subTME regions ( Figure 4 M). Altogether, subTMEs appear to arise from overarching differentiation states of complex CAF communities with coordinated phenotypes, behavior, and function.
To investigate relationships between subTMEs and PDAC malignant behavior, we next queried the multiOMICs profiles of tumor epithelium extracted from reactive versus deserted subTMEs ( Figure 2 A). The individual profiles ( Figure S5 ) comprised 9 protein DEGs and 0 RNA DEGs. In contrast to the proteome-dominated differences in subTMEs ( Figures 2 F and 2G), the PDAC malignant epithelium exhibited comparable differential gene expression at the integrated RNA and protein levels ( Figure 5 A). In GSEA using HALLMARK gene sets, malignant epithelium from reactive subTMEs showed enrichment in cell-cycle progression (G2M phase, E2F targets), oncogenic signaling (MYC), and interferon response terms, while deserted-derived malignant epithelium was enriched in cellular metabolism (fatty acids, OxPhos), protein secretion, and drug metabolism terms ( Figure 5 B). We then validated these putative effects of subTME CAFs on PDAC biology in patient-derived organoids (PDOs), tissue imaging, and clinical datasets ( Figure 5 C).
As suggested by GSEA ( Figure 5 B), PDAC PDOs proliferated more in conditioned media from reactive-type CAFs ( Figure 5 D). Likewise, in tissues, tumor cells located within reactive subTMEs exhibited a higher proliferative index ( Figure 5 E). Thus, reactive subTMEs, and particularly the CAFs within these regions, can support tumor cell growth. Next, we followed up on the enrichment of the MYC gene set in reactive subTME-derived tumor cells ( Figure 5 B), since MYC activity is a central hub in the establishment of the aggressive squamous/basal PDAC subtype ( Bailey et al., 2016 3. Bailey, P. ∙ Chang, D.K. ∙ Nones, K. ..., Australian Pancreatic Cancer Genome Initiative Genomic analyses identify molecular subtypes of pancreatic cancer Nature. 2016; 531 :47-52 Crossref Scopus (2457) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hayashi et al., 2020 22. Hayashi, A. ∙ Fan, J. ∙ Chen, R. ... A unifying paradigm for transcriptional heterogeneity and squamous features in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma Nat. Can. 2020; 1 :59-74 Crossref Scopus (107) PubMed Google Scholar ). The basal-like gene signature ( Moffitt et al., 2015 35. Moffitt, R.A. ∙ Marayati, R. ∙ Flate, E.L. ... Virtual microdissection identifies distinct tumor- and stroma-specific subtypes of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma Nat. Genet. 2015; 47 :1168-1178 Crossref Scopus (1307) PubMed Google Scholar ) was enriched in malignant epithelium from reactive subTMEs ( Figure 5 F). Globally, squamous/basal-like cases had a lower frequency of deserted-dominant TMEs in PDAC resections (n = 98) and a higher frequency of reactive-dominant TMEs in stage III and IV cases (n = 200; Figure 5 G). Tumor cells located in reactive subTMEs had a more basal-like phenotype by differential expression of squamous marker CK5 and differentiation factor GATA6 ( Figure 5 H). Reactive and deserted subTMEs within a tumor were often accompanied by regional changes in tumor phenotypes; i.e., reactive subTMEs frequently harbored tumor cells with squamous features, solid sheets, or cribriform glands, while the adjacent deserted subTMEs harbored well-polarized glands ( Figure 5 I); correspondingly, tumor differentiation associated with the dominant TME phenotype ( Figure 5 J). Consequently, a reactive-dominant TME trended toward a shortened disease-free survival ( Figure 5 K) in early-stage resectable tumors with one main TME state ( Figure 1 K, gray strata). In sum, a deserted TME state appeared to support tumor differentiation, while a reactive state promoted tumor progression through proliferative, de-differentiated, squamous/basal-like tumor cell phenotypes.
Given the suspected key role of stroma in hampering PDAC treatment ( Liang et al., 2017 28. Liang, C. ∙ Shi, S. ∙ Meng, Q. ... Complex roles of the stroma in the intrinsic resistance to gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer: where we are and where we are going Exp. Mol. Med. 2017; 49 :e406 Crossref Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar ), we investigated effects of subTMEs on chemoresistance. Conditioned media (CM) from deserted-type CAFs increased Gemcitabine resistance in 4 out of 5 PDAC PDOs ( Figure 6 A), compared to CM from reactive CAFs. Furthermore, in patients from the COMPASS trial ( O’Kane et al., 2020 37. O’Kane, G.M. ∙ Grünwald, B.T. ∙ Jang, G.-H. ... GATA6 Expression Distinguishes Classical and Basal-like Subtypes in Advanced Pancreatic Cancer Clin. Cancer Res. 2020; 26 :4901-4910 Crossref Scopus (178) PubMed Google Scholar ), a deserted-dominant TME strongly associated with poor response ( Figure 6 B) and least average tumor size change ( Figure 6 C) during 1 st -line chemotherapy. This appeared to be due to effects in both Gemcitabine plus nab-Paclitaxel (GnP)- and FOLFIRINOX (FFX)-treated patients ( Figure S6 A), yet the GnP-treated subgroup was too small for a robust observation. We therefore carried 3 PDO models (2 responders and 1 non-responder from above Gemcitabine experiment) forth into combination drug assays with all active agents from the FFX and GnP regimens. CM from deserted-type CAFs exhibited chemoprotective effects against both FFX and GnP combinations in 2 out of 3 PDOs ( Figure 6 D). In patients, deserted-dominant TME frequency was highest in patients with progressive disease and decreased stepwise to patients with stable disease and partial responders ( Figure 6 E). Consequently, a deserted-dominant TME was associated with poor prognosis ( Figure 6 F) and remained an independent prognostic factor in multivariable analysis ( Figure S6 B). Altogether, deserted subTMEs negatively affected late-stage outcome through protective effects against 1 st -line chemo-regimens administered to PDAC patients.
We next asked whether chemotherapy can affect the TME state. Neoadjuvant treated PDACs (n = 40) more frequently exhibited a deserted-dominant TME, compared to stage-matched treatment-naive cases (n = 157; Figure 6 G). Moreover, while 23/40 (57%) neoadjuvant-treated cases still exhibited multiple subTME, a frequency similar to treatment-naive resections ( Figures 1 H and 1I), they were composed almost exclusively of deserted and intermediate subTMEs: the presence of any reactive TME area dropped dramatically, i.e., 52/143 (36.4%) in treatment-naive cases and 1/40 (2.5%) in neoadjuvant, indicating an overall more homogeneous and deserted-like TME composition. This was accompanied by lower stromal immunoreactivity for IL-6 and FAPα ( Figure 6 H), indicative of a more deserted-like CAF phenotype ( Figures 4 L–4M). In 15 pairs of patient-matched pre-/post-treatment biopsies ( Figure 6 I), we observed shifts from a reactive- or intermediate-dominant to a deserted-dominant phenotype in 9/15 cases and 1/15 reactive to intermediate shift; 4/15 remained deserted or intermediate, respectively. One case exhibited a “reverse” shift (deserted to intermediate), accompanied by a shift in epithelial phenotype from classic to basal-like. Overall, deserted subTMEs became more frequent upon chemotherapy and had a chemoprotective effect, at least in part mediated by CAFs. Chemoprotection ( Figure 6 ) and disease promotion ( Figure 5 ) thus appeared to be independent stromal support functions, executed by deserted and reactive subTMEs, respectively.
Finally, we examined whether we could leverage subTME-specific expression patterns to infer TME phenotypes and heterogeneity from public bulk RNA-seq profiles ( Figure 7 A). A Random Forest model was trained on reactive versus deserted subTME transcriptomes (n = 23). 72 genes were selected by their impact score in the model and the overall impact score distribution ( Figure S7 A; Table S5 ). The resulting “TME PHENOtyper” model reached 95.7% accuracy (22/23 samples with subTME score >0.6) at a virtual tumor content of 48% ( Figure 7 B) and was then applied to 177 bulk tissue RNA-seq profiles from the TCGA PAAD dataset ( Figure 7 C). TME PHENOtyper predicted the dominant TME state slightly better in samples with high compared to low stromal content (performance of 93.4% at >50% stroma versus 84.2% at <50% stroma; Figure 7 D), but subTME scores did not correlate with ABSOLUTE-based ( Carter et al., 2012 8. Carter, S.L. ∙ Cibulskis, K. ∙ Helman, E. ... Absolute quantification of somatic DNA alterations in human cancer Nat. Biotechnol. 2012; 30 :413-421 Crossref Scopus (1429) PubMed Google Scholar ) tumor cellularity estimates ( Figure S7 B), altogether indicating the model is robust against varying tumor content in bulk samples. Overall accuracy was 74.8% ( Table S6 ) when benchmarked against histopathological review.
We then tested whether TME PHENOtyper could discern prognostic patient subgroups by using subTME scores as a proxy for both TME heterogeneity and TME state ( Figure 7 E). A predicted single dominating TME state (top 15% reactive versus deserted scores) was not associated with survival ( Figure S7 C). Yet, in line with the survival differences between patients with one main TME phenotype versus co-occurring subTMEs ( Figure 1 K), a high subTME score (top 25% reactive or deserted score; “one main subTME”) yielded better outcome compared to scores reflecting a “subTME mix” (50% quantile with moderate reactive and deserted scores; Figure 7 F). Separation of survival curves further increased when using top 12.5% quantiles ( Figure 7 G), suggesting that increased TME heterogeneity as a function of subTME co-occurrence is continuously associated with poor patient outcomes.

Section: Discussion

Intratumoral heterogeneity is a long-standing obstacle to defining precise stromal contributions to cancer progression and chemoresistance ( Vickman et al., 2020 51. Vickman, R.E. ∙ Faget, D.V. ∙ Beachy, P. ... Deconstructing tumor heterogeneity: the stromal perspective Oncotarget. 2020; 11 :3621-3632 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Vitale et al., 2021 52. Vitale, I. ∙ Shema, E. ∙ Loi, S. ... Intratumoral heterogeneity in cancer progression and response to immunotherapy Nat. Med. 2021; 27 :212-224 Crossref Scopus (395) PubMed Google Scholar ). This study systematically integrates clinical histopathology with multi-tiered OMICs analyses and reveals how stromal heterogeneity in PDAC is a function of regional TME programs, which cooperate to actively drive tumor progression. Specifically, we discover two overarching microenvironmental states with distinct tumor-promoting and chemo-protective roles in human PDAC. The underlying reactive and deserted subTMEs display regional variance in TME composition, phenotype, and function. Namely, reactive subTMEs were vascularized, immune hot, and tumor promoting but appeared more chemo-sensitive. They frequently co-existed intratumorally with deserted subTMEs, which supported tumor differentiation, but were chemoprotective in vitro and associated with poor treatment response in patients. Accordingly, tumors benefited from the concomitant presence of reactive and deserted subTMEs, resulting in poor outcome for patients with a phenotypically heterogenous TME.
CAFs are a central element in establishing subTMEs. We unexpectedly observed up to 11 subpopulations in subTME CAF cultures, unified in their subTME-specific differentiation states, that together established coordinated phenotypes with distinct behavior and function. We observed known iCAF/myCAF-like subpopulations ( Elyada et al., 2019 17. Elyada, E. ∙ Bolisetty, M. ∙ Laise, P. ... Cross-Species Single-Cell Analysis of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Reveals Antigen-Presenting Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts Cancer Discov. 2019; 9 :1102-1123 Crossref Scopus (1104) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kieffer et al., 2020 26. Kieffer, Y. ∙ Hocine, H.R. ∙ Gentric, G. ... Single-Cell Analysis Reveals Fibroblast Clusters Linked to Immunotherapy Resistance in Cancer Cancer Discov. 2020; 10 :1330-1351 Crossref Scopus (432) PubMed Google Scholar ), along with additional subpopulations across the continuum of CAF differentiation states from deserted to intermediary to reactive subTMEs. SubTMEs thus represent organizational units of multi-subpopulation CAF communities, likely much more nuanced in tissues than in our in vitro cultures. Noticeably, this CAF differentiation potential was associated with distinct tumor-related functions and, similar to stem cells ( Gulati et al., 2020 21. Gulati, G.S. ∙ Sikandar, S.S. ∙ Wesche, D.J. ... Single-cell transcriptional diversity is a hallmark of developmental potential Science. 2020; 367 :405-411 Crossref Scopus (457) PubMed Google Scholar ), was marked by RNA diversity and pluripotency markers. In sum, regional TME heterogeneity in PDAC appears to result largely from transitions between subpopulation-overarching fibroblast differentiation states that regionally govern multifaceted CAF and immune cell communities. Consequently, the PDAC TME, despite its complexity and the myriad possible combinations of its inhabiting cell populations, may de facto self-organize into relatively few states of functional relevance. While our current understanding of the processes governing tissue self-organization and patterning is limited ( Muthuswamy, 2021 36. Muthuswamy, S.K. Self-organization in cancer: implications for histopathology, cancer cell biology, and metastasis Cancer Cell. 2021; 39 :443-446 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ; Xavier da Silveira Dos Santos and Liberali, 2019 54. Xavier da Silveira Dos Santos, A. ∙ Liberali, P. From single cells to tissue self-organization FEBS J. 2019; 286 :1495-1513 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ), the conservation of the here-identified subTME histological patterns across PDAC stages and disease sites suggests they reflect a defined and reproducible repertoire of tissue responses to chronic injury, which warrants the investigation of such regional TME states in other cancers.
Stromal heterogeneity, defined as co-occurrence of different subTMEs within a single patient, was strongly linked to poor outcome. Our findings suggest that tumors with such heterogenous TMEs have concomitant access to tumor-promoting and chemo-protective elements so that the poor survival likely results from complementary effects of subTMEs on tumor pathobiology. SubTMEs exhibited specific functions that bear weight at different disease stages, namely, promoting aggressive progression (influential in early-stage settings) versus treatment resistance (decisive at late stages), highlighting stage-specific net effects of regional TME states on disease biology and patient outcomes. Future studies will likely assign additional functions to and functional subclasses within the main subTME types reactive and deserted. Our compartment-specific approach revealed that reactive subTME and the epithelial basal-like/squamous subtype were partially linked in a regional and a global manner, which is especially significant in light of recent findings that these epithelial subtypes, like subTMEs, often co-exist in the same tumor ( Chan-Seng-Yue et al., 2020 10. Chan-Seng-Yue, M. ∙ Kim, J.C. ∙ Wilson, G.W. ... Transcription phenotypes of pancreatic cancer are driven by genomic events during tumor evolution Nat. Genet. 2020; 52 :231-240 Crossref Scopus (344) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hayashi et al., 2020 22. Hayashi, A. ∙ Fan, J. ∙ Chen, R. ... A unifying paradigm for transcriptional heterogeneity and squamous features in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma Nat. Can. 2020; 1 :59-74 Crossref Scopus (107) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our findings and other studies ( Ligorio et al., 2019 30. Ligorio, M. ∙ Sil, S. ∙ Malagon-Lopez, J. ... Stromal Microenvironment Shapes the Intratumoral Architecture of Pancreatic Cancer Cell. 2019; 178 :160-175 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (367) PubMed Google Scholar ) suggest that heterogeneity in the TME and epithelial compartments can be coupled. Moreover, subTMEs instigated regional immune heterogeneity and reactive subTMEs presented as distinct immune-hot regions. This supports known links between squamous differentiation and tissue inflammation ( Somerville et al., 2020 47. Somerville, T.D. ∙ Biffi, G. ∙ Daßler-Plenker, J. ... Squamous trans-differentiation of pancreatic cancer cells promotes stromal inflammation eLife. 2020; 9 :e53381 Crossref Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar ) and ties the here-identified regional TME states to both epithelial and immune heterogeneity. SubTME-anchored regional immune heterogeneity has implications for PDAC immunotherapy design and patient selection. Beyond that, the frequent chemotherapy-induced shifts toward the poorly vascularized, ECM-rich, and chemoprotective deserted phenotype suggest a role of TME states in acquired chemoresistance. Agents that can attenuate the deserted TME state thus have major potential for improving therapy response across neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and palliative settings. Resolution of subTME-specific executor versus bystander CAF subpopulations involved in these disease-relevant effects, along with their effector molecules, will be a key step toward precise heterogeneity-informed targets.
Altogether, this study reveals the existence of two fundamental microenvironmental states, rooted in fibroblast plasticity, that produce functional intratumoral heterogeneity of the pancreatic TME. We demonstrate how the resultant ability to regionally pinpoint the tumor ecosystem’s state, facilitated by standard histopathology and computational tools, not only complements but radically streamlines the extraction of knowledge from deep molecular profiling, immune phenotyping, and patient outcome data. With approximately 50% of the TME proteome differentially expressed between deserted and reactive regions, subTME-based stratification of specimens and patients could propel our understanding of functionally relevant TME states and simplify the urgent quest for stromal targets and biomarkers in PDAC and beyond.
Our analysis of subTME CAFs and related functional assays utilized cultured cells that were extracted from samples with confirmed subTMEs. SubTME multi-subpopulation profiles are likely much more nuanced in tissues and should be experimentally verified by high-content imaging techniques such as imaging mass cytometry. From advanced PDAC stages, only biopsy-size samples were available, since these patients are ineligible for surgery. To avoid potential sampling bias effects, we refrained from assessing subTME co-occurrence in biopsy samples and only report the dominating TME phenotype. Diagnostic imaging-based subTME biomarkers have the capacity to enable whole lesion subTME assessment for advanced stages as well as longitudinal analyses.

The study includes 414 specimens from 393 individuals (both female (n = 185) and male (n = 208); median age: 64 years) with histologic diagnosis of PDAC (143 resectable tumor specimens from treatment-naive patients with stage I/II PDAC; 40 resectable tumor specimens from neoadjuvant-treated PDAC patients; 210 diagnostic biopsy specimens and 15 patient-paired longitudinal biopsies from 210 stage III/IV PDAC patients). A summary of the patient cohort including age and sex of subjects is provided in Table S1 . All patients provided written informed consent allowing the molecular characterization of their tumor samples and follow-up on their clinical information. Resectable tumors were obtained from the UHN Biospecimens Program, and advanced tumors were obtained from the COMPASS trial (no. NCT02750657). Patient samples were mostly accrued at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre at the University Health Network (Toronto, Canada) and reported in previous studies ( Aung et al., 2018 2.

All studies were approved by University Health Network Research Ethics Board (Nos. 03-0049, 08-0767, 15-9596, 17-6106, 16-5380). The study complies with all relevant ethical regulations.
The validation cohort consisted of 177 PDAC patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)( Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2017 7. Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network Integrated Genomic Characterization of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Cancer Cell. 2017; 32 :185-203 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1223) PubMed Google Scholar ) data portal. The TCGA database was accessed on February 3rd, 2020 via the TCGAbiolinks package ( Colaprico et al., 2016 11. Colaprico, A. ∙ Silva, T.C. ∙ Olsen, C. ... TCGAbiolinks: an R/Bioconductor package for integrative analysis of TCGA data Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44 :e71 Crossref Scopus (2178) PubMed Google Scholar ). 182 PAAD RNaseq V2 datasets were downloaded for analyses. Five samples were filtered out due to annotation of a non-pancreas primary site.
This study used 5 human PDAC PDO models. PDO models were generated by the Princess Margaret Living Biobank core facility using previously described protocols ( Boj et al., 2015 5. Boj, S.F. ∙ Hwang, C.-I. ∙ Baker, L.A. ... Organoid models of human and mouse ductal pancreatic cancer Cell. 2015; 160 :324-338 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1492) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, fresh PDAC tissue was cut into small pieces and washed with ice cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Tumor tissue was further dissociated to single cells or small clumps of cells using Liberase TH (Sigma Aldrich) in Advanced DMEM (GIBCO) for 1 hour followed by 10-minute incubation with TrypLE Express (Invitrogen). Dissociated cells were collected, embedded in 100% growth factor-reduced Matrigel (VWR), plated in 24-well tissue culture plates as Matrigel domes and overlaid with growth medium ( Boj et al., 2015 5. Boj, S.F. ∙ Hwang, C.-I. ∙ Baker, L.A. ... Organoid models of human and mouse ductal pancreatic cancer Cell. 2015; 160 :324-338 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1492) PubMed Google Scholar ). PDOs were maintained in maintained at 37°C in 5% CO 2 . The identity of PDOs was authenticated by short tandem repeat (STR) analysis and matched to patient tissue. PDO cultures were tested routinely for mycoplasma contamination.
Fresh human PDAC tissues from 13 patients were minced into 1 mm 3 pieces using a scalpel. Several pieces were placed in 4% formalin for subsequent paraffin embedding and histopathological assessment to determine subTMEs of the originating tissue specimens. In parallel, 5-8 pieces were plated per well on a 6-well plate in 800 μl isolation medium (DMEM/F12, 20% FBS, GlutaMAX, HEPES, Anti/Anti). Plates were placed in an incubator and media were replaced the next day and every 48 h thereafter. After 7-22 days, outgrowth of fibroblasts was observed. Cells were passaged using 0.05% trypsin when fibrotic septae formation began. Subsequent culturing was done in FBS-reduced growth medium (DMEM/F12, 8% FBS, GlutaMAX, HEPES, Anti/Anti). Cells were passaged subconfluently in fixed intervals 2 times per week using 0.05% trypsin. Purity of the cultures was assessed at passage 5 using single cell RNA sequencing. Cell assign determined all cells to be CAFs based on expression of marker genes COL1A1, COL3A1, FAP, THY1, PDGFRB, VIM, ACTA2, CDH11, ENG; details on single cell sequencing and the cell assign package are provided in the Methods details below.
Haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained slides from all patients were reviewed by a pathologist (SF). Whole sections from all available tumor-containing FFPE blocks (206 blocks from 143 resectable PDAC cases) and diagnostic biopsy cores from 210 advanced PDAC cases were semiquantitatively assessed for the presence of specific, reproducible morphological patterns. Histopathological categories were built from a combination of known stromal histomorphological features mentioned in the relevant PDAC literature ( Bolm et al., 2017 6.

Cancer. 2014; 111 :1917-1923 Crossref Scopus (114) PubMed Google Scholar ), such as differences in fibroblast morphology, fibroblast density, and connective tissue fiber density and alignment, as well as additional stromal morphological metrics, such as fiber maturation, myxoid or keloid features, and orientation to malignant epithelium. This was achieved in two steps: First, we systematically recorded both the presence and spatial confinement of all individual features. Then, since we specifically aimed to define recurrent stromal functional/organizational units, we assessed which of these individual features coincided regionally and how they recurred across patients, sites, and stages. This process identified 1. ‘deserted’ subTMEs, defined as paucicellular region with thin, spindle-shaped fibroblasts embedded in loose extracellular matrix and fully matured collagen fibers, often with keloid and myxoid features; 2. ‘reactive’ subTMEs, defined as region containing fibroblasts with plump morphology and enlarged nuclei, little acellular components but often a rich inflammatory infiltrate; 3. regions with intermediate levels of these features, which were recorded as ‘intermediate’ subTMEs. Subsequently, all subTMEs present per case were recorded and the subTME with > 50% estimated area contribution was assigned as main TME phenotype/state per case. Presence of multiple subTMEs is only reported for resections, not for biopsy-size specimens, to minimize the impact of a possible sampling bias. Tumor differentiation was assessed from the same specimens using the standard pathological grading scheme into either well differentiated, moderately differentiated, and poorly differentiated based on the lowest differentiation grade observed. HE slide scans from diagnostic specimen of 159 cases for the TCGA validation cohort were obtained from https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/ and assessed identically.
Within the resection cohort (n = 143), 37 cases were not suitable for LCM/multiOMIC profiling due to one or several of the following reasons: atypical tumor morphology (n = 6), insufficient material (n = 3), insufficient stromal content (< 50%; n = 22), no matched high-quality whole genome sequencing (WGS) available (n = 4), homologous recombination-repair deficiency ( Golan et al., 2021 20. Golan, T. ∙ O’Kane, G.M. ∙ Denroche, R.E. ... Genomic Features and Classification of Homologous Recombination Deficient Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Gastroenterology. 2021; 160 :2119-2132 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (86) PubMed Google Scholar )(n = 9) and/or other rare genomic events (n = 3). Of the remaining 106 cases, 32 were randomly selected for profiling.
For these, subTME profiles were assessed from HEs of all available FFPE and fresh frozen blocks (102 blocks from 32 cases). Then, one representative well-preserved frozen block per case was selected and LCM of freshly frozen tissue samples was performed on a Leica LMD 7000 instrument as previously described ( Connor et al., 2019 13. Connor, A.A. ∙ Denroche, R.E. ∙ Jang, G.H. ... Integration of Genomic and Transcriptional Features in Pancreatic Cancer Reveals Increased Cell Cycle Progression in Metastases Cancer Cell. 2019; 35 :267-282 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (142) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, frozen tissue maintained in vapor-phase liquid nitrogen was embedded in OCT cutting medium and sectioned in a cryotome into 10-μm thick sections. 9-14 sections per case were mounted on PEN membrane slides (Zeiss) and lightly stained with hematoxylin to facilitate microscopic identification of tumor and stroma areas. One adjacent section per case was hematoxylin-eosin (HE) stained and used in parallel at a light microscope to aid histologic confirmation of subTME and tumoral features. LCM was performed within 48 h after sections were cut to minimize nucleic acid and protein degradation.
First, microdissected tumor epithelium from defined subTME regions was collected by gravity into the caps of sterile, RNase-free microcentrifuge tubes. Approximately 50,000-100,000 tumor cells were collected for each RNA and protein extraction sample. Next, any non-TME components (e.g., residual acini and normal ducts, large blood vessels, nerves, scattered tumor nests) were microdissected from the TME and discarded. Finally, approximately 50,000 cells from thereby cleaned subTME-specific stromal regions were collected for each RNA and protein extraction samples. Arcturus PicoPure Extraction Buffer was added directly to RNA extraction samples, while protein extraction samples were spun down and left dry. All samples were then stored at −80°C until further processing.
Shotgun proteomics on dissected fractions from OCT embedded tissue has been described previously ( Sinha et al., 2019 45. Sinha, A. ∙ Huang, V. ∙ Livingstone, J. ... The Proteogenomic Landscape of Curable Prostate Cancer Cancer Cell. 2019; 35 :414-427 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1) PubMed Google Scholar ). Removal of the OCT compound was performed using various dilutions of ethanol with water as follows. At each step, the tubes were centrifuged at 13,200 g for 3 min, and the supernatant was discarded. Initially, 1 mL of 70% (v/v) ethanol was added to each conical tube, followed by 30 s of vortexing. Subsequently, tissue pellets were resuspended with 100 μL of 100% ethanol, 70% ethanol, 85% ethanol and 100% ethanol with an additional 5 min incubation at room temperature and 30 s vortexing. Finally, pellets were washed with PBS twice, spun down, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C until further processing. Pellets were then resuspended in 100 μL of 50% trifluoroethanol (TFE) in PBS and subsequently lysed by five freeze-thaw cycles. Lysis was further ensured by four ten-second cycles of probe-less sonication at maximum intensity (VialTeeter, Hielscher Ultrasound Technology). Proteins were solubilized by incubating the samples at 60°C for two hours. The proteins were denatured with the addition of dithiothreitol (DTT) to a concentration of 5mM and incubated for thirty minutes at 60°C, and then alkylated with the addition of iodoacetamide (IAA) to a concentration of 25 mM and incubated for another thirty minutes at room temperature in the dark. The proteins were diluted 1:5 with 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate and digested overnight at 37°C following the addition of 1 μg of Trypsin/Lys-C protease mixture (Promega) and calcium chloride to a concentration of 1 mM. The following morning, formic acid was added to each sample to a concentration of 1% and the undigested tissue was pelleted for 10 minutes in a centrifuge at 4°C. The supernatant was lyophilized and the resultant dried peptides were resuspended in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The peptides were purified and desalted C18-based solid-phase capture and the eluted with 80% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water. Eluted peptides were once again lyophilized and resuspended in 25 μL of 0.1% formic acid. Peptide concentrations were determined by Nanodrop Lite spectrophotometer.
Two micrograms of peptide were loaded onto a 2 cm trap column (Thermo Scientific) using an Easy1000 nanoLC (Thermo Scientific). The peptides were separated and detected along a four-hour reversed-phase gradient using a 50cm EasySpray analytical C18 column coupled by electrospray ionization to a Q-Exactive HF Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) operating in a Top 25 data-dependent acquisition mode. MS 1 data was acquired at a resolution of 120,000 with an AGC target of 3e6 ions and a maximum fill time of 240 ms. MS 2 data was acquired at a resolution of 30,000 with an AGC target of 2e5 ions and a maximum fill time of 55 ms. A dynamic exclusion of 60 s was enabled, and the normalized collision energy was set to 27%.
The acquired raw data was searched using Maxquant (version 1.5.8.3) against a UniProt complete human protein sequence database (v2018_10). Two missed cleavages were permitted along with the fixed carbamidomethyl modification of cysteines, the variable oxidation of methionine and variable acetylation of the protein N terminus. Relative label-free protein quantitation was calculated using MS 1 -level peak integration along with the matching-between-runs feature enabling a 2 min retention time matching window. False discovery rate (FDR) was set to 1% for peptide spectral matches and protein identification using a target-decoy strategy. The protein groups file was filtered for proteins identified by a minimum of two peptides and then used to carry out further analysis. The distribution of LFQ intensities were adjusted to match that of iBAQ intensities so that LFQ values could be imputed in place of missing iBAQ intensities ( Wojtowicz et al., 2016 53. Wojtowicz, E.E. ∙ Lechman, E.R. ∙ Hermans, K.G. ... Ectopic miR-125a Expression Induces Long-Term Repopulating Stem Cell Capacity in Mouse and Human Hematopoietic Progenitors Cell Stem Cell. 2016; 19 :383-396 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, quantitative comprehensiveness was increased by imputing missing quantitative values with random values from a low-end normal distribution. Thereby, a total of 5,708 protein groups were quantified across 33 tumor-TME paired samples. The tumor and stroma samples belonging to patient #28 were removed from differential expression analysis since this patient was later re-classified as a case with unknown primary site. See Table S7 for fully processed proteomic profiles.
From LCM tissue, RNA was isolated using the PicoPure RNA Isolation Kit (Thermo Fisher). RNA was treated with the RNase-free DNase Set (QIAGEN) and quantified using the Qubit dsRNA High Sensitivity kit (Invitrogen). Quality was measured using both the RNA Screen Tape Assay (Agilent) in combination with the 2200 TapeStation Nucleic Acid System. RNA-sequencing (RNaseq) analysis was performed at the Ontario Institute of Cancer Research (Ontario, Canada) as described previously ( Connor et al., 2019 13. Connor, A.A. ∙ Denroche, R.E. ∙ Jang, G.H. ... Integration of Genomic and Transcriptional Features in Pancreatic Cancer Reveals Increased Cell Cycle Progression in Metastases Cancer Cell. 2019; 35 :267-282 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (142) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, RNA libraries were prepared using the TruSeq RNA Access Library Sample prep kit (Illumina). Library pools were quantified on the Eco Real-Time PCR Instrument using KAPA Illumina Library Quantification Kits. All above steps were performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Paired-end cluster generation and sequencing of 2 × 126 cycles was carried out for all libraries on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform.
Paired-end raw Fastq files were trimmed using the following settings: HEADCROP:3 TRAILING:10 MINLEN:25 for Trimmomatic v2.38, to remove adaptor content and bad quality reads. Trimmed fastqs were mapped to the human GRCH37 genome assembly using STAR v2.6.0 ( Dobin et al., 2013 15. Dobin, A. ∙ Davis, C.A. ∙ Schlesinger, F. ... STAR: ultrafast universal RNA-seq aligner Bioinformatics. 2013; 29 :15-21 Crossref Scopus (27042) PubMed Google Scholar ) using the following settings:–outFilterType BySJout–outFilterMultimapNmax 10–alignSJoverhangMin 8–alignSJDBoverhangMin 1–outFilterMismatchNmax 999–outFilterMismatchNoverLmax 0.05 i–alignIntronMin 20–alignIntronMax 1000000–alignMatesGapMax 1000000–outFilterMatchNmin 16–quantMode GeneCounts–runThreadN 12. Genes quantified in at least 75% of total samples were filtered-in.
Primary human PDAC CAF cultures were multiplexed for single-cell RNA-sequencing using lipid-tagged indices (MULTI-seq) ( McGinnis et al., 2019a 32. McGinnis, C.S. ∙ Patterson, D.M. ∙ Winkler, J. ... MULTI-seq: sample multiplexing for single-cell RNA sequencing using lipid-tagged indices Nat. Methods. 2019; 16 :619-626 Crossref Scopus (296) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, primary human PDAC CAF cultures from 10 patients were trypsinised, washed twice with 1x PBS, and counted. Next, CAF single-cell suspensions (5x10 5 cells/CAF line) were incubated with mixture of a unique barcode oligonucleotide and anchor lipid-modified oligonucleotide at 37°C for 10 minutes, followed by addition of a co-anchor and incubated for 5 minutes on ice. All subsequent steps are performed on ice or spun at 4°C. Excess barcodes were quenched with 1 mL 1% BSA in 1x PBS solution in two consecutive washing steps at 400 g for 5 min before cells were suspended in a final solution of 0.4% BSA in 1xPBS. Cells from all samples were pooled at equal numbers to target 2x10 4 cells in the final transcript library. Standard protocols for the Single Cell 3′ RNA kit v3 (10x Genomics) were used. Sequencing was performed using the NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina) as per the standard 10x configuration.
Raw sequencing reads were aligned using CellRanger 3.1.0 with the GRCh38-3.0.0 human genome as reference. MULTI-seq data quality-control was performed using the R packages deMULTIplex v1.0.2 ( McGinnis et al., 2019a 32. McGinnis, C.S. ∙ Patterson, D.M. ∙ Winkler, J. ... MULTI-seq: sample multiplexing for single-cell RNA sequencing using lipid-tagged indices Nat. Methods. 2019; 16 :619-626 Crossref Scopus (296) PubMed Google Scholar ), DoubletFinder_v3 ( McGinnis et al., 2019b 33. McGinnis, C.S. ∙ Murrow, L.M. ∙ Gartner, Z.J. DoubletFinder: Doublet Detection in Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Data Using Artificial Nearest Neighbors Cell Syst. 2019; 8 :329-337 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1321) PubMed Google Scholar ) and Seurat (v3.2.2). Briefly, following demultiplexing of the 10 samples included in this study by their unique barcodes, homotypic doublets and unlabeled cells were removed from downstream analysis using deMULTIplex. DoubletFinder was used to identify heterotypic doublets by using the homotypic doublet rate identified by deMULTIplex as input for nExp argument, yielding a total of 8,375 labeled, single cells. Finally, 6,331 cells exhibiting < 3% mitochondrial gene expression and > 200 unique genes per cell were carried forth for analysis.
Cell cycle phase was annotated using the CellCycleScoring function in Seurat, with the difference between S and G2M phase scores used as input to the vars.to.regress argument within the ScaleData function. An ordered trajectory across CAF phenotypes was inferred applying the CytoTRACE computational framework ( Gulati et al., 2020 21. Gulati, G.S. ∙ Sikandar, S.S. ∙ Wesche, D.J. ... Single-cell transcriptional diversity is a hallmark of developmental potential Science. 2020; 367 :405-411 Crossref Scopus (457) PubMed Google Scholar ) to cells with > 1000 unique genes. Selected genes related to CAF-activation ( FAP, ACTA2, S100A4 , IL6, IL1B, NNMT) and cell plasticity ( NT5E, ENO1, ITGB1, CD44, LGALS1, KIT) are presented as a smoothing spline of the moving average of gene expression across 200 cells.
Cell types were assigned using CellAssign (v00.99.21) that computes a cell type probability given a curated set of gene markers as input (Fibroblast: COL1A1, COL3A1, FAP, THY1, PDGFRB, VIM, ACTA2, CDH11, ENG ; Epithelial cell: EPCAM, CDH1, CLDN3, CLDN4 ; B cell: PTPRC, CD19, CD79A, CD79B ; T cell: PTPRC, CD4, CTLA4, FOXP3 ; Vascular endothelial cell: VIM, EMCN, CLEC14A, CDH5, VWF, CD34, PECAM1 ; Macrophage/monocyte: CD14, CD68, CSF1R, FGFR3, CD33, LYZ ; Pericyte: MCAM, CSPG4 ; Lymphatic endothelial cell: LYVE1, PROX1 ) with min_delta = 3 and learning_rate = 1e-2.
For human PDAC LCM tissue transcriptomes and proteomes, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were determined using the R/Bioconductor package limma ( Ritchie et al., 2015 43. Ritchie, M.E. ∙ Phipson, B. ∙ Wu, D. ... limma powers differential expression analyses for RNA-sequencing and microarray studies Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43 :e47 Crossref Scopus (21698) PubMed Google Scholar ). Genes were considered as significantly regulated with an adjusted p value threshold at 0.05 (Benjamini-Hochberg) and a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05. For single cell RNaseq profiles from human PDAC CAFs, DEGs were determined using the FindAllMarkers function in Seurat using the following settings: only.pos = TRUE, min.pct = 0.25, logfc.threshold = 0.25.
For human PDAC LCM tissue transcriptomes and proteomes, a two-sample t test method ( gage R package) was used to retrieve enriched gene sets from differential gene expression patterns in the integrated normalized RNA and protein intensities. Gene sets were obtained from the Gene Ontology collection (biological process) of MSigDB v7.0 ( Subramanian et al., 2005 49. Subramanian, A. ∙ Tamayo, P. ∙ Mootha, V.K. ... Gene set enrichment analysis: a knowledge-based approach for interpreting genome-wide expression profiles Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102 :15545-15550 Crossref Scopus (33572) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the ConsensusPathDB database ( Herwig et al., 2016 23. Herwig, R. ∙ Hardt, C. ∙ Lienhard, M. ... Analyzing and interpreting genome data at the network level with ConsensusPathDB Nat. Protoc. 2016; 11 :1889-1907 Crossref Scopus (296) PubMed Google Scholar ). Significance threshold was set to an adjusted p value below 0.05. Enrichment results were visualized either as bar graphs of adjusted p values or in Cytoscape (v3.7.1) ( Shannon et al., 2003 44. Shannon, P. ∙ Markiel, A. ∙ Ozier, O. ... Cytoscape: a software environment for integrated models of biomolecular interaction networks Genome Res. 2003; 13 :2498-2504 Crossref Scopus (32512) PubMed Google Scholar ) using the Enrichment Map App ( Merico et al., 2010 34. Merico, D. ∙ Isserlin, R. ∙ Stueker, O. ... Enrichment map: a network-based method for gene-set enrichment visualization and interpretation PLoS ONE. 2010; 5 :e13984 Crossref Scopus (1553) PubMed Google Scholar ). For single cell RNaseq profiles from human PDAC CAFs, enrichment of HALLMARK gene sets ( Liberzon et al., 2015 29. Liberzon, A. ∙ Birger, C. ∙ Thorvaldsdóttir, H. ... The Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) hallmark gene set collection Cell Syst. 2015; 1 :417-425 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (6393) PubMed Google Scholar ) and previously published CAF subpopulation gene sets (ecm_myCAF, TGFB_myCAF, wound_myCAF, detox_iCAF, IL_iCAF, IFNy_iCAF [ Kieffer et al., 2020 26. Kieffer, Y. ∙ Hocine, H.R. ∙ Gentric, G. ... Single-Cell Analysis Reveals Fibroblast Clusters Linked to Immunotherapy Resistance in Cancer Cancer Discov. 2020; 10 :1330-1351 Crossref Scopus (432) PubMed Google Scholar ]; iCAF and myCAF signatures [ Elyada et al., 2019 17. Elyada, E. ∙ Bolisetty, M. ∙ Laise, P. ... Cross-Species Single-Cell Analysis of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Reveals Antigen-Presenting Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts Cancer Discov. 2019; 9 :1102-1123 Crossref Scopus (1104) PubMed Google Scholar ]) was determined using a Fisher’s exact test on markers identified for each clusters. Significance threshold was set to adjusted p value below 0.05.
The dataset used for building the classifier included 23 subTME RNaseq profiles from reactive and deserted subTMEs (n = 11 reactive, n = 12 deserted). Data was pre-processed by centering and scaling samples via the preProcess function from the R package caret. The entire cohort was used as training dataset. The classifier was build using a random forest classification method from the randomForest R package with Leave-One-Out-Cross-Validation (LOOCV). The features selection was performed in two steps; first, an impact score was calculated for all 23,271 genes, then 72 genes with the highest score were selected ( Figure S6 A) for building the TME PHENOtyper model. Finally, a new impact score was calculated for each of these genes. To determine the robustness of the classifier against varying stroma amounts in the sample (“pseudo-bulk test”), in-silico samples were generated from the 23 TME samples and their paired malignant epithelium samples. These artificial samples were created by merging X% of the tumor associated sample count and 100-X% of the stroma sample count. For each pair of samples, 101 in-silico samples were obtained by iteratively decreasing the stroma amount by 1% increments from 100% (i.e., pure TME sample) to 0% (i.e., pure tumor sample). For validation analysis, the model was used to predict subTME scores from TCGA PAAD cohort and validated against histopathological assessment of main/predominant subTME states.
Construction of the PDAC tissue microarray (TMAs) was described previously ( Connor et al., 2017 12. Connor, A.A. ∙ Denroche, R.E. ∙ Jang, G.H. ... Association of Distinct Mutational Signatures With Correlates of Increased Immune Activity in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma JAMA Oncol. 2017; 3 :774-783 Crossref Scopus (213) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, H&E sections from research paraffin blocks were reviewed by a pathologist for tumor morphology and content. An optimal area for TMA coring was marked for each block. Tissue cores (1.2 mm) were punched manually and transferred into TMA recipient paraffin blocks. Additional cores of benign pancreatic, renal, pulmonary, and hepatic tissues were included for control and TMA orientation reference purposes. For each case, multiple tumor cores were arrayed (2-4-fold redundancy) from the paraffin blocks. In total, 596 core tissue samples were obtained from 165 PDAC patients (143 treatment-naive, 23 neoadjuvant-treated) and assembled to a tissue microarray comprising 13 slides.
Consecutive sections from above-described TMA were reviewed by a pathologist (SF) to assign the subTME present in each core and stained with Masson’s Trichrome, and Picrosirius Red and a 23-antibody panel according to standard laboratory procedures (see Key resources table for antibody details). For IHC, DAB+ (3,3-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride) was used as a chromogen, which produces a dark brown precipitate readily detected by light microscopy. Nuclei were counterstained with hematoxylin. All slides were digitized for subsequent quantification by image analysis.
Stains were quantified using QuPath bioimage analysis software ( Bankhead et al., 2017 4. Bankhead, P. ∙ Loughrey, M.B. ∙ Fernández, J.A. ... QuPath: Open source software for digital pathology image analysis Sci. Rep. 2017; 7 :16878 Crossref Scopus (3655) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, region of Interest (ROI) grids were placed onto each slide and unique patient identifiers were superimposed onto the grids. Simple Tissue Detection tool was used to select for all tissue within the ROI and exclude white space. Areas containing residual normal pancreas epithelium, nerves, large blood vessels, tissue folds and stain artifact were manually excluded. Pixel-based or cell-based detection parameters were manually set and optimized for each stain. Quantification results were quality controlled by visual inspection of the 10 cores with the highest detected staining levels and the 10 cores with the lowest detected staining levels for each slide for each stain.
To account for compartment-specific expression of the markers, tumor (CK19+) and stroma (CK19-) area was measured using the Cytokeratin Annotation tool to obtain tumor/total and stroma/total area ratios for each core ( Figure S3 A). These were used to normalize a subset of compartment-specific stains, including fibroblast markers (FAPα, αSMA) and myeloid cell markers (CD15, CD11b, CD68, CD206). In addition, the Cell Detection tool was used to obtain CK19+ and CK19- cell counts for each core to facilitate estimation of stromal cellularity. For ki67 staining, a classifier was created to annotate cells as either tumor or stromal. Briefly, the Cell Detection method was run to select all cells in the tissue. A Random Forest Classifier was then trained based on manual annotations of tumor or stroma and used to finally enumerate ki67+ tumor cells. CD3+ and CD8+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), defined as a CD3+ or CD8+ cell in direct contact by at least one dimension with a tumor cell, were manually quantified by a pathologist (PrB). The number of CD8+ TILs was normalized by tissue area in μm2 calculated by QuPath. For analysis of GATA6 and CK5 expression, tumor epithelium was manually annotated by a pathologist (SF). The Cell Detection tool followed by cell-based quantification then yielded the number of negative, and weakly, moderately, and strongly positive cells.
SHG images were captured from unstained, uncovered TMA slides. Cores were imaged at the Advanced Optical Microscopy Facility (AOMF, UHN, Toronto) for 2 channel SHG and autofluorescence using 20x water immersion lens. Following a 1-hour laser warm-up period, a Chameleon Discovery (Coherent) femtosecond multiphoton laser was used to emit an excitation wavelength of 840 nm onto tissue. Light was collected in the backward direction using a narrow band pass filter of 415-424 nm, capturing the SHG signal at 420 nm, half excitation wavelength. Emission was collected using a 20x water immersion objective (W Plan-Apochromat NA = 1.0). To increase uniformity of illumination across the field of view, images were acquired at zoom 2.0, generating 512x512 pixel images that were tiled to create a final image of 5120x5120 pixels (ZEN Black, ZEISS). Autofluorescence was detected at 463-617 nm and was used to provide context to the SHG image generated. SHG images were normalized via a user-defined macro for Fiji (ImageJ). Briefly, raw SHG .czi files were imported into Fiji using Bio-Format importer. Images were split into SHG and autofluorescence channels. SHG channel images were normalized to the brightest pixel in the image using Enhance Contrast, Saturated = 0.35. Images were then smoothened using a Gaussian Blur, sigma = 1. In order to remove background pixels, a Huang dark auto-threshold was applied to select only pixels positive for SHG signal. Normalized SHG images were saved as 16-bit .TIFF files. Cores with less than 25% area were omitted from further analysis. Collagen fibers detected in normalized images were quantified for alignment, straightness, width, and length, using CT-FIRE ( https://loci.wisc.edu/software/ctfire ) in batch-mode with parallel processing using default settings.
CAFs were trypsinised and washed extensively in PBS to remove residual FBS. CAFs were spun down, resuspended in serum-free growth medium (DMEM/F12, GlutaMAX, HEPES, Anti/Anti), and counted with a Haematocytometer. 30,000 viable CAFs cells were seeded in triplicates into 8 μm TransWell inserts, transferred to 24-well plates containing growth medium plus 10% FBS. Cells were left for 16 h to migrate through the TransWell membrane. Plates were then removed from the incubator and media was removed from inserts. A cotton tip was used to wipe the remaining cells and excess media from the top of the TransWell membranes. Transmigrate cells at the bottom of the membrane were fixed in −20°C MeOH for 10 minutes and left to dry. Inserts were then stained overnight in 0.2% Crystal Violet (w/v) in MeOH. Inserts were washed and dried. Images of full inserts were taken with an upright brightfield microscope and analyzed using the cell counter plugin of the ImageJ software. Data was averaged over 3-4 biological replicates and plotted ± standard error of means (SEM).
CAFs were seeded at 1x10 6 cells per 10-cm plate, washed 3x with PBS 8 h later, and 5 mL Advanced DMEM/F12 medium (GIBCO) was added per plate. 48 h later, conditioned media was collected, pooled, passed through 0.22 μm syringe-top filters, spun down, snap frozen and stored at −80°C. “CAF conditioned PDO media” were prepared using this CAF-conditioned Advanced DMEM/F12 as base medium for standard PDO culture medium ( Boj et al., 2015 5. Boj, S.F. ∙ Hwang, C.-I. ∙ Baker, L.A. ... Organoid models of human and mouse ductal pancreatic cancer Cell. 2015; 160 :324-338 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1492) PubMed Google Scholar ). PDOs were kept in CAF conditioned PDO media for 2 passages prior to entering growth and drug response assays as well as during the assay periods.
CAF CM pre-educated PDOs were dissociated into single cells, counted and plated in 10% Matrigel slurries made up in CAF conditioned PDO media. PDOs were plated at 2,000 cells per well in 384-well plates 72 hours prior to all drug treatments. For single-agent Gemcitabine assays, cells were plated in triplicate for an 8-point dose response curve and treated with the respective Gemcitabine concentrations in a range from 1 - 0.0005 μM for 96 hours. For FFX and GnP combination drug assay, appropriate dose ranges for each drug were determined in single drug assays for all PDO models used. Cells were then plated in singlets for a 21-point dose response curve and treated with combinations of the respective drug concentrations for 96 h: Gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel were applied at a range of 1 μM - 0.0001 μM each; 5-FU plus Oxaliplatin plus SN-38 were applied at a range of 900 μM - 0.01 μM for both 5-FU and Oxaliplatin and 1 μM - 0.00003 μM for SN-38. ‘Untreated’ control cells plated in triplicates received vehicle alone (DMSO). Cell viability was determined by Celltiter Glo 3D assay according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Drug response curves were graphed using Graphpad Prism 6.0.
For CAF growth assays, 2,000 viable CAFs were seeded in 100 μl growth medium on 96-well plates in pentaplicates for a reference plate and five time points. For PDO growth assays, 2,000 viable CM-pre-educated PDO cells were plated in CAF conditioned PDO media on 384-well plates in pentaplicates. For all assay seeding, cell viability was determined by Trypan Blue exclusion on an automated Countess Cell Counter (Invitrogen). Viable cell counts were then manually confirmed using hematocytometers. At each assay time point for CAFs and PDOs, pre-aliquoted Cell TiterGlo 3D reagent was freshly thawed and equilibrated to room temperature for 15 minutes in the dark. Next, 1 volume of Cell TiterGlo reagent was added to the media in each well, the plate was covered, placed on a rotation shaker for 5 minutes at 120 rpm, and left at room temperature for an additional 25 minutes. Luminescence was read on a plate reader (Tecan) over 0.1 s. Data was normalized to the t = 12h reference plate and averaged over 3-4 biological replicates for each time point before plotting mean ± standard error of means (SEM).
Where appropriate, the quantitative analyses are described in the relevant sections of the Method details. Unless stated otherwise, bioinformatic and statistical analyses and plotting were performed using R (v3.5.1). Data were visualized using R packages ggplot2, ggpubr, gtools, reshape2, pheatmap, complexHeatmap, RColorBrewer, scales, corrplot, viridis, psych, openxlsx, dplyr. Qualitative variables were compared by Fisher exact test, and quantitative variables by Wilcoxon rank sum test for pairwise comparisons and the Kruskal–Wallis test for multiple group comparisons. Survival curves were plotted by the Kaplan–Meier method using the Survminer R package and p values were assessed based on logrank test. The specific statistical tests used are indicated in the figure legends. All tests were two-sided. Multiple test P values were adjusted using Benjamini and Hochberg method for independent tests or Benjamini and Yekutieli method for dependent tests, respectively. Correlation coefficients were determined by the Spearman method. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.
