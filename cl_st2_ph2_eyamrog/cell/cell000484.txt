Title: Revisiting astrocyte to neuron conversion with lineage tracing in vivo


Abstract: Summary

In vivo cell fate conversions have emerged as potential regeneration-based therapeutics for injury and disease. Recent studies reported that ectopic expression or knockdown of certain factors can convert resident astrocytes into functional neurons with high efficiency, region specificity, and precise connectivity. However, using stringent lineage tracing in the mouse brain, we show that the presumed astrocyte-converted neurons are actually endogenous neurons. AAV-mediated co-expression of NEUROD1 and a reporter specifically and efficiently induces reporter-labeled neurons. However, these neurons cannot be traced retrospectively to quiescent or reactive astrocytes using lineage-mapping strategies. Instead, through a retrograde labeling approach, our results reveal that endogenous neurons are the source for these viral-reporter-labeled neurons. Similarly, despite efficient knockdown of PTBP1 in vivo , genetically traced resident astrocytes were not converted into neurons. Together, our results highlight the requirement of lineage-tracing strategies, which should be broadly applied to studies of cell fate conversions in vivo .

Section: Introduction

Neural injury or degeneration often leads to neuron loss and impaired neurocircuits. Regeneration of neurons could constitute an ideal therapeutic strategy because they will be immunocompatible with the host. Except for a few neurogenic niches ( Zhao et al., 2008 55. Zhao, C. ∙ Deng, W. ∙ Gage, F.H. Mechanisms and functional implications of adult neurogenesis Cell. 2008; 132 :645-660 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2551) PubMed Google Scholar ), however, the adult mammalian brain or spinal cord lacks intrinsic capacity to produce new neurons.
In vivo conversion of resident glial cells to functional new neurons emerges as a promising strategy for neural regeneration ( Barker et al., 2018 2. Barker, R.A. ∙ Götz, M. ∙ Parmar, M.

This is largely accomplished by ectopic expression of a single or a combination of fate-determining factors or through knockdown of a single gene ( Grande et al., 2013 13.

Resident glial cells are ideal cell sources for fate conversions because they become reactive and can proliferate to replenish themselves in response to injury or degeneration.

Such results, if confirmed, will revolutionize regenerative medicine.

We noticed that endogenous neurons could have been misidentified as the glia converted if not verified by stringent lineage-tracing methods. In this study, we re-examined direct astrocyte-to-neuron (AtN) conversion by employing multiple lineage-tracing strategies. Our results do not support those phenomenal claims that resident astrocytes can be directly and efficiently converted into mature neurons.

Glia-to-neuron conversion by CRISPR-CasRx alleviates symptoms of neurological disease in mice Cell. 2020; 181 :590-603.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (287) PubMed Google Scholar ). To drive gene expression, we used the synthetic 681-bp gfaABC1D human GFAP promoter ( hGFAP ) ( Lee et al., 2008 19. Lee, Y. ∙ Messing, A. ∙ Su, M. ... GFAP promoter elements required for region-specific and astrocyte-specific expression Glia. 2008; 56 :481-493 Crossref Scopus (258) PubMed Google Scholar ), which exhibits astrocyte-restricted activity as the 2.2-kb gfa2 promoter. Cell type specificity was examined by the GFP reporter after intracerebral AAV injections. When examined at 4 days post-virus injection (dpv), GFP was predominantly detected in GFAP + cortical astrocytes for most of these AAVs ( Figures S1 A–S1C; 97.0% ± 1.2% for AAV2, 92.1% ± 1.4% for AAV5, 97.6% ± 1.2% for AAV8, and 94.1% ± 0.9% for AAV9). The number of GFP + neurons was minimal ( Figures S1 A–S1C). However, cell type specificity was dramatically different at 14 dpv ( Figures S1 C–S1E). Only 62.4% ± 8.0% and 69.2% ± 8.0% of the virus-transduced cells were GFAP + astrocytes for AAV8 and AAV9, respectively, whereas the neuronal fractions were correspondingly increased. Furthermore, both AAV8 and AAV9 showed spatial preferences with predominant neurons or astrocytes in different cortical regions ( Figure S1 E). AAV.PHP.eB, on the other hand, showed a similar targeting efficiency for neurons (34.7% ± 1.5% at 4 dpv and 51.8% ± 1.7% at 14 dpv) and astrocytes (64.8% ± 1.4% for 4 dpv and 47.9% ± 1.6% for 14 dpv; Figures S1 B, S1C, and S1E). In contrast, the cell type specificity of AAV2 and AAV5 remained rather stable with 98.6% ± 1.3% and 90.4% ± 8.0% of the GFP reporter in astrocytes, respectively ( Figures S1 B–S1D). Because AAV2 infected fewer cells when compared to AAV5 with the same virus titer, AAV5 was selected for most of the subsequent experiments.
We injected hGFAP-mCherry ( mCh ) or hGFAP-NEUROD1-T2A-mCherry ( ND1-mCh ) AAV5 virus into the adult mouse cortex ( Figure 1 A). At 4 dpv, the reporter mCherry was highly restricted to GFAP + astrocytes ( Figures 1 B and 1C; 99.9% ± 0.1% for mCh and 96.4% ± 3.6% for ND1-mCh ). Remarkably, at 17 dpv, 79.8% ± 4.4% of mCherry + cells were NeuN + neurons in the cortex injected with the ND1-mCh virus ( Figures 1 B and 1C). This was in sharp contrast to the control mCh virus-injected mice, in which 87.7% ± 5.0% of mCherry + cells were still astrocytes. Such a result was largely consistent with what was reported on NEUROD1 ( Chen et al., 2020 7. Chen, Y.C. ∙ Ma, N.X. ∙ Pei, Z.F. ... A NeuroD1 AAV-based gene therapy for functional brain repair after ischemic injury through in vivo astrocyte-to-neuron conversion Mol. Ther. 2020; 28 :217-234 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (159) PubMed Google Scholar ; Liu et al., 2020 23. Liu, M.H. ∙ Li, W. ∙ Zheng, J.J. ... Differential neuronal reprogramming induced by NeuroD1 from astrocytes in grey matter versus white matter Neural Regen. Res. 2020; 15 :342-351 Crossref Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wu et al., 2020 51. Wu, Z. ∙ Parry, M. ∙ Hou, X.Y. ... Gene therapy conversion of striatal astrocytes into GABAergic neurons in mouse models of Huntington’s disease Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :1105 Crossref Scopus (120) PubMed Google Scholar ). Notwithstanding such abundant mCherry + neurons in the ND1-mCh group, we failed to observe significant changes on the density of either neurons or astrocytes in the virus-injected cortex ( Figure 1 D). However, it should be noted that proliferative astrocytes might have replenished those lost. On the other hand, a time-course analysis of the ND1-mCh virus-injected brains failed to show cells expressing doublecortin (DCX) ( Figures 1 E and 1F), a well-established marker for immature neurons ( Couillard-Despres et al., 2005 8. Couillard-Despres, S. ∙ Winner, B. ∙ Schaubeck, S. ... Doublecortin expression levels in adult brain reflect neurogenesis Eur. J. Neurosci. 2005; 21 :1-14 Crossref Scopus (825) PubMed Google Scholar ). Together, these results indicate that, despite robust induction of reporter-positive neurons by ND1-mCh , these neurons do not pass through an immature stage and do not lead to an overall increase of neuronal density in the virus-injected brain areas.
A therapeutic promise for in vivo reprogramming is to convert reactive astrocytes into neurons under pathological conditions. We subjected adult mice to brain injury through controlled cortical impact (CCI) ( Chen et al., 2019 6. Chen, C. ∙ Zhong, X. ∙ Smith, D.K. ... Astrocyte-specific deletion of Sox2 promotes functional recovery after traumatic brain injury Cereb. Cortex. 2019; 29 :54-69 Crossref Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ). Immediately following CCI, these mice were continuously administered with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) in drinking water to label proliferating cells, including reactive astrocytes. 7 days later, we injected either mCh or ND1-mCh virus into the penumbra of the injured cortex and performed analyses at 17 dpv ( Figure 1 G). Over 72% of GFAP + cells were BrdU + , indicating robust labeling of reactive astrocytes ( Figures 1 H and 1I). Under this injury condition, 74.0% ± 3.9% of mCherry + cells in the ND1-mCh group were NeuN + , comparing to 2.3% ± 1.7% in the control mCh group ( Figures 1 J and 1L). However, only 2.0% ± 1.5% of mCherry + cells were BrdU + NeuN + in the ND1-mCh group ( Figures 1 J and 1L), indicating a very low BrdU-labeling efficiency. Of note, many of these BrdU + NeuN + cells exhibited a glia-like morphology with small nuclei, implicating induction of NeuN expression in glial cells ( Figure 1 L). Despite such a high ratio of mCherry + cells being NeuN + in the ND1-mCh group, we failed to observe a significant increase of neuronal density surrounding the injury penumbra ( Figure 1 K). These results indicate that reactive astrocytes do not contribute to NEUROD1-induced mCherry + neurons.
To follow the fate of astrocytes, we employed the tamoxifen-inducible Aldh1l1-CreER T2 mouse ( Srinivasan et al., 2016 38. Srinivasan, R. ∙ Lu, T.Y. ∙ Chai, H. ... New transgenic mouse lines for selectively targeting astrocytes and studying calcium signals in astrocyte processes in situ and in vivo Neuron. 2016; 92 :1181-1195 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (274) PubMed Google Scholar ). We confirmed cell type specificity and labeling efficiency by crossing this line to the R26R-YFP reporter ( Figure S2 A). After tamoxifen treatments, 95.7% ± 2.6% and 99.9% ± 0% of YFP + cells expressed the astrocyte marker ALDH1L1 and ALDOC, respectively ( Figures S2 B–S2E). Only 4.3% ± 2.6% of YFP + cells were NeuN + ( Srinivasan et al., 2016 38. Srinivasan, R. ∙ Lu, T.Y. ∙ Chai, H. ... New transgenic mouse lines for selectively targeting astrocytes and studying calcium signals in astrocyte processes in situ and in vivo Neuron. 2016; 92 :1181-1195 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (274) PubMed Google Scholar ). Conversely, 96.5% ± 1.8% of ALDH1L1 + cells and 94.1% ± 2.2% of ALDOC + cells could be traced by YFP ( Figures S2 C–S2E), showing highly efficient tracing of resident astrocytes.
We then injected either mCh or ND1-mCh AAV5 virus into the cortex of tamoxifen-treated adult Aldh1l1-CreER T2 ;R26R-YFP mouse ( Figure 2 A). At 17 dpv, 73.3% ± 8.9% of mCherry + cells were NeuN + neurons in the ND1-mCh group ( Figures 2 B and 2C), consistent with the results in wild-type mice ( Figures 1 B and 1C). However, these mCherry + NeuN + cells were not labeled with YFP, indicating a non-astrocyte origin ( Figure 2 C).
As controls, we also examined AtN conversion in adult Aldh1l1-CreER T2 ;R26R-tdTomato mice ( Xiang et al., 2021 52. Xiang, Z. ∙ Xu, L. ∙ Liu, M. ... Lineage tracing of direct astrocyte-to-neuron conversion in the mouse cortex Neural Regen. Res. 2021; 16 :750-756 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ). Tamoxifen treatments induced efficient labeling of resident astrocytes by tdTomato ( Figures S2 J–S2N). Nonetheless, it should be noted that, in rare cases, endogenous neurons could also be traced in various brain regions ( Figures S2 O and S2P). These rare mice could be excluded by examining tdTomato + neurons in regions that were not virus injected during immunohistological analyses. Tamoxifen-treated Aldh1l1-CreER T2 ;R26R-tdTomato mice were intracerebrally injected with hGFAP-GFP ( GFP ) or hGFAP-GFP-T2A-NEUROD1 ( GFP-ND1 ) virus ( Figure 2 D). At 90 dpv, GFP + cells were predominantly NeuN + neurons in the GFP-ND1 group (81.0% ± 5.2% for GFP-ND1 versus 13.4% ± 3.8% for GFP control; Figures 2 E and 2F). However, these GFP + NeuN + neurons were not traced with tdTomato, indicating a non-astrocyte origin ( Figures 2 E and 2F).
The environmental milieu may account for the failure of detecting AtN conversion by NEUROD1 in Aldh1l1-CreER T2 ;R26R-YFP mice, because injury may precondition resident glial cells for fate reprogramming ( Grande et al., 2013 13. Grande, A. ∙ Sumiyoshi, K. ∙ López-Juárez, A. ... Environmental impact on direct neuronal reprogramming in vivo in the adult brain Nat. Commun. 2013; 4 :2373 Crossref Scopus (173) PubMed Google Scholar ; Heinrich et al., 2014 16. Heinrich, C. ∙ Bergami, M. ∙ Gascón, S. ... Sox2-mediated conversion of NG2 glia into induced neurons in the injured adult cerebral cortex Stem Cell Reports. 2014; 3 :1000-1014 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (239) PubMed Google Scholar ). We examined this possibility by subjecting tamoxifen-treated tracing mice to CCI, followed by injections of either mCh or ND1-mCh virus near the injury penumbra ( Figure 2 G). mCherry + NeuN + cells could be efficiently induced in the ND1-mCh group ( Figures 2 H and 2I; 64.9% ± 7.2% for ND1-mCh versus 18.5% ± 5.4% for mCh ); however, very few of them were YFP + ( Figures 2 H and 2I; 1.4% ± 1.4% for ND1-mCh ). These mCherry + NeuN + YFP + cells might be a result of variable labeling background, because 4.3% ± 2.6% of endogenous neurons could be genetically traced in Aldh1l1-CreER T2 mice ( Srinivasan et al., 2016 38. Srinivasan, R. ∙ Lu, T.Y. ∙ Chai, H. ...

The AAV-based Cre-FLEX system was previously used for AtN conversion ( Chen et al., 2020 7. Chen, Y.C. ∙ Ma, N.X. ∙ Pei, Z.F. ... A NeuroD1 AAV-based gene therapy for functional brain repair after ischemic injury through in vivo astrocyte-to-neuron conversion Mol. Ther. 2020; 28 :217-234 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (159) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wu et al., 2020 51. Wu, Z. ∙ Parry, M. ∙ Hou, X.Y. ... Gene therapy conversion of striatal astrocytes into GABAergic neurons in mouse models of Huntington’s disease Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :1105 Crossref Scopus (120) PubMed Google Scholar ). It employed two AAV vectors ( Figures 3 A and S3 A). One used hGFAP-Cre to target astrocytes ( Figure S3 A), and the other, CAG-FLEX-mCherry ( F-mCh ) or CAG-FLEX-NEUROD1-T2A-mCherry ( F-ND1-mCh ), expressed the genes in a Cre-dependent manner under the constitutively active CAG promoter ( Figure 3 A). We examined cell type specificity of the hGFAP-Cre with the commonly used serotypes. When examined at 4 or 14 dpv, both AAV8 and AAV9 serotypes showed Cre expression in NeuN + neurons ( Figures S3 C–S3E). The AAV5-hGFAP-Cre showed astrocyte-restricted expression at 4 dpv; however, neurons became the predominant cell type at 14 dpv ( Figures S3 C–S3E). We also examined AAV5.GFAP.Cre.WPRE.hGH (referred as AAV5-hGFAP ∗ -Cre ), in which Cre was driven by the 2.2-kb gfa2 hGFAP promoter ( Figure S3 B). It showed a similar pattern with astrocytes and neurons as the predominant cells at 4 and 14 dpv, respectively ( Figures S3 C–S3E). Despite these results, we co-injected hGFAP-Cre with either F-mCh or F-ND1-mCh AAV5 virus into the adult cortex. mCherry + neurons were observed at 17 dpv in all groups, though the F-ND1-mCh group showed less within-group variations ( Figures S3 F–S3H; 88.6% ± 3.5% for F-ND1-mCh versus 61.8% ± 12.0% for F-mCh ). Thus, these results indicate that the dual AAV-based Cre-FLEX system lacks the required cell type specificity to trace AtN conversions.
To restrict NEUROD1 in astrocytes, we employed the tamoxifen-inducible Aldh1l1-CreER T2 mice. They were injected with F-mCh or F-ND1-mCh AAV5 virus, treated with tamoxifen, and analyzed at 17 dpv ( Figures 3 A and 3B). Immunostaining showed robust NEUROD1 expression in the F-ND1-mCh group ( Figures 3 C and 3D). Unexpectedly, the reporter mCherry was mainly detected in GFAP + astrocytes ( Figures 3 E and 3F; 92.8% ± 6.1% for F-ND1-mCh versus 87.8% ± 6.4% for F-mCh ), indicating that mCherry + neurons cannot be rapidly induced by NEUROD1 when its expression is restricted to adult astrocytes.
To examine whether injury might facilitate astrocyte-restricted NEUROD1 to induce AtN conversion, adult Aldh1l1-CreER T2 ;R26R-YFP mice were subjected to CCI, injected with F-mCh or F-ND1-mCh virus, and treated with tamoxifen ( Figure 3 G). A few mCherry + NeuN + cells were detected at 28 dpv in both groups, and none of them were YFP + ( Figures 3 H and 3I). Neuronal density was also similar between groups ( Figure 3 J). These results indicate that astrocyte-restricted NEUROD1 is incapable of inducing AtN conversion even after brain injury.
To determine whether a longer time was required for NEUROD1 to induce AtN conversion, adult Aldh1l1-CreER T2 ;R26R-YFP mice were injected with virus, treated with tamoxifen, and examined at 98 dpv ( Figures S4 A and S4B). mCherry + cells in the control F-mCh group were largely NeuN − ( Figure S4 C). Interestingly, the phenotypes of mCherry + cells in the F-ND1-mCh group were variable: in some areas, they were predominantly NeuN − , whereas in other areas, they were largely NeuN + ( Figure S4 C). Notwithstanding, these mCherry + NeuN + cells were not traced with YFP, indicating a non-astrocyte origin.
An alternative explanation for these above results was that tamoxifen might have abolished the reprogramming ability of NEUROD1. However, this was unlikely the case. As shown in Figure 2 , tamoxifen treatment prior to virus injection had no effect on the induction of mCherry + neurons by NEUROD1 in Aldh1l1-CreER T2 ;R26R-YFP mice, although these neurons were not traced with YFP ( Figures 2 A–2C and 2G–2I). We also examined a delayed treatment scheme, in which tamoxifen was administered following the virus injections ( Figure 3 K). 92.0% ± 1.1% of mCherry + cells were NeuN + neurons at 28 dpv in mice injected with the ND1-mCh AAV5 virus; nonetheless, only a low background level of YFP + neurons was observed ( Figures 3 L and 3M). Together, these results show that neither tamoxifen-treatment nor the transgenic mouse background blocks the ability of NEUROD1 to induce mCherry + NeuN + neurons.
A recent study showed that co-expression of NEUROD1 and DLX2 can efficiently convert astrocytes into local neurons in the adult mouse striatum ( Wu et al., 2020 51. Wu, Z. ∙ Parry, M. ∙ Hou, X.Y. ... Gene therapy conversion of striatal astrocytes into GABAergic neurons in mouse models of Huntington’s disease Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :1105 Crossref Scopus (120) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting that the reprogramming ability of NEUROD1 might be enhanced by DLX2. To test such a possibility, we injected the Cre-dependent F-mCh AAV5 virus or a combination of F-ND1-mCh and CAG-FLEX-HA-DLX2-mCh ( F-ND1/DLX2-mCh ) into the striatum of adult Aldh1l1-CreER T2 ;R26R-YFP mouse. These mice were then treated with tamoxifen at 4 dpv and examined at 60 dpv ( Figure 4 B). A larger number of mCherry + NeuN + neurons was indeed observed in the F-ND1/DLX2-mCh group (38.3% ± 2.7% for F-ND1/DLX2-mCh versus 2.7% ± 1.2% for F-mCh ; Figures 4 C and 4D); however, they were not traced with YFP, indicating a non-astrocyte origin.
To verify these above results, we also employed mGfap-Cre;R26R-YFP mice ( Gregorian et al., 2009 14. Gregorian, C. ∙ Nakashima, J. ∙ Le Belle, J. ... Pten deletion in adult neural stem/progenitor cells enhances constitutive neurogenesis J. Neurosci. 2009; 29 :1874-1886 Crossref Scopus (216) PubMed Google Scholar ). Under normal condition, YFP + NeuN + neurons were observed in various brain regions, including the cortex and midbrain ( Figures S5 A and S5B). In contrast, striatal astrocytes were specifically and highly efficiently traced with the reporter YFP ( Figures S5 C–S5F). 95.8% ± 1.2% and 95.9% ± 1.5% of YFP + cells were ALDH1L1 + and ALDOC + astrocytes, respectively ( Figures S5 D and S5E). Conversely, 88.5% ± 3.9% of ALDH1L1 + and 87.0% ± 4.1% of ALDOC + striatal astrocytes were traced with YFP, indicating highly efficient labeling ( Figures S5 D and S5F). We then injected F-mCh or F-ND1/DLX2-mCh AAV5 viruses into the striatum of mGfap-Cre;R26R-YFP mouse ( Figure 4 E). mCherry + NeuN + neurons were observed at 60 dpv in the F-ND1/DLX2-mCh group (35.7% ± 2.4% for F-ND1/DLX2-mCh versus 1.7% ± 0.9% for F-mCh ; Figures 4 F and 4G). Once again, however, these neurons were not traced with YFP. The co-expression of Cre-dependent NEUROD1 and DLX2 (indicated by the hemagglutinin [HA] tag) was verified ( Figures 4 H–4J). Together, these above results clearly show that a combination of NEUROD1 and DLX2 fails to convert striatal astrocytes into neurons.
Our results with genetic lineage tracing and BrdU labeling show that resident astrocytes, reactive or quiescent, are not a cell source for NEUROD1-induced mCherry + neurons. We finally examined whether they were actually endogenous neurons. We first labeled cortical neurons through the rAAV2-retro virus, an engineered AAV2 variant enabling retrograde access to projection neurons ( Tervo et al., 2016 44. Tervo, D.G. ∙ Hwang, B.Y. ∙ Viswanathan, S. ... A designer AAV variant permits efficient retrograde access to projection neurons Neuron. 2016; 92 :372-382 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (808) PubMed Google Scholar ). We injected the rAAV2-retro-CAG-GFP ( Retro-GFP ) virus to target the cortical spinal tract (CST) at the 6 th thoracic spinal cord level (T6) ( Figure 5 A). When examined at 10 or 28 dpv ( Figure 5 A), a group of cortical motor neurons were retrogradely labeled with GFP ( Figures 5 B and 5C). Importantly, GFP was not detected in any of the ALDH1L1 + or GFAP + cortical astrocytes ( Figure 5 D), showing stringent cell type specificity of the retrograde-labeling method. Adult wild-type mice were then first injected with the Retro-GFP virus into the T6 CST, followed by cortical injections of mCh or ND1-mCh AAV5 virus ( Figure 5 E). Many mCherry + neurons were detected at 17 dpv in the ND1-mCh group ( Figures 5 F and 5G). Of these, 37.3% ± 4.3% were also GFP + surrounding the AAV5-injected cortex ( Figure 5 H). This number was a huge underestimate of the contribution of endogenous neurons to NEUROD1-induced mCherry + NeuN + cells, because only a fraction of endogenous motor neurons was traced by the retrograde GFP reporter. Together, these results show that endogenous neurons are the cell source for NEUROD1-induced mCherry + neurons.
Our results indicate that the cell type specificity of AAV5 virus under the hGFAP promoter can be altered by the downstream NEUROD1. To determine how broadly applicable this phenomenon was, we examined additional factors, including PAX6, NEUROG2, ASCL1, SOX2, OCT4, KLF4, MYC, and BDNF. They were individually cloned into the pAAV-hGFAP-xxx-T2A-mCherry vector and packaged into AAV5 virus. As shown in Figure 5 E, adult mice were first injected with the Retro-GFP virus into the T6 CST, followed by intracerebral injections of hGFAP-xxx-T2A-mCherry AAV5 virus into the motor cortex. At 17 dpv, we observed 90.7% ± 3.6% and 76.2% ± 1.9% of mCherry + neurons in brains injected with PAX6 and MYC viruses, respectively ( Figures 5 I and 5K). ASCL1 and NEUROG2 also induced approximately 52.7% ± 5.4% and 27.3% ± 8.5% of mCherry + neurons ( Figures 5 I and 5K). Importantly, many of these mCherry + neurons were also labeled with GFP, indicating an origin of endogenous neurons ( Figures 5 I and 5K). In contrast, only a background level of mCherry + neurons was observed in brains injected with virus expressing SOX2, OCT4, KLF4, or BDNF ( Figures 5 J and 5K). These results indicate that the cell type specificity of AAV5 virus under the hGFAP promoter can be selectively altered by the downstream factors.
How NEUROD1 induces reporter expression in endogenous neurons? One possibility is that NEUROD1 broadly changes the specificity of hGFAP promoter. We examined this through virus co-injections. We mixed and co-injected hGFAP-GFP AAV5 virus ( GFP ) with mCh or ND1-mCh AAV5 virus ( Figures 6 A and 6B). If NEUROD1 ectopic expression can broadly upregulate hGFAP promoter, GFP expression from the co-injected hGFAP-GFP virus should accumulate in neurons. As previously shown, many mCherry + neurons were specifically observed in the ND1-mCh group at 17 dpv ( Figures 6 C and 6D). Unexpectedly, GFP + neurons were rarely observed in brains co-injected with either mCh or ND1-mCh virus ( Figures 6 C and 6D), suggesting that NEUROD1 might modulate in cis the specificity of hGFAP promoter.
Alternatively, the AAV5 serotype could be altered by NEUROD1 expression during virus packaging, such that the ND1-mCh AAV5 virus was prone to infecting neurons when compared to the control mCh AAV5 virus. To examine this possibility, we co-transfected an equal amount of AAV-hGFAP-GFP plasmid with either AAV-hGFAP-mCherry or AAV-hGFAP-ND1-mCherry plasmid during AAV5 packaging ( Figure 6 E). If NEUROD1 expression somehow altered viral capsid during production, the co-packaged hGFAP-GFP should be similarly impacted. These co-packaged AAV5 viruses ( GFP/mCh or GFP/ND1-mCh ) were then injected into the brains of adult mice and examined at 17 dpv. Again, GFP expression was rarely detected in neurons in both groups, unlike mCherry, which was predominantly in neurons in the GFP/ND1-mCh group ( Figures 6 F and 6G). Together, these results indicate that NEUROD1 likely cis -regulates the specificity of hGFAP promoter for its expression in neurons.
To further examine the molecular mechanism, we made a few NEUROD1 mutants ( Figure 6 H). The point mutations, R111L and K139D, were made in the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domain to abolish DNA binding ( Malecki et al., 1999 26. Malecki, M.T. ∙ Jhala, U.S. ∙ Antonellis, A. ... Mutations in NEUROD1 are associated with the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus Nat. Genet. 1999; 23 :323-328 Crossref Scopus (537) PubMed Google Scholar ; Voronova and Baltimore, 1990 46. Voronova, A. ∙ Baltimore, D. Mutations that disrupt DNA binding and dimer formation in the E47 helix-loop-helix protein map to distinct domains Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1990; 87 :4722-4726 Crossref Scopus (281) PubMed Google Scholar ). NEUROD1 and its point mutants were cloned into the lentiviral CSC-IRES-GFP vector, and their neurogenic activity was then determined in human U251 cells ( Figures 6 I and 6J), as previously described ( Liu et al., 2013 20. Liu, M.L. ∙ Zang, T. ∙ Zou, Y. ... Small molecules enable neurogenin 2 to efficiently convert human fibroblasts into cholinergic neurons Nat. Commun. 2013; 4 :2183 Crossref Scopus (278) PubMed Google Scholar ; Su et al., 2014b 41. Su, Z. ∙ Zang, T. ∙ Liu, M.L. ... Reprogramming the fate of human glioma cells to impede brain tumor development Cell Death Dis. 2014; 5 :e1463 Crossref Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2021 50. Wang, X. ∙ Pei, Z. ∙ Hossain, A. ... Transcription factor-based gene therapy to treat glioblastoma through direct neuronal conversion Cancer Biol. Med. 2021; Published online March 23, 2021 Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar ). As expected, wild-type NEUROD1 efficiently induced U251 cells to become DCX + or microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) + neurons by 21 dpv, whereas the point mutants lost such neurogenic activity ( Figure 6 J). Of note, the K139D mutant behaved like a dominant negative because it blocked basal neuronal induction observed in the GFP control. We then cloned all NEUROD1 mutants into the pAAV-hGFAP-xxx-T2A-mCherry vector and packaged them into AAV5 virus. These viruses were individually injected into the adult cortex and examined at 17 dpv. Whereas the truncation mutants showed a variable ratio of mCherry expression in NeuN + neurons, NEUROD1 and its point mutants induced many mCherry + NeuN + neurons (76.2% ± 5.5% for ND1, 82.2% ± 4.5% for ND1-R111L, and 84.2% ± 5.4% for ND1-K139D; Figures 6 K and 6L). These results indicate that efficient induction of mCherry + neurons by NEUROD1 does not require its neurogenic activity.
Our above results show that resident astrocytes cannot be converted to neurons by NEUROD1. How about the other factors? We examined PTBP1 because its downregulation was reported to efficiently convert striatal astrocytes into either dopaminergic ( Zhou et al., 2020 56. Zhou, H. ∙ Su, J. ∙ Hu, X. ... Glia-to-neuron conversion by CRISPR-CasRx alleviates symptoms of neurological disease in mice Cell. 2020; 181 :590-603.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (287) PubMed Google Scholar ) or striatal neurons ( Qian et al., 2020 35. Qian, H. ∙ Kang, X. ∙ Hu, J. ... Reversing a model of Parkinson’s disease with in situ converted nigral neurons Nature. 2020; 582 :550-556 Crossref Scopus (296) PubMed Google Scholar ). We first employed the CRISPR-CasRx system ( Zhou et al., 2020 56. Zhou, H. ∙ Su, J. ∙ Hu, X. ... Glia-to-neuron conversion by CRISPR-CasRx alleviates symptoms of neurological disease in mice Cell. 2020; 181 :590-603.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (287) PubMed Google Scholar ). AAV-GFAP-CasRx or AAV-GFAP-CasRx-Ptbp1 was packaged with PHP.eB serotype, mixed with hGFAP-mCherry AAV5 virus, and injected into the adult mouse striatum ( Figures S6 A and S6B). Instead of using wild-type mice, we used mGfap-Cre;R26R-YFP mice such that striatal astrocytes could be lineage traced. At 60 dpv, 22.7% ± 3.2% of mCherry + cells were NeuN + in the CasRx-Ptbp1 group; however, they were not traced with YFP, indicating a non-astrocyte origin ( Figures S6 C and S6D). We next examined PTBP1 expression by using an antibody that was verified by both western blots and immunostaining ( Qian et al., 2020 35. Qian, H. ∙ Kang, X. ∙ Hu, J. ... Reversing a model of Parkinson’s disease with in situ converted nigral neurons Nature. 2020; 582 :550-556 Crossref Scopus (296) PubMed Google Scholar ). Surprisingly, PTBP1 expression was only mildly reduced in cells infected with CasRx-Ptbp1 virus at 60 dpv ( Figures S6 E–S6G). For this above analysis, the FLAG-tagged CasRx was indicated by the co-expressed mCherry reporter due to the incompatibility of FLAG antibody and PTBP1 antibody for co-staining. On the other hand, co-staining of mCherry and FLAG-tagged CasRx showed that over 95% of mCherry + cells were also FLAG + ( Figures S6 H and S6I), indicating that mCherry could be used as a valid indicator for CasRx or CasRx-Ptbp1 virus-transduced cells. Together, these results show that AAV-GFAP-CasRx-Ptbp1 neither efficiently downregulates PTBP1 nor converts striatal astrocytes in vivo , in sharp contrast to what was reported ( Zhou et al., 2020 56. Zhou, H. ∙ Su, J. ∙ Hu, X. ... Glia-to-neuron conversion by CRISPR-CasRx alleviates symptoms of neurological disease in mice Cell. 2020; 181 :590-603.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (287) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We then employed the short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-based approach ( Qian et al., 2020 35. Qian, H. ∙ Kang, X. ∙ Hu, J. ... Reversing a model of Parkinson’s disease with in situ converted nigral neurons Nature. 2020; 582 :550-556 Crossref Scopus (296) PubMed Google Scholar ). The reported Ptbp1 -targeting sequence was cloned into a miR30 -based vector to generate hGFAP-mCherry-shPtbp1 . A luciferase-targeting sequence ( shLuc ) was used as a control. Western blots showed that endogenous Ptbp1 was efficiently knocked down in cultured primary mouse brain astrocytes ( Figure S7 A). hGFAP-mCherry-shPtbp1 ( mCh-shPtbp1 ) or hGFAP-mCherry-shLuc ( mCh-shLuc ) AAV5 virus was then injected into the striatum of tamoxifen-treated young (postnatal day 35 [P35]–P40) Aldh1l1-CreER T2 ;R26R-YFP mouse ( Figure S7 B). PTBP1 expression was reduced to the background level when examined at 60 dpv ( Figures S7 C and S7D). Unexpectedly, only a small number of mCherry + cells were NeuN + (2.8% ± 0.9% for shPtbp1 versus 3.7% ± 1.7% for shLuc ; Figures S7 E and S7F). Furthermore, these mCherry + NeuN + neurons were not traced with YFP, indicating a non-astrocyte origin. To rule out a potential effect of mouse background or tamoxifen treatments, we injected mCh-shPtbp1 or mCh-shLuc virus into the striatum of young mGfap-Cre;R26R-YFP mouse ( Figure S7 G). The majority of mCherry + cells were NeuN − at 60 dpv ( Figures S7 H and S7I; 97.2% ± 0.7% for shLuc and 98.1% ± 1.5% for shPtbp1 ), indicating no AtN conversion by PTBP1 knockdown.
We also made the Cre-dependent AAV-CAG-LSL-mCherry-shPtbp1 and the control AAV-CAG-LSL-mCherry-shLuc AAV5 virus. Young Aldh1l1-CreER T2 ;R26R-YFP mice were injected with AAV5 virus into the striatum, treated with tamoxifen, and examined at 60 dpv ( Figure S7 J). A larger number of mCherry + NeuN + neurons were observed in the striatum injected with the shPtbp1 virus (31.1% ± 1.2% for shPtbp1 versus 6.7% ± 2.9% for shLuc ); however, they were not traced with YFP ( Figures S7 K and S7L). To verify such a result, we injected these above viruses into the striatum of young mGfap-Cre;R26R-YFP mouse ( Figure S7 M). Despite a relatively larger number of mCherry + NeuN + neurons being observed in the shPtbp1 group at 60 dpv (34.3% ± 1.9% for shPtbp1 versus 7.3% ± 1.5% for shLuc ), they were not traced with YFP, indicating a non-astrocyte origin ( Figures S7 N and S7O).
To further examine PTBP1 knockdown, we obtained AAV-CMV-LSL-RFP ( RFP ) and AAV-CMV-LSL-RFP-shPtbp1 ( RFP-shPtbp1 ) vectors ( Qian et al., 2020 35. Qian, H. ∙ Kang, X. ∙ Hu, J. ... Reversing a model of Parkinson’s disease with in situ converted nigral neurons Nature. 2020; 582 :550-556 Crossref Scopus (296) PubMed Google Scholar ) and packaged them into AAV5 virus. They were injected into the striatum of young mGfap-Cre;R26R-YFP mouse and examined at 60 dpv ( Figure 7 A). We confirmed efficient knockdown of endogenous PTBP1 ( Figures 7 B–7D). Despite RFP + NeuN + neurons being observed in the RFP-shPtbp1 group (32.1% ± 0.8% for RFP-shPtbp1 versus 7.8% ± 1.1% for RFP ), they were not traced with YFP ( Figures 7 E–7G). To rule out a potential effect of AAV serotype, we also packaged these vectors into AAV2 ( Qian et al., 2020 35. Qian, H. ∙ Kang, X. ∙ Hu, J. ... Reversing a model of Parkinson’s disease with in situ converted nigral neurons Nature. 2020; 582 :550-556 Crossref Scopus (296) PubMed Google Scholar ) and examined them in young mGfap-Cre;R26R-YFP mouse at 60 dpv ( Figure 7 H). Once again, YFP-traced RFP + NeuN + neurons were not observed ( Figures 7 I and 7J).
As a final attempt, we obtained the RFP and RFP-shPtbp1 AAV2 viruses ( Qian et al., 2020 35. Qian, H. ∙ Kang, X. ∙ Hu, J. ... Reversing a model of Parkinson’s disease with in situ converted nigral neurons Nature. 2020; 582 :550-556 Crossref Scopus (296) PubMed Google Scholar ) and injected them into the striatum of young mGfap-Cre;R26R-YFP mouse ( Figure 7 K). Again, YFP-traced RFP + NeuN + neurons were not detected at 60 dpv ( Figures 7 L and 7M). All together, these above results clearly indicate that, despite efficient knockdown of PTBP1, resident striatal astrocytes cannot be converted into neurons in vivo .

Section: Discussion

By employing multiple stringent lineage-tracing methods and examining many experimental conditions, our results do not support some of the recent extraordinary claims that resident astrocytes can be directly and efficiently converted into mature neurons with local identity and connectivity ( Chen et al., 2020 7.

Differential neuronal reprogramming induced by NeuroD1 from astrocytes in grey matter versus white matter Neural Regen. Res. 2020; 15 :342-351 Crossref Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ), our results indeed confirm that NEUROD1 can specifically, rapidly, and highly efficiently induce mCherry + neurons ( Chen et al., 2020 7. Chen, Y.C. ∙ Ma, N.X. ∙ Pei, Z.F. ... A NeuroD1 AAV-based gene therapy for functional brain repair after ischemic injury through in vivo astrocyte-to-neuron conversion Mol.

Differential neuronal reprogramming induced by NeuroD1 from astrocytes in grey matter versus white matter Neural Regen. Res. 2020; 15 :342-351 Crossref Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ). Nonetheless, these viral-reporter-positive neurons are not converted from resident astrocytes.
First, an immature stage is expected if astrocytes are converted into neurons. However, DCX, a well-established marker for immature neurons ( Couillard-Despres et al., 2005 8. Couillard-Despres, S. ∙ Winner, B. ∙ Schaubeck, S. ... Doublecortin expression levels in adult brain reflect neurogenesis Eur. J. Neurosci. 2005; 21 :1-14 Crossref Scopus (825) PubMed Google Scholar ), cannot be detected in any time points post-injection of NEUROD1 virus. Second, continuous BrdU labeling after brain injury fails to show a contribution of reactive glial cells to the mCherry + neurons. A caveat might be that BrdU is toxic to the newly converted neurons; however, this is unlikely because new neurons from reprogrammed glia can be robustly traced by such a BrdU labeling strategy ( Niu et al., 2013 29. Niu, W. ∙ Zang, T. ∙ Zou, Y. ... In vivo reprogramming of astrocytes to neuroblasts in the adult brain Nat. Cell Biol. 2013; 15 :1164-1175 Crossref Scopus (379) PubMed Google Scholar , 2015 30.

The p53 pathway controls SOX2-mediated reprogramming in the adult mouse spinal cord Cell Rep. 2016; 17 :891-903 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (81) PubMed Google Scholar ). Third, NEUROD1-induced mCherry + neurons cannot be traced by the astrocyte lineage reporter YFP, despite an approximate 95% YFP labeling efficiency. One might argue that tamoxifen treatments and the transgenic mouse background impede the reprogramming ability of NEUROD1; however, this is not the case because tamoxifen-independent NEUROD1 expression can induce numerous mCherry + neurons in tamoxifen-treated Aldh1l1-CreER T2 ;R26R-YFP mice. By switching the viral reporter to GFP and the lineage tracing reporter to tdTomato, we also fail to detect astrocytes-converted neurons in Aldh1l1-CreER T2 ;R26R-tdTomato mice at 90 dpv. Of note, some endogenous neurons could be labeled in variable brain regions of rare Aldh1l1-CreER T2 ;R26R-tdTomato mice, which might account for what was observed in a recent rebuttal article to our preprint ( Wang et al., 2020 49. Wang, L.-L. ∙ Garcia, C.S. ∙ Zhong, X. ... Rapid and efficient in vivo astrocyte-to-neuron conversion with regional identity and connectivity? bioRxiv. 2020; 2020.2008.2016.253195 Google Scholar ; Xiang et al., 2021 52. Xiang, Z. ∙ Xu, L. ∙ Liu, M. ... Lineage tracing of direct astrocyte-to-neuron conversion in the mouse cortex Neural Regen. Res. 2021; 16 :750-756 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ). Fourthly, brain injury fails to precondition genetically traced astrocytes to become neurons by NEUROD1. Because injury can promote fate reprogramming ( Grande et al., 2013 13. Grande, A. ∙ Sumiyoshi, K. ∙ López-Juárez, A. ... Environmental impact on direct neuronal reprogramming in vivo in the adult brain Nat. Commun. 2013; 4 :2373 Crossref Scopus (173) PubMed Google Scholar ; Guo et al., 2014 15. Guo, Z. ∙ Zhang, L. ∙ Wu, Z. ... In vivo direct reprogramming of reactive glial cells into functional neurons after brain injury and in an Alzheimer’s disease model Cell Stem Cell. 2014; 14 :188-202 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (604) PubMed Google Scholar ; Heinrich et al., 2014 16. Heinrich, C. ∙ Bergami, M. ∙ Gascón, S. ... Sox2-mediated conversion of NG2 glia into induced neurons in the injured adult cerebral cortex Stem Cell Reports. 2014; 3 :1000-1014 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (239) PubMed Google Scholar ), we examined such condition but failed to show AtN conversion. Fifthly, despite numerous mCherry + neurons, the overall neuronal density remains unchanged in the virus-injected regions, arguing against a net increase of neurons due to presumed robust AtN conversion. If any neurons were converted from astrocytes, the number would be extremely small, consistent with a previous report ( Brulet et al., 2017 4. Brulet, R. ∙ Matsuda, T. ∙ Zhang, L. ... NEUROD1 instructs neuronal conversion in non-reactive astrocytes Stem Cell Reports. 2017; 8 :1506-1515 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ). Sixthly, viral-reporter-positive neurons could still be induced by NEUROD1 mutants lacking any neurogenic activity, arguing against a potential function in cell fate conversion. And finally, retrograde labeling clearly reveals that endogenous neurons are the cell source for NEUROD1-induced reporter + neurons.
Our results, however, do not argue against a neurogenic activity of NEUROD1 under certain conditions, such as in cell culture or retrovirus-mediated expression after injury ( Guo et al., 2014 15. Guo, Z. ∙ Zhang, L. ∙ Wu, Z. ...

Small molecules efficiently reprogram human astroglial cells into functional neurons Cell Stem Cell. 2015; 17 :735-747 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (228) PubMed Google Scholar ). Regarding retrovirus-mediated conversion ( Guo et al., 2014 15. Guo, Z. ∙ Zhang, L. ∙ Wu, Z. ... In vivo direct reprogramming of reactive glial cells into functional neurons after brain injury and in an Alzheimer’s disease model Cell Stem Cell. 2014; 14 :188-202 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (604) PubMed Google Scholar ), nonetheless, the cell origin requires further delineation. Brain injury can induce migration of endogenous neural stem cells, which normally differentiate into astrocytes that are molecularly distinct from those in the local cortex ( Benner et al., 2013 3. Benner, E.J. ∙ Luciano, D. ∙ Jo, R. ... Protective astrogenesis from the SVZ niche after injury is controlled by Notch modulator Thbs4 Nature. 2013; 497 :369-373 Crossref Scopus (217) PubMed Google Scholar ). These migrating and differentiating neural stem cells, but not local cortical astrocytes, might well be the cell origin for the neurons that were induced by retroviral NEUROD1 ( Guo et al., 2014 15. Guo, Z. ∙ Zhang, L. ∙ Wu, Z. ... In vivo direct reprogramming of reactive glial cells into functional neurons after brain injury and in an Alzheimer’s disease model Cell Stem Cell. 2014; 14 :188-202 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (604) PubMed Google Scholar ). Such a possibility could have been excluded through genetic lineage tracing of endogenous neural stem cells, as we have previously shown ( Niu et al., 2013 29. Niu, W. ∙ Zang, T. ∙ Zou, Y. ... In vivo reprogramming of astrocytes to neuroblasts in the adult brain Nat. Cell Biol. 2013; 15 :1164-1175 Crossref Scopus (379) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tai et al., 2021 43. Tai, W. ∙ Wu, W. ∙ Wang, L.L. ... In vivo reprogramming of NG2 glia enables adult neurogenesis and functional recovery following spinal cord injury Cell Stem Cell. 2021; 28 :923-937.e4 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (93) PubMed Google Scholar ). Alternatively, local astrocytes could be genetically traced and examined for fate changes during the conversion process. Furthermore, retroviral infection could lead to fusion of microglia and endogenous neurons ( Ackman et al., 2006 1. Ackman, J.B. ∙ Siddiqi, F. ∙ Walikonis, R.S. ... Fusion of microglia with pyramidal neurons after retroviral infection J. Neurosci. 2006; 26 :11413-11422 Crossref Scopus (69) PubMed Google Scholar ), which might be the cell origin for the beautiful neurons observed in regions with retroviral NEUROD1 ( Xiang et al., 2021 52. Xiang, Z. ∙ Xu, L. ∙ Liu, M. ... Lineage tracing of direct astrocyte-to-neuron conversion in the mouse cortex Neural Regen. Res. 2021; 16 :750-756 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because of these above caveats, stringent lineage tracings are also essential even for retrovirus-mediated fate conversion ( Guo et al., 2014 15. Guo, Z. ∙ Zhang, L. ∙ Wu, Z. ... In vivo direct reprogramming of reactive glial cells into functional neurons after brain injury and in an Alzheimer’s disease model Cell Stem Cell. 2014; 14 :188-202 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (604) PubMed Google Scholar ; Xiang et al., 2021 52. Xiang, Z. ∙ Xu, L. ∙ Liu, M. ... Lineage tracing of direct astrocyte-to-neuron conversion in the mouse cortex Neural Regen. Res. 2021; 16 :750-756 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ).
An unresolved question is how NEUROD1 specifically induces reporter expression in endogenous neurons. Obviously, viral toxicity is not the underlying mechanism, as recently proposed ( Xiang et al., 2021 52. Xiang, Z. ∙ Xu, L. ∙ Liu, M. ... Lineage tracing of direct astrocyte-to-neuron conversion in the mouse cortex Neural Regen. Res. 2021; 16 :750-756 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ). First, if any virus induced cell toxicity, neurons would be more prone than astrocytes to toxicity-induced death, and therefore, the viral reporter would be more frequently detected in astrocytes, but not neurons. Second, viral-reporter-positive neurons are also observed in brain regions far away from the injection core, in which the virus concentration would be lower. Third, neuronal expression of the viral reporter is dependent on the factors expressed. The reporter is predominantly in astrocytes for the control virus (mCherry or GFP) and a few others (such as SOX2, OCT4, KLF4, and BDNF), whereas it is largely in neurons of brains injected with AAVs expressing NEUROD1, PAX6, ASCL1, or MYC. Viral toxicity would not confer such gene specificity. And fourthly, injection of mixed viruses or co-packaged viruses shows a clear separation of the viral reporter with expression in astrocytes for the control virus and in neurons for the NEUROD1 virus. Such a phenomenon could not be explained by viral toxicity. These latter results rather suggest that the hGFAP promoter might be cis -regulated by the downstream factors. This conclusion would be consistent with a prior observation that cell type specificity of the GFAP promoter can be altered by the expressed genes ( Su et al., 2004 39. Su, M. ∙ Hu, H. ∙ Lee, Y. ... Expression specificity of GFAP transgenes Neurochem. Res. 2004; 29 :2075-2093 Crossref Scopus (93) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because of the detection limits of the virus-expressed fluorescent reporters, however, we cannot exclude that NEUROD1 might also regulate in trans the co-injected hGFAP-Cre virus. The residual NEUROD1-induced Cre expression might form a positive feedforward loop with the AAV FLEX system to induce robust viral reporter expression in neurons ( Chen et al., 2020 7. Chen, Y.C. ∙ Ma, N.X. ∙ Pei, Z.F. ... A NeuroD1 AAV-based gene therapy for functional brain repair after ischemic injury through in vivo astrocyte-to-neuron conversion Mol. Ther. 2020; 28 :217-234 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (159) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wu et al., 2020 51. Wu, Z. ∙ Parry, M. ∙ Hou, X.Y. ... Gene therapy conversion of striatal astrocytes into GABAergic neurons in mouse models of Huntington’s disease Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :1105 Crossref Scopus (120) PubMed Google Scholar ; Xiang et al., 2021 52. Xiang, Z. ∙ Xu, L. ∙ Liu, M. ... Lineage tracing of direct astrocyte-to-neuron conversion in the mouse cortex Neural Regen. Res. 2021; 16 :750-756 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ). Regarding the AAV FLEX system, a recent report showed Cre-independent leaky expression in neurons ( Fischer et al., 2019 11. Fischer, K.B. ∙ Collins, H.K. ∙ Callaway, E.M. Sources of off-target expression from recombinase-dependent AAV vectors and mitigation with cross-over insensitive ATG-out vectors Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2019; Published online December 16, 2019 Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar ). Such leaky neuronal expression may be further exacerbated by the downstream genes, such as NEUROD1 and DLX2. Interestingly, AAVs can form circular concatamers through intermolecular recombination ( Yang et al., 1999 53. Yang, J. ∙ Zhou, W. ∙ Zhang, Y. ... Concatamerization of adeno-associated virus circular genomes occurs through intermolecular recombination J. Virol. 1999; 73 :9468-9477 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Through concatamerization, NEUROD1 may cooperate with the co-transduced AAVs to further increase reporter expression in neurons. Clearly, future studies are required to understand how the promoter in virus can be influenced by the downstream genes.
As another test case, our results also do not support the phenomenal claims that PTBP1 knockdown induces AtN conversion in vivo ( Qian et al., 2020 35. Qian, H. ∙ Kang, X. ∙ Hu, J. ... Reversing a model of Parkinson’s disease with in situ converted nigral neurons Nature. 2020; 582 :550-556 Crossref Scopus (296) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhou et al., 2020 56. Zhou, H. ∙ Su, J. ∙ Hu, X. ... Glia-to-neuron conversion by CRISPR-CasRx alleviates symptoms of neurological disease in mice Cell. 2020; 181 :590-603.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (287) PubMed Google Scholar ). It was extremely surprising that PTBP1 knockdown converts striatal astrocytes into either dopaminergic ( Zhou et al., 2020 56. Zhou, H. ∙ Su, J. ∙ Hu, X. ... Glia-to-neuron conversion by CRISPR-CasRx alleviates symptoms of neurological disease in mice Cell. 2020; 181 :590-603.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (287) PubMed Google Scholar ) or striatal neurons ( Qian et al., 2020 35. Qian, H. ∙ Kang, X. ∙ Hu, J. ... Reversing a model of Parkinson’s disease with in situ converted nigral neurons Nature. 2020; 582 :550-556 Crossref Scopus (296) PubMed Google Scholar ). By using the AAV-GFAP-CasRx-Ptbp1 virus ( Zhou et al., 2020 56. Zhou, H. ∙ Su, J. ∙ Hu, X. ... Glia-to-neuron conversion by CRISPR-CasRx alleviates symptoms of neurological disease in mice Cell. 2020; 181 :590-603.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (287) PubMed Google Scholar ), we not only failed to obtain neurons from genetically traced striatal astrocytes but also failed to detect efficient downregulation of PTBP1. Upon closer examination of the Zhou et al. report ( Zhou et al., 2020 56. Zhou, H. ∙ Su, J. ∙ Hu, X. ... Glia-to-neuron conversion by CRISPR-CasRx alleviates symptoms of neurological disease in mice Cell. 2020; 181 :590-603.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (287) PubMed Google Scholar ), the image quality is too poor to tell whether new striatal dopaminergic neurons were ever generated. Similarly, PTBP1 staining in the Zhou et al. report seems nonspecific, because endogenous PTBP1 should be mainly localized in the nucleus ( Qian et al., 2020 35. Qian, H. ∙ Kang, X. ∙ Hu, J. ... Reversing a model of Parkinson’s disease with in situ converted nigral neurons Nature. 2020; 582 :550-556 Crossref Scopus (296) PubMed Google Scholar ). On the other hand, we confirmed shRNA-mediated efficient knockdown of PTBP1 in vitro and in vivo . However, we failed to detect AtN conversion in two mouse lines ( Aldh1l1-CreER T2 ;R26R-YFP and mGfap-Cre;R26R-YFP ) and under several conditions: (1) AAV5 hGFAP-mCherry-shPtbp1 ; (2) AAV5 CAG-LSL-mCherry-shPtbp1 ; (3) AAV5 CMV-LSL-RFP-shPtbp1 ; (4) AAV2 CMV-LSL-RFP-shPtbp1 ; and (5) AAV2 CMV-LSL-RFP-shPtbp1 from Fu laboratory. Of note, a variable number of viral-reporter-labeled neurons could be detected under certain conditions, indicating leaky expression. The underlying cause is not clear for the discrepancies between our results and Fu lab’s, although young (P35–P40) mice were also used in our shPtbp1 study. One possibility is the mGfap-Cre line, which was reported to exhibit Cre expression in neural stem cells and in the male germline ( https://www.jax.org/strain/024098 ). As recommended, only hemizygous females were used for breeding in our study. Even under such a condition, we also noticed leaky reporter expression in neurons of multiple brain regions, including the cortex and midbrain.
Without in vivo AtN conversion as the cellular basis for function, how could mouse behaviors be improved under pathological conditions ( Chen et al., 2020 7. Chen, Y.C. ∙ Ma, N.X. ∙ Pei, Z.F. ... A NeuroD1 AAV-based gene therapy for functional brain repair after ischemic injury through in vivo astrocyte-to-neuron conversion Mol.

Reversing a model of Parkinson’s disease with in situ converted nigral neurons Nature. 2020; 582 :550-556 Crossref Scopus (296) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wu et al., 2020 51. Wu, Z. ∙ Parry, M. ∙ Hou, X.Y. ... Gene therapy conversion of striatal astrocytes into GABAergic neurons in mouse models of Huntington’s disease Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :1105 Crossref Scopus (120) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhou et al., 2020 56. Zhou, H. ∙ Su, J. ∙ Hu, X. ... Glia-to-neuron conversion by CRISPR-CasRx alleviates symptoms of neurological disease in mice Cell. 2020; 181 :590-603.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (287) PubMed Google Scholar )? If those behavioral improvements could be independently reproduced, neuronal protection might be an underlying mechanism. NEUROD1 is known to be cell autonomously required for neuronal survival ( Gao et al., 2009 12. Gao, Z. ∙ Ure, K. ∙ Ables, J.L. ... Neurod1 is essential for the survival and maturation of adult-born neurons Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12 :1090-1092 Crossref Scopus (348) PubMed Google Scholar ; Jahan et al., 2010 18. Jahan, I. ∙ Kersigo, J. ∙ Pan, N. ... Neurod1 regulates survival and formation of connections in mouse ear and brain Cell Tissue Res. 2010; 341 :95-110 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar ), whereas PTBP1 might contribute to neuronal vulnerability by controlling tau exon 10 splicing ( Roussarie et al., 2020 36. Roussarie, J.P. ∙ Yao, V. ∙ Rodriguez-Rodriguez, P. ... Selective neuronal vulnerability in Alzheimer’s disease: a network-based analysis Neuron. 2020; 107 :821-835.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (93) PubMed Google Scholar ). Future experiments are needed to examine such scenarios.
In conclusion, our results show that virus-expressed reporters and Cre are prone to leakage and that stringent lineage-tracing strategies are indispensable when studying in vivo cell fate conversions. Unlike cultured cells, the fate of which can be directly observed, in vivo conversion occurs in a complex microenvironment often filled with endogenous neurons. It is crucial to use well-controlled lineage mappings to confirm the cell origin. For tracing the lineage of astrocytes, the tamoxifen-inducible Aldh1l1-CreER T2 ;R26R-YFP line seems superior with minimal labeling of endogenous neurons. The Aldh1l1-CreER T2 ;R26R-tdTomato line also is generally specific; however, some leaky expression of tdTomato in neurons of variable brain regions is observed in rare mice. These rare mice should be excluded by broadly examining brain regions not injected with the reprogramming factors. The constitutive mGfap-Cre;R26R-YFP line exhibits specific labeling of striatal astrocytes but leaky expression in multiple brain regions. Because AtN conversion should transit through an immature stage, these immature neurons can be identified by the marker DCX ( Couillard-Despres et al., 2005 8. Couillard-Despres, S. ∙ Winner, B. ∙ Schaubeck, S. ... Doublecortin expression levels in adult brain reflect neurogenesis Eur. J. Neurosci. 2005; 21 :1-14 Crossref Scopus (825) PubMed Google Scholar ). A promise of AtN conversion is to generate new neurons from disease-responsive reactive astrocytes. These reactive astrocytes can be pre-labeled with BrdU and examined for BrdU-traced neurons after AtN conversion. A superior method for examining AtN conversion is in vivo time-lapse imaging, as elegantly demonstrated for adult neurogenesis ( Pilz et al., 2018 34. Pilz, G.A. ∙ Bottes, S. ∙ Betizeau, M. ... Live imaging of neurogenesis in the adult mouse hippocampus Science. 2018; 359 :658-662 Crossref Scopus (225) PubMed Google Scholar ); however, such a method will be technically and costly prohibitive for most research labs. Single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) may be considered; nonetheless, the trajectory analysis should be cautiously interpreted because the reprogramming factors can indeed regulate a plethora of developmental genes. Overall, stringent genetic lineage tracings, pre-labeling of reactive cells with BrdU, and examination of immature neuronal stages can be readily conducted in most research labs and should be broadly applied in the studies of cell fate conversion in vivo .
Future experiments are needed to tease out the molecular mechanisms by which NEUROD1 or others alter the cell type specificity of the viral promoter. For example, NEUROD1 and PAX6 share no sequence similarity at either the DNA or protein levels, yet they both robustly induce the viral reporter in endogenous neurons. Truncation analyses of NEUROD1 also failed to identify a region responsible for the altered cell type specificity. Furthermore, it is not clear how NEUROD1 or others (alone or in combinations) exacerbate leaky neuronal expression of the AAV-based FLEX system ( Fischer et al., 2019 11. Fischer, K.B. ∙ Collins, H.K. ∙ Callaway, E.M. Sources of off-target expression from recombinase-dependent AAV vectors and mitigation with cross-over insensitive ATG-out vectors Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2019; Published online December 16, 2019 Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar ), although we suspect that concatamerization of AAVs through intermolecular recombination ( Yang et al., 1999 53. Yang, J. ∙ Zhou, W. ∙ Zhang, Y. ... Concatamerization of adeno-associated virus circular genomes occurs through intermolecular recombination J.

The following wild-type or transgenic mouse lines were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory: C57BL/6J (stock #000664), Aldh1l1-CreER T2 (stock #029655) ( Srinivasan et al., 2016 38. Srinivasan, R. ∙ Lu, T.Y. ∙ Chai, H. ... New transgenic mouse lines for selectively targeting astrocytes and studying calcium signals in astrocyte processes in situ and in vivo Neuron. 2016; 92 :1181-1195 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (274) PubMed Google Scholar ), mGfap-Cre line 77.6 (stock #024098) ( Gregorian et al., 2009 14. Gregorian, C. ∙ Nakashima, J. ∙ Le Belle, J. ... Pten deletion in adult neural stem/progenitor cells enhances constitutive neurogenesis J. Neurosci. 2009; 29 :1874-1886 Crossref Scopus (216) PubMed Google Scholar ), R26R-YFP (stock #006148) ( Srinivas et al., 2001 37. Srinivas, S. ∙ Watanabe, T. ∙ Lin, C.S. ... Cre reporter strains produced by targeted insertion of EYFP and ECFP into the ROSA26 locus BMC Dev Biol. 2001; 1 :4 Crossref Scopus (2456) PubMed Google Scholar ), and R26R-tdTomato (stock #007914) ( Madisen et al., 2010 25. Madisen, L. ∙ Zwingman, T.A. ∙ Sunkin, S.M. ... A robust and high-throughput Cre reporting and characterization system for the whole mouse brain Nat Neurosci. 2010; 13 :133-140 Crossref Scopus (4610) PubMed Google Scholar ). Hemizygous Aldh1l1-CreER T2 males or females were used for breeding, whereas only hemizygous females of mGfap-Cre were used for breeding. After breeding to the reporter mouse lines, cell type-specificity of the traced cells was extensively examined by immunohistochemistry in different brain regions. Of note, except for the core striatum the mGfap-Cre line shows variable leaky expression in neurons of different brain regions including the cortex and midbrain. Both adult male and female mice at 8 weeks or older were used for most of the experiments, whereas young mice at postnatal day (P) 35 to 40 days were used for the shRNA experiments as described ( Qian et al., 2020 35. Qian, H. ∙ Kang, X. ∙ Hu, J. ... Reversing a model of Parkinson’s disease with in situ converted nigral neurons Nature. 2020; 582 :550-556 Crossref Scopus (296) PubMed Google Scholar ). All mice were housed under controlled temperature and a 12-h light/dark cycle with free access to water and food in an animal barrier facility at UT Southwestern. Animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at UT Southwestern.
Primary mouse cortical astrocytes were isolated from wild-type mice at postnatal day 2 as previously described ( Ma et al., 2020 24. Ma, S. ∙ Zang, T. ∙ Liu, M.L. ... Aging-relevant human basal forebrain cholinergic neurons as a cell model for Alzheimer’s disease Mol. Neurodegener. 2020; 15 :61 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, cortices were dissociated with a solution containing papain (10 U/mL, with 1 mM Ca 2+ and 0.5 mM EDTA) and 1% DNase for 20 min at 37°C. Tissues were pelleted through brief centrifugation and further dissociated using a pipette in FBS-containing medium. Cells were passed through a 40-μm nylon strainer, and the cell mixture was spun at 400 g for 3 min and re-suspended in growth media consisting of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and plated into 0.1% gelatin-coated 75 cm 2 flasks. Media was exchanged every 3 days. To test PTBP1 knock down efficiency in vitro , astrocytes were seeded on matrigel-coated culture vessels. 24 hours later, cells were transduced with lentivirus in the presence of 6 μg/mL polybrene. After overnight incubation, culture media were refreshed. Medium was half-changed every other day. Cell lysates were collected at 7 dpv for analysis.
Human U251 glioma cells (Sigma) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were seeded on Matrigel-coated culture vessels. The following day, they were infected with the indicated lentivirus in the presence of 6 μg/mL polybrene. After overnight incubation, culture media were refreshed. One day later, the cells were then switched to neuronal induction medium, consisting of DMEM:F12:Neurobasal (2:2:1), 0.8% N-2 (GIBCO), and 0.4% B-27 (GIBCO). In addition, forskolin (10 μM) and dorsomorphin (1 μM) were added to the above induction medium. Induction medium was half-changed every other day. Immuno-fluorescence staining for neuronal markers was performed on 21 days post viral infection.
The AAV vectors driven by hGFAP promoter listed in Key resources table were constructed through PCR-based subcloning. Unless indicated otherwise, the hGFAP promoter used in this study is the synthetic 681-bp gfaABC1D derived from the 2.2-kb gfa2 promoter ( Lee et al., 2008 19. Lee, Y. ∙ Messing, A. ∙ Su, M. ... GFAP promoter elements required for region-specific and astrocyte-specific expression Glia. 2008; 56 :481-493 Crossref Scopus (258) PubMed Google Scholar ). Both promoters exhibit identical astrocyte-restricted expression patterns through transgenic analyses ( Lee et al., 2008 19. Lee, Y. ∙ Messing, A. ∙ Su, M. ... GFAP promoter elements required for region-specific and astrocyte-specific expression Glia. 2008; 56 :481-493 Crossref Scopus (258) PubMed Google Scholar ). The CAG promoter was derived from the pAAV-CAG-GFP vector (Addgene #37825), whereas the FLEX system was based on the pAAV-CAG-FLEX-GFP vector (Addgene #28304). The Cre-dependent loxP-STOP-loxP (LSL) cassette was subcloned from the Ai9 plasmid (Addgene #22799). pAAV-GFAP-CasRx and pAAV-GFAP-CasRx-Ptbp1 were obtained from Addgene (#154000 and #154001), whereas pAAV-CMV-LSL-RFP and pAAV-CMV-LSL-RFP-shPtbp1 were provided by Fu Laboratory ( Qian et al., 2020 35. Qian, H. ∙ Kang, X. ∙ Hu, J. ... Reversing a model of Parkinson’s disease with in situ converted nigral neurons Nature. 2020; 582 :550-556 Crossref Scopus (296) PubMed Google Scholar ). All vectors were verified through restriction enzyme digestions and DNA sequencing. AAV viruses were packaged with pAd-deltaF6 (Addgene #112867) and the helper pAAV2/2 (Addgene #104963), pAAV2/5 (Addgene #104964), pAAV2/8 (Addgene #112864), pAAV2/9 (Addgene #112865), pUCmini-iCAP-PHP.eB (Addgene #103005), or rAAV2-retro (Addgene #81070) in HEK293T cells. Briefly, HEK293T cells were transfected with the packaging plasmids and a vector plasmid. Three days later, virus was collected from the cell lysates and culture media. Virus was purified through iodixanol gradient ultracentrifugation, washed with PBS, and concentrated with 100K PES concentrator (Pierce™, Thermo Scientific). Viral titers were determined by quantitative PCR with ITR primers (forward: 5- GGAACCCCTAGTGATGGAGTT -3; reverse: 5- CGGCCTCAGTGAGCGA -3). The AAV5-hGFAP ∗ -Cre virus was obtained from Addgene (#105550), in which Cre is driven by the 2.2-kb gfa2 promoter. Based on publications, virus with a titer range from 1e12 - 4e13 GC/mL was used for experiments (details in Table S1 ).
The controlled cortical impact (CCI) model of TBI was employed as previously described ( Chen et al., 2019 6. Chen, C. ∙ Zhong, X. ∙ Smith, D.K. ... Astrocyte-specific deletion of Sox2 promotes functional recovery after traumatic brain injury Cereb. Cortex. 2019; 29 :54-69 Crossref Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ). Under anesthesia, a skin incision was made in the mouse forehead to expose the skull. A craniotomy was performed over the right hemisphere and the bone flap (2.2 mm in diameter) was carefully removed. A cortical injury (0 bregma, 1 mm lateral to the sagittal suture line) was introduced at an impact depth of 0.5 mm with a 2-mm diameter round impact tip (3.0 m/s speed and 100 ms dwell time) by using an electromagnetically driven CCI device (Impact One™ Stereotaxic CCI Instrument, Leica). After injury, skin was sutured and further secured with liquid adhesive. Intracerebral viral injections (1∼4 μL per injection, details in Table S1 ) were performed on a stereotaxic frame. The injection coordinates were as the following: +1.0 mm anterior/posterior (AP), ± 1.5 mm medial/lateral (ML), and −0.8 mm dorsal/ventral from the skull (DV) for uninjured cortex; 0 mm AP, ± 1.5 mm ML, and −0.8 mm DV for injured cortex; 1.0 mm AP, ± 2.0 mm ML, and −3.0 mm DV for adult striatum; 0.8 mm AP, ± 1.8 mm ML, and −2.7 mm DV for young striatum.
rAAV2-retro-CAG-GFP virus (2 μL per mouse) was injected into the T6 level of dorsal spinal cord to target the corticospinal tract. 3-10 days post rAAV2-retro injection, we stereotaxically injected AAV5 virus into the cortex with the following coordinates: −0.5 mm AP, ± 1.5 mm ML, and −1.0 mm DV.
Tamoxifen (Cayman Chemical) was dissolved in a mixture of ethanol and sesame oil (1:9 by volume) at a concentration of 40 mg/mL. Tamoxifen was administered through intraperitoneal injections at a daily dose of 1 mg/10 g body weight for 3-9 days. BrdU (Alfa Aesar Chemical; 0.5 g/L) was supplied in drinking water for durations as indicated in the text.
The following lentivirus vectors were constructed through PCR-based subcloning into the pCSC-IRES-GFP vector ( Ding et al., 2021 9. Ding, B. ∙ Tang, Y. ∙ Ma, S. ...

Fellmann, C. ∙ Hoffmann, T. ∙ Sridhar, V. ... An optimized microRNA backbone for effective single-copy RNAi Cell Rep. 2013; 5 :1704-1713 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (466) PubMed Google Scholar ). The third generation, replication-deficient lentivirus was generated in HEK293T cells by transient transfections with lentiviral vectors and the packaging plasmids (pMDL, VSV-G and pREV).
Mice were euthanized and perfused with intracardial injection of 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Brains were isolated and post-fixed overnight with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde at 4°C. After cryoprotection with 30% sucrose in PBS for 72 h at 4°C, 40-μm brain slices were collected through a sliding microtome (Leica). For immunostaining, brain sections were treated with 50% formamide in 1 X SSC buffer for 2 h at 65°C. For BrdU staining, the sections were pretreated with 2N HCl for 30 min at 37°C. The following primary antibodies were used: GFP (Chicken; 1:2,000; Aves Labs), mCherry (Goat; 1:2,000; Mybiosource), NeuN (Rabbit; 1:10,000; Abcam), GFAP (Mouse; 1:2,000; Sigma), Cre (Rabbit; 1:500; Covance), ALDH1L1 (Mouse; 1:200; Neuromab), ALDOC (Goat; 1:100; Santa Cruz), BrdU (Rat; 1:500; Bio-Rad), NEUROD1 (Rabbit; 1:1,000; Abcam), PTBP1 (Rabbit, 1:1,000, ABclonal), FLAG (Rabbit; 1:300; Sigma), HA (Chicken; 1:300; Aves), DCX (Goat; 1:500; Santa Cruz), and MAP2 (Mouse; 1:1,000; Proteintech). Alexa Fluor 488-, 555-, or 647-conjugated corresponding secondary antibodies from Jackson ImmunoResearch were used for indirect fluorescence (1:2,000). Nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33342 (Hst). Images were captured using a Zeiss LSM700 or Nikon A1R confocal microscope for analysis.
Whole-cell lysates were obtained through direct lysis of cells in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP40, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Equal amounts of these lysates (10 μg per lane) were used for SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis. Samples were immunoblotted against PTBP1 (Rabbit; 1:1,000; ABclonal) or the loading control ACTB (Mouse; 1:20,000; Proteintech), followed by their corresponding HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (HRP conjugated anti rabbit or anti mouse IgG 1:10,000, Jackson Laboratory). Blots were developed with Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP substrate (Millipore) and visualized using ChemiDoc imaging system (BioRad).
Four representative images from the top and middle layer of the cortex near the injection site were collected and quantified for each brain sample to confirm cell identity or conversion rate. To determine the local density of neurons or astrocytes, NeuN + or GFAP + cells were quantified from a 1-μm thick confocal image with an area of 0.102977 mm 2 . Four to six random confocal images surrounding the viral injection area with evenly distributed reporter + cells were analyzed for each animal. Quantification data are presented as mean ± SEM from 3-5 mice per group. Statistical analysis was performed by homoscedastic two-tailed Student’s t test using the GraphPad Prism software v. 6.0. A p value < 0.05 was considered significant. Significant differences are indicated by ∗ p < 0.05, ∗∗ p < 0.01, ∗∗∗ p < 0.001, and ∗∗∗∗ p < 0.0001.
