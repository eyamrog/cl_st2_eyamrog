Title: Coupled scRNA-Seq and Intracellular Protein Activity Reveal an Immunosuppressive Role of TREM2 in Cancer


Abstract: Summary

Cell function and activity are regulated through integration of signaling, epigenetic, transcriptional, and metabolic pathways. Here, we introduce INs-seq, an integrated technology for massively parallel recording of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and intracellular protein activity. We demonstrate the broad utility of INs-seq for discovering new immune subsets by profiling different intracellular signatures of immune signaling, transcription factor combinations, and metabolic activity. Comprehensive mapping of Arginase 1-expressing cells within tumor models, a metabolic immune signature of suppressive activity, discovers novel Arg1 + Trem2 + regulatory myeloid (Mreg) cells and identifies markers, metabolic activity, and pathways associated with these cells. Genetic ablation of Trem2 in mice inhibits accumulation of intra-tumoral Mreg cells, leading to a marked decrease in dysfunctional CD8 + T cells and reduced tumor growth. This study establishes INs-seq as a broadly applicable technology for elucidating integrated transcriptional and intra-cellular maps and identifies the molecular signature of myeloid suppressive cells in tumors.

Section: Introduction

Cell fate and function are determined by integration of the cell’s molecular composition with its metabolic and signaling activity. Recent advances in single-cell genomic technologies have provided an unprecedented amount of data on the RNA, protein, and chromatin states of cells within tissues ( Griffiths et al., 2018 19.

These advances have dramatically improved the way we understand the cellular and molecular makeup of tissues and how they are perturbed during pathology ( Linde et al., 2018 35.

Despite these important developments, we still lack technologies that effectively link cellular transcriptional states with intracellular, post-translational states, such as those linked to signaling pathway activation and metabolic activity. Recent breakthroughs have linked single-cell transcriptomics data with quantitative protein measurements using index sorting (MARS-seq, GateID; Baron et al., 2019 6.

Methods. 2017; 14 :865-868 Crossref Scopus (1711) PubMed Google Scholar ), but all are limited to cell surface proteins, whereas most of the signal transduction, metabolic, and transcriptional pathways are intracellular. Transcription factor (TF) combinations define the cell developmental trajectory together with its potential to respond to extracellular signals and have been shown to represent homogeneous cell subsets more precisely than surface markers ( Schaum et al., 2018 42. Schaum, N. ∙ Karkanias, J. ∙ Neff, N.F. ..., Tabula Muris Consortium, Overall coordination, Logistical coordination, Organ collection and processing, Library preparation and sequencing, Computational data analysis, Cell type annotation, Writing group, Supplemental text writing group, Principal investigators Single-cell transcriptomics of 20 mouse organs creates a Tabula Muris Nature. 2018; 562 :367-372 Crossref Scopus (1502) PubMed Google Scholar ). In line with this, engineered TF reporter models play a critical role in defining new immune subsets ( Josefowicz and Rudensky, 2009 26. Josefowicz, S.Z. ∙ Rudensky, A.

Immunol. 2016; 34 :93-119 Crossref Scopus (322) PubMed Google Scholar ) but are difficult to scale or use in a human context because they are dependent on engineered animal models.
To record the activity of intracellular proteins, cell fixation and permeabilization are required. Current cell fixation and permeabilization methods are destructive to mRNA integrity, limiting our ability to measure the intracellular protein landscape along with RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in single cells. So far, efforts to combine single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) with fixation, permeabilization, and intracellular readouts have been difficult to scale and are limited to simple tissue culture models ( Alles et al., 2017 1.

Messenger RNA quantification after fluorescence activated cell sorting using intracellular antigens Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2010; 397 :425-428 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ). Technologies that enable transcriptional and intracellular protein profiling can potentially be a cornerstone for a better understanding of the interplay between epigenetic, transcriptional, signaling, and metabolic circuits that govern cellular function. Such technologies can be utilized to characterize complex cellular responses, such as the immune response to pathogens, cancer, and other pathologies.
Immune cells sense and respond to a large array of environmental signals, such as pathogen-associated molecular patterns. These signals are recognized by specialized receptors (e.g., Toll-like receptors [TLRs]) and processed by intracellular signaling cascades to ultimately activate a variety of transcriptional and metabolic pathways that govern the immune response ( Kumar et al., 2011 33. Kumar, H. ∙ Kawai, T. ∙ Akira, S. Pathogen recognition by the innate immune system Int. Rev. Immunol. 2011; 30 :16-34 Crossref Scopus (1709) PubMed Google Scholar ). Characterization of these intracellular signaling pathways is mostly studied using established cell surface markers. This methodology potentially biases our knowledge of signaling and metabolic activities associated with diverse immune functions.
One example of such elusive and poorly characterized immune function is myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), known to promote a suppressive environment for effector T cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME) and support tumor growth and immune dysfunction ( Gabrilovich, 2017 13. Gabrilovich, D.I. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells Cancer Immunol. Res. 2017; 5 :3-8 Crossref Scopus (1324) PubMed Google Scholar ; Gabrilovich and Nagaraj, 2009 14. Gabrilovich, D.I. ∙ Nagaraj, S. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells as regulators of the immune system Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 9 :162-174 Crossref Scopus (5478) PubMed Google Scholar ). Despite MDSCs’ critical effect on treatment outcome in a broad spectrum of human disease and cancer types, their precise functional roles and molecular identity have been elusive and ill defined. MDSCs do not conform to conventional surface marker-based classification schemes and are classified using broad myeloid surface markers, various cellular assays, and metabolic properties, including expression of an immunosuppressive metabolic pathway expressing Arginase 1 (Arg1) ( Arlauckas et al., 2018 3. Arlauckas, S.P. ∙ Garren, S.B. ∙ Garris, C.S. ... Arg1 expression defines immunosuppressive subsets of tumor-associated macrophages Theranostics. 2018; 8 :5842-5854 Crossref Scopus (194) PubMed Google Scholar ; Veglia et al., 2018 54. Veglia, F. ∙ Perego, M. ∙ Gabrilovich, D. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells coming of age Nat. Immunol. 2018; 19 :108-119 Crossref Scopus (1264) PubMed Google Scholar ). A thorough molecular understanding of this important and heterogeneous group of myeloid cells, based on their suppressive metabolic potential, may lead to identification of their molecular markers, pathways, and activity, ultimately leading to more effective biomarkers and targeted immunotherapy.
Together, these challenges highlight the need for new single-cell technologies capturing transcriptional and intracellular protein activity. Here we present intracellular staining and sequencing (INs-seq) integrated technology that combines the resolution of massively parallel scRNA-seq with intracellular protein measurements. We demonstrate the potential of INs-seq for profiling intracellular and post-translationally modified proteins (PTM), signaling pathways, TFs, and metabolism-related proteins combined with scRNA-seq. Using INs-seq, we define the response of bone marrow myeloid culture to the TLR4 agonist lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Single-cell profiling of phospho-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (pp38 MAPK (pT180/pY182))-positive and -negative cell populations identified that dendritic cells are not responsive to an LPS signal, in contrast to monocytes. We further demonstrate the specificity of our technology by profiling regulatory T (Treg) cells, which have no specific surface marker, using intracellular immunostaining of the Treg cell-specific TF FOXP3 in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and mice and benchmark these results to Foxp3-RFP transgenic mice. INs-seq profiling of the TFs TCF7, ID2, and TCF7 and ID2 double-positive populations shows the potential of the technology to define new T cell subsets. Finally, we focus on characterizing MDSCs based on their metabolic features to reveal their cellular and molecular profile in the TME and identify markers and pathways specific for MDSCs. Our data revealed a new Trem2 + regulatory monocyte population, regulatory myeloid (Mreg) cells, as major myeloid suppressive cells in a mouse fibrosarcoma syngeneic tumor model. Genetic ablation of Trem2 in these mice inhibits accumulation of Mreg cells, leading to a significant decrease in dysfunctional CD8 + T cells and reduced tumor growth. This study establishes INs-seq as a broadly applicable technology for elucidating integrated transcriptional and signaling maps and identifies the molecular signature of myeloid suppressive cells.

Section: Results

To integrate the intracellular signaling state and the cellular transcriptional profile, we developed INs-seq, an integrative technology for intracellular protein immunodetection followed by scRNA-seq ( Figure 1 A). In this protocol, cells are fixed and permeabilized using a fixative based on methanol (MeOH) and ammonium sulfate solutions that precipitates proteins, inhibits enzymatic activity, and enables RNA preservation and immuno-intracellular staining ( STAR Methods ). The permeabilized cells can then be labeled intracellularly with fluorophore-conjugated antibodies and sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) according to their intracellular fluorescent signal intensity, followed by scRNA-seq using plate-based or microfluidics-based approaches ( STAR Methods ).
To evaluate INs-seq efficiency in preserving mRNA and allowing simultaneous intracellular labeling, we compared INs-seq fixation with three commonly used fixation methods: PFA (paraformaldehyde), methanol, and DSP (dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate)). We differentiated mouse bone marrow-derived cells in the presence of GM-CSF (BMDC culture) and stimulated the culture with LPS for 20 min. We then processed the cultured cells using INs-seq fixation or the three other fixation methods. Cells were stained for the extracellular markers CD11c and Ly6G and sorted for CD11c + , Ly6G − (BMDC) and the intracellular active form of the p38 MAPK, phospho-p38 (pT180/pY182). Cells processed by PFA, MeOH, and INs-seq (but not DSP) showed a clear fluorescent pp38 signal ( Figure 1 B). Further, INs-seq fixation was compatible with a wide range of commonly used FACS fluorophores ( Figure S1 A; see STAR Methods for recommended INs-seq fluorophores). To quantify preservation of mRNA by the different fixation protocols, we extracted mRNA from 5,000 sorted BMDC, generated cDNA, and amplified cDNA from the isolated cells. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) measurement of the housekeeping gene β-actin ( Actb ) showed marked differences between the protocols ( Figure 1 C). INs-seq preserved 84-fold more Actb mRNA molecules compared with the second-best fixation method (MeOH fixation) and more than 600-folds more over PFA and DSP. Similar results were obtained from mouse and human primary cell types ( Figure S1 B). Additionally, INs-seq enabled almost complete preservation of mRNA of fixed cells stored at −20°C for up to at least 2 weeks ( Figure 1 C). Importantly, INs-seq-fixed samples demonstrated a minor reduction in mRNA detection compared with fresh non-fixed samples ( Figure S1 C).
To further examine the quality of INs-seq fixation, we constructed scRNA-seq libraries using the droplet-based chromium platform from fresh and INs-seq-fixed BMDC. We used the Seurat integration workflow to integrate INs-seq and fresh samples and clustered them together ( Stuart et al., 2019 48. Stuart, T. ∙ Butler, A. ∙ Hoffman, P. ... Comprehensive Integration of Single-Cell Data Cell. 2019; 177 :1888-1902.e21 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (7322) PubMed Google Scholar ). INs-seq-processed cells displayed a 50%–60% reduction in the number of unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) per cell compared with fresh cells ( Figure 1 D). However, this reduction in UMI count was uniform and not biased toward any specific cell type. Therefore, despite this mRNA loss, INs-seq preserves the same cell population distribution observed in fresh, non-fixed cells ( Figures 1 E and 1F). Compared with scRNA-seq of fresh cells, INs-seq preferably samples long genes (>10 kb), including non-coding RNA, over short genes (<1,000 bp), suggesting that some RNA fragmentation still occurs during sample processing ( Figures S1 D and S1E). However, clustering and projection of the fresh and INs-seq data on the same manifold identify the same differential genes and dynamic ranges between the cell populations ( Figures 1 F and S1 F; Table S1). To evaluate the robustness and clinical potential of INs-seq, we fixed human PBMC samples ( STAR Methods ). Comparison of fresh and INs-seq-fixed CD45 + immune blood cells from three individuals shows an overall high similarity in cell population distribution, except a small enrichment of one monocyte population in the INs-seq samples ( Figures 1 G, 1H, and S2A– S2 C; Table S2). Together, these results demonstrate the efficiency of INs-seq in labeling intracellular proteins while preserving the mRNA content in single cells.
The myeloid compartment is composed of diverse cell types and states that respond differently to environmental signals ( Glass and Natoli, 2016 18. Glass, C.K. ∙ Natoli, G. Molecular control of activation and priming in macrophages Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17 :26-33 Crossref Scopus (369) PubMed Google Scholar ; Jaitin et al., 2016 24. Jaitin, D.A. ∙ Weiner, A. ∙ Yofe, I. ... Dissecting Immune Circuits by Linking CRISPR-Pooled Screens with Single-Cell RNA-Seq Cell. 2016; 167 :1883-1896.e15 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (501) PubMed Google Scholar ). To better understand the complexity of the myeloid response to pathogen signals, we stimulated the bone marrow culture with LPS and performed INs-seq fixation and intracellular staining with fluorescent pp38, a downstream component of the TLR4 signaling cascade ( Amit et al., 2009 2. Amit, I. ∙ Garber, M. ∙ Chevrier, N. ... Unbiased reconstruction of a mammalian transcriptional network mediating pathogen responses Science. 2009; 326 :257-263 Crossref Scopus (406) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kumar et al., 2011 33. Kumar, H. ∙ Kawai, T. ∙ Akira, S. Pathogen recognition by the innate immune system Int. Rev. Immunol. 2011; 30 :16-34 Crossref Scopus (1709) PubMed Google Scholar ). The BMDC cultures were then sorted by FACS according to the intensity of their pp38 signal and processed using the chromium platform ( Figures 2 A and S3 A). We used the Seurat integration and clustering workflow and identified 4 clusters of cells from the BMDC scRNA-seq data, including monocytes, cycling monocytes, dendritic cells (DCs) and a monocyte-DC population ( Figure 2 B). By quantification of pp38 enrichment score in each cluster, based on its fraction in the pp38 + over pp38 - populations, we identified a significant depletion of the DC population. The DC (e.g., expressing Ccr7 , Ccl22 , and the major histocompatibility complex [MHC] class II pathway) population was dramatically diminished in the pp38 + fraction ( Figures 2 C, 2D, and S3 B).
LPS is mainly sensed through the TLR4 pathway and its co-receptor CD14, which regulates TLR4 endocytosis ( Zanoni et al., 2011 58. Zanoni, I. ∙ Ostuni, R. ∙ Marek, L.R. ... CD14 controls the LPS-induced endocytosis of Toll-like receptor 4 Cell. 2011; 147 :868-880 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (715) PubMed Google Scholar ). Comparison of the expression of TLR4 and CD14 in the BMDC populations showed diminished gene expression of TLR4, CD14, and the major TLR4 signaling adaptor MyD88 in DCs compared with the other cell populations in the culture ( Figure 2 E). Correspondingly, FACS analysis of monocytes (CD14 high CD11c + ) cells showed a high pp38 signal compared with the DC (CD14 low CD11c + ) population ( Figure S3 C). In line with these findings, DC (MHC class II high CD11c + ) showed a decreased pp38 signal compared with monocytes (MHC class II mid Cd11c + ; Figure 2 F; Helft et al., 2015 21. Helft, J. ∙ Böttcher, J. ∙ Chakravarty, P. ... GM-CSF Mouse Bone Marrow Cultures Comprise a Heterogeneous Population of CD11c(+)MHCII(+) Macrophages and Dendritic Cells Immunity. 2015; 42 :1197-1211 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (591) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, LPS stimulation of BMDC resulted in a minor inflammatory response in the DC population compared with a massive response of the monocyte populations ( Figure 2 G). In summary, we demonstrate INs-seq to be a robust technology for single-cell characterization of transcriptional and signaling activity and show that signaling downstream of LPS stimulation is blunted in DCs compared with monocytes, including the pp38 MAPK and downstream inflammatory cytokines.
The complex gene expression programs that underlie development, differentiation, and environmental responses are determined by binding of sequence-specific TFs. TF combinations may faithfully define the cell’s developmental trajectory together with its prospect to respond to extracellular signals and can potentially be applied for precise cell characterization of diverse immune subsets. So far, genetic engineering of TF reporters, with all of its limitations, is the major approach for such efforts and is an instrumental tool for discovery of novel immune populations. The TF factor Foxp3, a master regulator of Treg cell development and function, is the only discriminative marker to purify Treg cells from other T cells ( Kim and Rudensky, 2006 30. Kim, J.M. ∙ Rudensky, A. The role of the transcription factor Foxp3 in the development of regulatory T cells Immunol. Rev. 2006; 212 :86-98 Crossref Scopus (149) PubMed Google Scholar ). Currently, cell surface markers used for purification and characterization of Treg cells in different tissues and pathologies are limited ( Chen and Oppenheim, 2011 11. Chen, X. ∙ Oppenheim, J.J. Resolving the identity myth: Key markers of functional CD4 +FoxP3 + regulatory T cells Int. Immunopharmacol. 2011; 11 :1489-1496 Crossref Scopus (94) PubMed Google Scholar ). To assess INs-seq efficiency for in vivo mapping of Treg cells, we used a Foxp3-RFP transgenic mouse expressing a fluorescent Foxp3 reporter (Tg(Foxp3-RFP,-cre); STAR Methods ), where the Foxp3 promoter drives the expression of RFP and Cre recombinase. We enriched for Treg cells from Foxp3-RFP cervical lymph nodes (cLNs) by sorting TCRb + RFP + cells or applying the INs-seq protocol and sorting antibody-stained TCRb + Foxp3 + cells ( Figures 3 A and S4 A). scRNA-seq libraries were constructed from unfixed Foxp3-RFP + and fixed Foxp3 + cells ( STAR Methods ). Analysis of the scRNA-seq data of 5,483 cells created a map of the cell types profiled in Foxp3 + fixed and RFP + unfixed cLN samples and identified similar Treg cell enrichments using genetic and antibody-based Foxp3 + strategies ( Figures 3 B, S4 B, and S4C; 80% and 60%, respectively). Similarly, isolated Treg cells from both strategies demonstrated expression of the same Treg cell gene modules and markers ( Figure S4 D).
Treg cells are key mediators of immunosuppression within the TME ( Magnuson et al., 2018 36. Magnuson, A.M. ∙ Kiner, E. ∙ Ergun, A. ... Identification and validation of a tumor-infiltrating Treg transcriptional signature conserved across species and tumor types Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115 :E10672-E10681 Crossref Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ; Togashi et al., 2019 50. Togashi, Y. ∙ Shitara, K. ∙ Nishikawa, H. Regulatory T cells in cancer immunosuppression - implications for anticancer therapy Nat. Rev. Clin. Oncol. 2019; 16 :356-371 Crossref Scopus (921) PubMed Google Scholar ). To compare the molecular profiles of cLN and tumor Treg cells, we isolated tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), and applied INs-seq to profile the TME CD45 + TCRb + Foxp3 + and CD45 + TCRb + Foxp3 − cell populations. Analysis identified that the Foxp3 + population contained Treg cells and related transcriptomics signatures, comprising high levels of expression of Foxp3 , Ctla4 , Il2ra , and different members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family (e.g., Tnfrsf4 and Tnfrsf18 ) ( Figure S5 A). In line with previous studies, Treg cells isolated from cLNs expressed a gene module related to naive and circulating T cells, such as Ccr7 , Tcf7 , and Lef1 ( Ricardo Miragaia et al., 2019 41.

Cell Biol. 2019; 97 :787-798 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ), whereas Treg cells isolated from the TME exhibited an active Treg cell-suppressive phenotype, expressing high levels of Gzmb , Ccr2 , and the TNF receptor family members 18 and 9 ( Azizi et al., 2018 4.

Granzyme B and perforin are important for regulatory T cell-mediated suppression of tumor clearance Immunity. 2007; 27 :635-646 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (707) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 3 C). In summary, by targeting the Treg cell-specific TF Foxp3 from the mouse circulation (lymph nodes) and TME, we demonstrate application of the INs-seq technology to combine TF labeling with scRNA-seq.
We next aimed to define the molecular identity of diverse T cell states in human PBMC. For this we applied INs-seq and targeted a combination of key TFs involved in T cell biology: FOXP3, the master regulator of the Treg cell phenotype, and two major CD8 T cell TFs, T cell factor 7 (TCF7) and inhibitor of DNA binding 2 (ID2). We applied the INs-seq protocol on PBMC and gated for CD3 + FOXP3 + ; CD8 + ,TCF7 + ; ID2 + single-positive (SP); or TCF7 + ID2 + double-positive (DP) T cells. We then sequenced these populations, resulting in 14,245 cells ( Figures S5 B and S5C; Table S3). The CD3 + FOXP3 + sample was then compared with the whole PBMC fraction from the same donor and showed enrichment of human CD4 Treg cells, expressing the canonical Treg cell markers FOXP3 , TNFRSF4 , IL2RA , IKZF2, and TIGIT ( Figures 3 D, 3E, and S5 D). Although FOXP3 is an example of an extensively studied cell-type-specific TF in humans and mouse models, the functional roles of TCF7 and ID2 T cell subsets are only partially characterized. TCF7 is a critical regulator of T cell development and self-renewal potential ( Kratchmarov et al., 2018 32. Kratchmarov, R. ∙ Magun, A.M. ∙ Reiner, S.L.

Upon antigen encounter and effector differentiation, CD8 T cells require ID2 for survival and proliferation ( Cannarile et al., 2006 9. Cannarile, M.A. ∙ Lind, N.A. ∙ Rivera, R. ...

TCF7 and ID2 have been shown to be expressed in memory CD8 T cells and to play a key role in CD8 T cells during viral infection and tumor progression ( Held et al., 2019 20.

Immunol. 2013; 190 :4585-4594 Crossref Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ); however, the exact interplay of these two essential elements in dictating CD8 T cells states is still unclear. Notably, CD8 T cells lacking both of these TFs (double-negative) were not observed, exemplifying their importance in controlling CD8 T cell states ( Figure S5 C).
In line with previous studies ( Willinger et al., 2006 55. Willinger, T. ∙ Freeman, T. ∙ Herbert, M. ... Human naive CD8 T cells down-regulate expression of the WNT pathway transcription factors lymphoid enhancer binding factor 1 and transcription factor 7 (T cell factor-1) following antigen encounter in vitro and in vivo J.

Differentiation and persistence of memory CD8(+) T cells depend on T cell factor 1 Immunity. 2010; 33 :229-240 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (502) PubMed Google Scholar ) the TCF7 + gate showed expression of gene modules associated with a naive phenotype, such as CCR7 , SELL , and LEF1 ( Figure S5 E). This population occupies 94% of the TCF7 + gate with a 36-fold enrichment compared with the fraction of this population in the CD45 + immune gate ( Figures 3 F, 3I, and 3J). In contrast, the ID2 + gate was characterized with CD8 T cell effector functions, expressing many of the genes associated with the cytotoxic machinery ( GNLY , GZMA/B , and PRF1 ) alongside other markers of cytotoxic T cells, such as NKG7 , FGFBP2 , and CX3CR1 ( Figure S5 E). The effector cells occupied 93% of the ID2 + gate with 11-fold enrichment compared with their fraction in the CD45 + immune population ( Figures 3 G, 3I, and 3J). The TCF7 + ID2 + DP gate defined less characterized T cell subsets and was specifically enriched for two cell states of central memory (CM) and one state of effector memory (EM) T cells ( Figure 3 H). The two CM phenotypes share expression of KLRG1 and ITGB1 as well as naive markers such as CCR7 and SELL . The CM phenotypes segregated based on expression of CXCR3 , CCL5 , and GZMK in CM1 and TNFRSF4 in CM2 ( Figure S5 E). EM cells express low levels of the naive markers and are characterized by expression of GZMK , KLRG1 , KLRB1 , and PRF1 . Altogether, we demonstrate INs-seq to be a powerful tool for studying the interplay between different TFs in controlling cellular state in humans and mice at the single-cell level.
Myeloid cells play a key role in controlling activation and inhibition of adaptive anti-tumor responses. However, to date, there are no clear cell surface molecules other than broad lineage markers (CD11b and Gr-1) to define myeloid suppressive cells, limiting molecular and functional characterization of this important lineage. The Arg1 enzyme, which metabolizes arginine to urea and ornithine, supports many physiological processes, such as liver function and collagen production ( Caldwell et al., 2018 8. Caldwell, R.W. ∙ Rodriguez, P.C. ∙ Toque, H.A. ... Arginase: A multifaceted enzyme important in health and disease Physiol. Rev. 2018; 98 :641-665 Crossref Scopus (300) PubMed Google Scholar ). Within the immune compartment, suppressive myeloid populations activate the Arg1 pathway, depriving the microenvironment of arginine, an essential amino acid for T cell activity ( Bronte et al., 2003 7. Bronte, V. ∙ Serafini, P. ∙ Mazzoni, A. ... L-arginine metabolism in myeloid cells controls T-lymphocyte functions Trends Immunol. 2003; 24 :302-306 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (479) PubMed Google Scholar ). Arg1, alongside other metabolic proteins, is a hallmark of tumor-associated myeloid suppressor cells that accumulate under pathological conditions ( Gabrilovich, 2017 13. Gabrilovich, D.I. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells Cancer Immunol. Res. 2017; 5 :3-8 Crossref Scopus (1324) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kumar et al., 2016 34. Kumar, V. ∙ Patel, S. ∙ Tcyganov, E. ... The Nature of Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells in the Tumor Microenvironment Trends Immunol. 2016; 37 :208-220 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1478) PubMed Google Scholar ). To deeply characterize myeloid suppressor cells within the TME, we applied INs-seq to isolate and profile Arg1-expressing cells from a mouse tumor model and define their cellular and molecular pathways ( Figure 4 A).
We fixed and sorted by FACS CD45 + CD11b + Arg1 + and CD45 + CD11b + Arg1 − cell populations from the TME of MCA205 tumor-bearing mice ( Figure S6 A). Of 8,280 QC-positive cells, we removed the lymphoid, granulocyte, and DC populations from the myeloid Arg1 map for separate analysis. 7,648 cells were defined as monocytes and macrophages based on marker genes expression ( STAR Methods ). Metacell analysis identified 77 metacells comprising 6 distinct populations ( Figures 4 B and 4C; Table S4). For each metacell, we computed an Arg1 enrichment score based on its fraction in the Arg1 + over Arg1 − populations ( Figures 4 B). We found high correlation between the Arg1 enrichment score and its transcription levels ( Figures S6 B–S6D). The myeloid compartment in the TME was characterized by two major Arg1 + populations: tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), distinguished by expression of C1qa , Spp1 , Cx3Cr1 , and Apoe , and an Mreg cell population expressing Gpnmb , Il7r , Hilpda , Vegfa , Hmox1 , and Clec4d , among other differentially expressed genes ( Figures 4 B and 4C). The four Arg1 − populations could be distinguished by expression of specific markers: Plac8 , Ly6c2 , Ccr2 , MHC class II-related genes, and a signature associated with type I interferon signaling ( Figures 4 B and 4C). Analysis of the Arg1 + and Arg1 − metacells resulted in the de novo identification of a rich set of co-regulated gene modules ( Figure 4 C). This analysis further identified Podoplanin ( Pdpn ) and triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 ( Trem2 ) as genes significantly correlated with Arg1 expression in the TAM and Mreg cell populations ( Figures 4 C and S6 C–S6E).
Recent discoveries establish the TREM2 receptor as a major pathology-induced myeloid cell signaling hub that activates immune remodeling in response to tissue damage ( Ulland and Colonna, 2018 53. Ulland, T.K. ∙ Colonna, M. TREM2 — a key player in microglial biology and Alzheimer disease Nat. Rev. Neurol. 2018; 14 :667-675 Crossref Scopus (394) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zheng et al., 2018 61. Zheng, H. ∙ Cheng, B. ∙ Li, Y. ... TREM2 in Alzheimer’s Disease: Microglial Survival and Energy Metabolism Front. Aging Neurosci. 2018; 10 :395 Crossref Scopus (66) PubMed Google Scholar ). Trem2 has been shown to orchestrate immunosuppressive, phagocytosis, and survival functions in myeloid cells associated with neurodegenerative and metabolic pathologies ( Deczkowska et al., 2020 12.

A Unique Microglia Type Associated with Restricting Development of Alzheimer’s Disease Cell. 2017; 169 :1276-1290.e17 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2879) PubMed Google Scholar ). To validate our findings, we next used the surface markers identified in scRNA-seq to enrich for the myeloid suppressive cells expressing high Arg1 protein and then measured their Arg1 and Trem2 mRNA quantities using qPCR. We used antibodies targeting Pdpn, Cx3cr1, and Gpnmb because they defined distinct markers for the two major Arg1 high subpopulations, whereas Ly6C + cells were correlated with the Arg1 low subsets. Consistent with our data, qPCR analysis of Pdpn, Gpnmb, and Cx3cr1 populations detected higher expression levels of Arg1 and Trem2 transcripts compared with the Ly6C + population ( Figures 4 D and 4E).
To further validate our results, we analyzed CD45 + CD11b + cells from MCA205 mouse tumors stained for the same cell surface markers depicting the different Arg1 + and Arg1 − intra-tumoral myeloid populations within the TME. We validated that Pdpn high and Ly6C high subsets were clearly detectable as separate populations by flow cytometry. Furthermore, the Pdpn high myeloid population was strongly associated with Cx3cr1 high and Gpnmb high markers ( Figure 4 F). To further devise a sorting strategy and characterize the Arg1 + and Arg1 − intra-tumoral myeloid populations, we used CyTOF mass cytometry to profile the intra-tumoral immune populations of MCA205. Analysis of a large set of proteins defined by our single-cell data revealed similar results as those observed in our FACS analysis ( Figure 4 G; STAR Methods ). The CyTOF results further confirmed our transcriptional findings, defining two distinct myeloid populations marked by Pdpn and Ly6C. In line with the single-cell data, the Pdpn population overlapped with expression of Cx3cr1, Trem2, Arg1, and CD206 (Mrc1) ( Figures 4 G and S6 F). In summary, INs-seq analysis of Arg1 expression defined the molecular characteristics of two distinct myeloid populations that share the expression of Arg1 and the Trem2 receptor: a TAM population and an Mreg cell population.
To confirm our INs-seq tumor map and gain deeper molecular characterization of the tumor-associated myeloid populations, we sorted immune cells (CD45 + ) from MCA205 tumors for MARS-seq analysis. We used the MetaCell algorithm to identify homogeneous groups of cells from scRNA-seq data, resulting in a map of 115 metacells ( Figure S7 A; Table S5). We removed the lymphoid, granulocyte, and DC populations and separately analyzed only myeloid populations ( Figure 5 A). Similar to our INs-seq tumor map, Arg1 expression was highly correlated with Trem2 and Pdpn expression, whereas Ly6C , Ccr2 , and Plac8 represented Arg1 − myeloid populations ( Figure 5 B). Consistent with our analysis, the Arg1 + Trem2 + populations can be subdivided into two distinct programs: TAMs, characterized by mature macrophages markers such as Cx3cr1 , Apoe , and C1qa , and Mreg cells, monocyte-like cells expressing Gpnmb , Il7r , and several hypoxia-related genes such as Hilpda , Hmox1 , and Vegfa ( Figures 5 B–5D). We found multiple TFs that correlated with the myeloid suppressive programs, including known regulators and several TFs that have not been associated previously with myeloid suppressive cells ( Figure 5 E). We trained a lasso-regularized, cross-validated linear model ( STAR Methods ), predicting the different programs with high accuracy based on expression of TFs only ( Figures 5 E and S7 C). We found Maf , Cebpb , Atf3 , and Hif1a to be potential Mreg cell regulators and Spi1 and Hif1a for TAMs. The monocytes cluster enriched with type I interferon signaling showed TF enrichment for Stat1 , Irf9 , and Irf7 .
To better understand the regulatory mechanisms of Arg1 + cells, we further analyzed the single-cell data, seeking potential regulators that may perturb accumulation of myeloid suppressive cells. Among them, we identified Trem2 as a promising target. Trem2 was highly correlated with Arg1 + myeloid cells and has been shown to promote myeloid cell proliferation, survival, and immune suppression in various pathologies ( Gervois and Lambrichts, 2019 16. Gervois, P. ∙ Lambrichts, I. The emerging role of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 as a target for immunomodulation in ischemic stroke Front. Immunol. 2019; 10 :1668 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhong et al., 2017 62. Zhong, L. ∙ Chen, X.F. ∙ Wang, T. ... Soluble TREM2 induces inflammatory responses and enhances microglial survival J. Exp. Med. 2017; 214 :597-607 Crossref Scopus (234) PubMed Google Scholar ). Trem2 has also been shown to be expressed in myeloid cells in human tumors, and its deficiency in a mouse tumor model abrogates tumor growth ( Tang et al., 2019 49. Tang, W. ∙ Lv, B. ∙ Yang, B. ... TREM2 acts as a tumor suppressor in hepatocellular carcinoma by targeting the PI3K/Akt/β-catenin pathway Oncogenesis. 2019; 8 :9 Crossref Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhang et al., 2018 60. Zhang, X. ∙ Wang, W. ∙ Li, P. ... High TREM2 expression correlates with poor prognosis in gastric cancer Hum. Pathol. 2018; 72 :91-99 Crossref Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ). To define the function of Trem2 in the TME, we first screened for Trem2-expressing macrophage cell lines. We identified N9 cells as a relevant Trem2-expressing model and used CRISPR-Cas9 and Trem2 -specific guide RNA to generate a Trem2-deficient N9 model ( STAR Methods ). To evaluate the functional effect of Trem2 on T cell activation, we co-cultured N9 or Trem2-deficient N9 cells in a 1:5 ratio with cell proliferation dye-labeled splenic naive CD8+ T cells activated with α-CD3 and α-CD28 ( Figures S7 D and S7E). CD8+ T cells co-cultured with N9 cells demonstrated significant suppression of CD8+ T cell proliferation comparable with, if not more suppressive, than addition of transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) to the medium. CD8+ T cells co-cultured with Trem2-deficient N9 cells showed a subtle effect on CD8+ T cell proliferation. This suggests that, at least in cell culture models, Trem2 plays an important role in regulation of immunosuppressive activity of myeloid cells.
To evaluate Trem2 activity in vivo , we compared MCA205 tumor growth in Trem2 +/+ (wild-type [WT]) and Trem2 −/− mice and observed a significant reduction in tumor volume in Trem2 −/− mice ( Figures 5 F and S7 F). To further study the role of Trem2 on the intra-tumoral immune environment, we performed scRNA-seq of immune cells derived from MCA205-bearing mice from a Trem2 +/+ and Trem2 −/− background, capturing a total of 15,808 QC-positive cells. Focusing on Trem2-expressing myeloid cells, we found a significant reduction in the Mreg cell population in the TME (p = 0.0096, two-sample t test) together with an increase in the TAM population in Trem2 −/− mice compared with the WT ( Figures 5 G and S7 B). Examination of the lymphoid compartment in WT and Trem2 −/− mice revealed a notable decrease in CD8 + dysfunctional T cells (expressing PD-1 and Tim-3) along with a significant expansion of the natural killer (NK) and cytotoxic T cell populations ( Figure 5 G; p = 0.0085, two-sample t test). To assess the functional effect of the different tumor-infiltrating myeloid populations on activated T lymphocyte proliferation, we used a T cell proliferation assay. Tumor-infiltrating myeloid populations (Mreg cells, TAMs, and Ccr2 + ) were isolated, sorted by FACS, and co-cultured with cell proliferation dye-labeled splenic isolated naive CD8 T cells activated with α-CD3 and α-CD28. Although CD8 + T cells co-cultured with intra-tumoral Ccr2 + monocytes showed full proliferative behavior with no indication of suppression, we observed a considerable reduction in proliferation of activated CD8 + T cells that were co-cultured with Cx3cr1 + TAMs and an even more dominant suppression phenotype when cultured with Gpnmb + Mreg cells ( Figures 5 H and S7 G). Our results demonstrate that Arg1 + tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells contain two molecularly distinct myeloid populations: TAMs and Mreg cells. Trem2 knockout mice show that, although both populations are defined by Trem2 expression, only the Mreg cell populations are affected by Trem2 ablation. Altogether, we show that Trem2 deficiency leads to significant reduction in immunosuppression in a macrophage cell line and in the TME in vivo , which entails reactivation of the immune system, dramatically inhibiting tumor growth.

Section: Discussion

Although scRNA-seq technologies are major drivers in research and discovery, addition of other layers of cellular information, ranging from DNA to lineage, chromatin accessibility, surface protein expression, and perturbations, has recently had important effects on many fields, especially when these modalities are combined with the cellular transcriptome ( Giladi and Amit, 2018 17. Giladi, A. ∙ Amit, I. Single-Cell Genomics: A Stepping Stone for Future Immunology Discoveries Cell. 2018; 172 :14-21 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (127) PubMed Google Scholar ; Stuart and Satija, 2019 47. Stuart, T. ∙ Satija, R. Integrative single-cell analysis Nat. Rev. Genet. 2019; 20 :257-272 Crossref Scopus (818) PubMed Google Scholar ). Combining massively parallel scRNA-seq with intracellular protein measurements may enable capturing additional layers of information that have not been currently profiled at this resolution and scale, including TFs, signaling activity, and metabolism. Here, we developed a broadly applicable technology for profiling integrated single-cell transcriptional, signaling, TF, and metabolism maps (INs-seq).
We successfully applied INs-seq to investigate the molecular programs associated with distinct intracellular proteins and showed that our unique technology is applicable for single-cell profiling of diverse intracellular modalities ranging from TFs to signaling and metabolic pathways in vitro and in vivo . Our current focus of immune characterization is dependent on cell surface markers that outline cell lineages. The INs-seq technology enables us to investigate intracellular signals that may not be congruent with cell lineages and, hence, adds additional and important layers of signaling and metabolic pathways and shows their effect on immune function in diverse microenvironments. We profiled in vitro myeloid cells according to post-translational modification of the pp38 MAPK, a downstream signaling component of LPS TLR4 stimulation, and uncovered differential activation of DCs versus monocytes. We also demonstrate the potential of INs-seq to characterize novel immune cell populations based on single-cell profiling of TF circuits. So far, such efforts could only be approached using engineered TF reporter transgenic animal models, which have been an instrumental for discovery of novel immune populations. INs-seq T cell TF maps defined the interplay between TCF7 and ID2 in controlling the CD8 T cell cellular state and identified the molecular profile of effector and CM T cells in PBMC. Additionally, profiling of FOXP3 + immune cells defined the unique molecular signature of Treg cells from different tissues, including tumor-resident and human blood Treg cells.
Finally, we analyzed suppressive metabolic circuits within the TME by direct targeting of Arg1 + myeloid cells. We found two distinct populations of Arg1 + Trem2 + cells in tumor: a TAM population and a population of monocytic regulatory cells characterized by defined surface markers and signaling, including hypoxia. We further demonstrated the immunosuppressive activity of the Trem2 + populations. Our findings identified Trem2 as a marker and important regulator of myeloid suppressive cells. Genetic ablation of Trem2 in mice led to a dramatic decrease in the Mreg cell population with an increase in immune reactivity toward the tumor, including a decrease in dysfunctional CD8 + T cells and an increase in NK and cytotoxic T cells. Our results are starting to define the role of Trem2 in regulating the suppressive nature of myeloid cells in the TME. These results highlight the potential of targeting Trem2 signaling as an effective strategy for reactivation of the immune response toward tumors.
Our experiments also highlight several remaining challenges in the current version of the INs-seq technology. First, combining a large number of intracellular markers will improve our ability to elucidate complete signaling and metabolic pathways. Because of the limited number of currently available fluorophores for FACS, it will be of importance to incorporate oligo-barcoded antibodies into our technology to quantitatively target dozens of proteins simultaneously. Second, although the cluster of differentiation (CD) extracellular markers were effectively developed and validated by the community for FACS analysis over many years, we are still missing such validated markers for intracellular proteins and PTM. Third, following INs-seq fixation, although the general number of RNA molecules is preserved, we still observe some RNA fragmentation, resulting in a lower median of molecules captured per cell in the scRNA-seq protocols. Reducing this fragmentation as well as including shorter molecules in the final single-cell library will further improve the quality of the INs-seq data.
Profiling cell populations within the framework of traditional cell lineages as defined by CD markers can potentially overlook important functional heterogeneity. Distinct lineages may share the same metabolic activities and signaling and, therefore, function in a coherent manner. Our application of INs-seq is not limited to classical cell markers; rather, this technology characterizes cellular states through the lens of TF profiles and intracellular signaling activity, bringing the potential of associating the epigenetic, signaling, and metabolic activity landscape onto the lineage manifold. This conceptual novelty of incorporating intracellular factors in addition to the transcriptome is also not restricted to the study of physiological behaviors of cells and tissues and may serve as an engine for analyzing perturbations, such as CRISPR genetic screens, drug or antibody screening, and their outcomes in different environments and pathologies. The robustness of INs-seq across a large variety of modalities and cells from different origins, including human clinical samples, demonstrates its potential to investigate a vast number of unresolved biological questions.

Wild-type (WT) mice (8 weeks, females, C57BL/6) were purchased from Harlan and housed in the Weizmann Institute animal facility. Trem2 −/− knock-out (KO) mice (8 weeks, females) were kindly provided by Prof. Marco Colonna ( Turnbull et al., 2006 52. Turnbull, I.R. ∙ Gilfillan, S. ∙ Cella, M. ... Cutting edge: TREM-2 attenuates macrophage activation J. Immunol. 2006; 177 :3520-3524 Crossref Scopus (527) PubMed Google Scholar ). Foxp3-RFP (Tg(Foxp3-RFP,-cre)) mice were kindly provided by Dr. Jakub Abramsaon (10 weeks, females). Mice were provided with food and water ad libitum and housed under a strict 12 hr light-dark cycle. All experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
8 weeks female C57BL/6 mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. To isolate the bone marrow, femora and tibiae from one leg were removed, cleaned from flesh, and flushed with C10 culture medium (RPMI-1640 supplemented with 15% serum, 1% x100 non-essential amino acids , 10mM HEPES buffer, 1mM sodium pyruvate , 2mM L-glutamine, and 50 μM b-mercaptoethanol) using a G21 needle syringe. Flushed bone marrow was filtered through a 70-μm cell strainer and spun down in a cold centrifuge at 300xg for 5 min. Cells were re-suspended in 250 μL RBC lysis solution (Sigma) per leg and incubated for 5 min at room temperature, washed, and resuspended in pre-warmed C10 medium. Cultures were set by plating 2x10 6 cells in 10mL C10 supplemented with 20 ng/ml GM-CSF in a 100 mm non-tissue culture plate, and incubated under standard culture conditions (37°C, 5% CO2) (Day 0). On day 2 another 10 mL C10 medium supplemented with 20 ng/ml GM-CSF was added. On day 5, three quarter of the medium was replaced with fresh C10 medium supplemented with 20 ng/ml GM-CSF. On day 7, another 5 mL of C10 medium supplemented with 10 ng/ml GM-CSF. On day 8, non-adherent and loosely adherent cells in the culture supernatant were harvested by gentle washing and re-cultured in a fresh C10 medium supplemented with 10 ng/ml GM-CSF in new non-tissue culture plates and used as starting material for all BMDC experiments.
MCA-205 fibrosarcoma cell lines were kindly provided by Sergio Quezada group at UCL cancer institute, London, UK. Cells were cultured in DMEM (41965-039) medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 1mM sodium pyruvate, 2mM l-glutamine, 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cells were cultured in 100 mm tissue culture plates in an incubator with humidified air and 5% CO2 at 37°C. Cell lines were validated for lack of mycoplasma infection using primers for mycoplasma-specific 16S rRNA gene region (EZPCR Mycoplasma Kit; Biological Industries).
Blood was taken from 3 healthy peripheral blood donors (Donor 1: male, 32; Donor 2: male, 33; Donor 3: male, 26). The peripheral blood collecting samples is part of the (0220-15-TLV) approval. PBMCs were purified from fresh blood samples by sterile density gradient separation by density centrifugation media (Ficoll-Paque (GE Healthcare Life Sciences)) in a 1:1 ratio. Centrifugation (460 g, 25 min,) was performed at 10°C, and the mononuclear cells were carefully aspirated and washed with ice-cold FACS buffer, followed by red blood lysis (Sigma-Aldrich) for 5 min at 4°C and washing with ice cold FACS buffer.
Recommended fluorophores to use for both extracellular and intracellular staining with INs-seq protocol: Af488, Af647, ef450, ef660, APC, FITC, Pacific blue, BV711.
Cells or tissue from in vitro and in vivo experiments respectively were dissociated into single cell suspension and washed with 10 mL cold PBS. Cells were stained in ice cold washing buffer (−/− Dulbecco’s Phosphate Buffered Saline (Biological industries), 0.5% BSA (MP-Biomedicals), 2mM EDTA (Merck) with fluorophores conjugated antibodies (final concentration of 5 μg/mL) on ice for 30 minutes in the dark.
Surface-stained cells were washed in 10 mL washing buffer and centrifuged at 400 g for 5 minutes. Cell pellet (1x10 ˆ6 – 5x10 ˆ6 cells) was resuspended in 1 volume (100 μl) of cold PBS (0.4U/μL RNasin® Plus RNase Inhibitor (Promega)). Cell suspension was fixed with 9 volumes (900 μl) of cold 100% methanol (Bio-Lab) (pre-chilled to −20°C) for 10 minutes on ice in the dark. To avoid cell clumping, methanol was added in drops, while gently vortexing the cell suspension.
Fixed cells were pelleted at 900 g for 3 minutes right after fixation. Methanol-PBS solution was completely discarded. Cell pellet was washed (not resuspended) twice with ice-cold PBS (0.4U/μL RNasin® Plus RNase Inhibitor) without breaking the pellet, for complete removal of methanol leftovers. Cell pellet was resuspended in 100 μL of enzyme blocking buffer containing ammonium sulfate (Thermo Fisher) solution (0.05M EDTA (Sigma), 0.8U/μL RNasin® Plus RNase Inhibitor, pH of 5.2) and kept on ice for 10 minutes in the dark.
To wash enzyme blocking buffer solution, 1 mL washing buffer (0.4U/μL RNasin® Plus RNase inhibitor) was added, cells then were pelleted at 900 g for 3 minutes. To completely remove enzyme blocking buffer, cell pellet was washed twice with ice-cold washing buffer (0.4U/μL RNasin® Plus RNase inhibitor) without re-suspension. Cell pellet was then incubated in the dark for 20 minutes with 100 μl intracellular staining buffer (−/− Dulbecco’s Phosphate Buffered Saline (Biological industries), 0.5% BSA (MP biochemical), 2M EDTA (Sigma) with the desired intracellular antibody). At the end of the incubation, 1 mL washing buffer (0.4U/μL RNasin® Plus RNase inhibitor) was added on top of the 100 μl intracellular staining buffer, cells were pelleted at 900 g for 3 minutes. Cell pellet was resuspended in 1 mL preservation buffer, filtered with 70 um nylon mesh and kept on ice until cell sorting.

Cells were stained in ice cold washing buffer (−/− Dulbecco’s Phosphate Buffered Saline (Biological industries), 0.5% BSA (MP-Biomedicals), 2mM EDTA (Merck)) with fluorophores conjugated antibodies (final concentration of 5 μg/mL) on ice for 30 minutes in the dark.
Methanol based cell fixation protocol: adopted from Alles et al. (2017) 1. Alles, J. ∙ Karaiskos, N. ∙ Praktiknjo, S.D. ... Cell fixation and preservation for droplet-based single-cell transcriptomics BMC Biol. 2017; 15 :44 Crossref Scopus (149) PubMed Google Scholar . Surface-stained cells were washed in 10 mL washing buffer and centrifuged at 400 g for 5 minutes. Cells were handled in regular microcentrifuge tubes to minimize cell loss and kept cold at all times. Cells were resuspended in 100 μL of ice-cold PBS. To avoid cell clumping, 9 volumes (900 μl) of methanol (pre-chilled to –20°C) were added dropwise, while gently mixing or vortexing the cell suspension (final concentration: 90% methanol in PBS). The methanol-fixed cells were kept on ice for a minimum of 15 min. For rehydration, cells were pelleted at 900 g for 4 min, rehydrated in PBS (0.01% BSA, 1U/μl RNasin® Plus RNase inhibitor) pelleted, centrifuged, resuspended again in PBS (0.01% BSA, 1U/μl RNase inhibitor) and filtered with 70 um nylon mesh and kept on ice until cell sorting.
PFA based – Surface-strained cells were washed in 10 mL washing buffer and centrifuged at 400 g for 5 minutes. True-Nuclear Transcription Factor Buffer Set commercial kit was used according to the published protocol. Cells were filtered with 70 um nylon mesh and kept on ice until cell sorting.
DSP based cell fixation protocol: was adopted from Gerlach et al. (2019) 15. Gerlach, J.P. ∙ van Buggenum, J.A.G. ∙ Tanis, S.E.J. ... Combined quantification of intracellular (phospho-)proteins and transcriptomics from fixed single cells Sci. Rep. 2019; 9 :1469 Crossref Scopus (59) PubMed Google Scholar . Surface-srained cells were washed in 10 mL washing buffer and centrifuged at 400 g for 5 minutes. Cells were fixed using a combination of 2.5 mM DSP (Thermo Scientific) and 2.5 mM SPDP (Thermo Scientific) in DMSO for 45 minutes in 200 mM Sodium Phosphate Buffered Saline pH 8.4 (1M stock solution of Sodium-Phosphate buffer includes 1M NaH2PO4 (Sodium phosphate monobasic (Sigma) and 1M Na2HPO4 (Sodium phosphate dibasic (Sigma)) solutions), and 150mM NaCl (Sigma). After fixative quenching with 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl the cells were blocked and permeabilized using 0.5X Protein Free Blocking Buffer (PFBB, Thermo Scientific) in PBS, 0.5 U/μl RNasin® Plus RNase and 0.1% Triton X-100. Next, cells were stained overnight with 0.5 X PFBB in PBS containing 2 U/μl RNasin® Plus RNase inhibitor, 0.1% Triton and 250 ng/μl of the desired intracellular antibody. After staining, the cells were gently washed 6 times with 10 ml 0.1X PFBB in PBS, filtered with 70 um nylon mesh and kept on ice until cell sorting.
Day 9 culture BMDCs were fixed according to the different fixation protocol guidelines including INS-seq (as described above), and stained for Cd11c. 5000 cells from each protocol were sorted directly into 40 μl of lysis binding buffer (Invitrogen). mRNA was captured with 12 μL of Dynabeads oligo(dT) (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer protocol. For DSP samples only, mRNA was reverse cross-linked by incubation with 6 mM dNTP, 150 mM Tris pH 8, 90 mM DTT, 0.1% Triton, 6 U/μl RNAsin Plus for 45 minutes at 25 °C, followed by 5 minutes at 65 °C and then cooled to 4 °C. For all fixation protocols each half of the mRNA material was either reverse transcribed or reverse transcribed and amplified (14 cycles) in the same reaction (RT-PCR). cDNA or amplified cDNA were diluted (1:40) and quantified in qPCR using mouse Actb primers.
mRNA from cells sorted in to lysis/binding buffer was captured with 12 μL of Dynabeads oligo(dT) (Invitrogen), washed, and eluted at 85°C with 10 μL of 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). mRNA was reverse transcribed using SuperScript II (ThermoFisher) and cDNA was diluted 1:40 for qPCR measurement using the different genes primers (See Table S7 ).
Spleen was harvested from 8 weeks’ females C57BL/6 mice, mashed through 100uM cell strainer and washed with ice-cold MACS buffer. cells were centrifuged at 300 g, 5 min, 4°C and suspended in red blood lysis buffer (Sigma-Aldrich) and DNase (0.33U/ml, Sigma-Adrich), incubated for 5min at room temperature, washed twice with cold PBS, passed through a 40 μm mesh filter, centrifuged at 300 g, 5 min, 4°C and then resuspended in ice cold FACS buffer. Spleenocytes were either sorted fresh or INs-seq fixed and then sorted, for qPCR analysis of Actb.
CD45+, TCR-β+, CD11b- and Foxp3+ (by endogenous Foxp3-RFP or anti Foxp3-APC conjugated antibody) cells were isolated from cervical lymph nodes or MCA-205 fiborosarcoma tumors from Foxp3-RFP 10 weeks, female mice.
8 weeks, female mice were inoculated intradermally (i.d.) with 5x10 5 MCA-205 cells suspended in 100 μL PBS on their right flank. At day 19, tumors volume was measured using a caliper. Tumor volume was assessed by measuring two diameters and calculated using the formula X 2 × Y × 0.52 (where X , smaller diameter and Y, larger diameter).
Tumor bearing mice were sacrificed at 10 and 19 days after tumor cell inoculation. The tumors underwent mechanical (gentleMACS™ C tube, Miltenyi Biotec Inc., San Diego, CA) and enzymatic digestion (0.1mg/ml DNase type I (Roche), and 1mg/ml Collagenase IV (Worthington) in RPMI-1640) for 15 min at 37°C. Cells then filtered through 100μm cell strainer, washed with ice cold sorting buffer, centrifuged (5 min, 4°C, 300 g), and stained with fluorophores conjugated antibodies.
Following staining, cells were washed and resuspended in cold washing buffer (0.5% BSA and 2 mM EDTA in PBS), stained with fluorophore conjugated anti-mouse CD45 antibody, and filtered through a 70-μm strainer. Before sorting, cells were stained with propidium iodide to exclude dead/dying cells. Cell sorting was performed using a BD FACSAria Fusion flow cytometer (BD Biosciences), gating for CD45+ cells after exclusion of dead cells and doublets. Single cells were sorted into 384-well capture plates containing 2 mL of lysis solution and barcoded poly(T) reverse-transcription (RT) primers for scRNA-seq as described previously ( Keren-Shaul et al., 2019 28. Keren-Shaul, H. ∙ Kenigsberg, E. ∙ Jaitin, D.A. ... MARS-seq2.0: an experimental and analytical pipeline for indexed sorting combined with single-cell RNA sequencing Nature Protocols. 2019; 14 :1841-1862 Crossref Scopus (161) PubMed Google Scholar ). Immediately after sorting, plates were spun down to ensure cell immersion into the lysis solution, snap-frozen on dry ice and stored at -80°C until further processing. Cells were analyzed using BD FACSDIVA software (BD Bioscience) and FlowJo software (FlowJo, LLC).
Mouse tumor samples were processed as previously described to achieve single cell suspension. Tumor infiltrating immune cell were enriched using CD45 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotech). Cells were washed with CyTOF PBS and stained with Cisplatin viability stain for 1 min, washed twice and stained with extracellular antibodies cocktail (resource table) at RT for 30 min. After extracellular staining, cells were washed twice and fixed using the CyTOF Nuclear Antigen Staining Buffer working solution [dilute the 4X Nuclear Antigen Staining Buffer Concentrate (1 part) with Nuclear Antigen Staining Buffer Diluent (3 parts)] for 30 minutes while pipetting every 10 min. Fixed cells were permed by using the CyTOF Perm-S buffer and stained with Intracellular antibodies cocktail for 30 min. Fixed cells were washed twice and resuspended in 4% Formaldehyde (Thermo Fisher) and kept at 4°C over night until acquisition day. Stained and Fixed cells were analyzed using the CyTOF 3 (Helios) system (FLUIDIGM). Data was processed using Cytobank.
Cell populations were sorted using BD FACSAria Fusion flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Prior to sorting, all samples were filtered through a 70-μm nylon mesh. Samples were CD11b+Gpnmb+/Pdpn+/Lyc6+ or CD11c+ MHCII high/mid or CD45+CD11b+Arg1+ or CD45+. 5,000-10,000 cells were sorted into a low-bind Eppendorf tube containing 40 μL of lysis/binding buffer (Invitrogen). Immediately after sorting, tubes were spun down to ensure cell immersion into the lysis solution, snap frozen on dry ice, and stored at –80°C until processed.
Fresh or INs-seq-fixed cells were FACS sorted into 0.04% PBS-BSA buffer or INs-seq collection buffer respectively. Cells were stained with trypan blue and counted using light microscopy and then loaded onto a 10x Chromium microfluidics system according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. scRNA-seq 5′ gene expression (GEX) libraries were generated using the 10X Genomics Chromium Single Cell 5′ Kit v2 and the 10x Chromium Controller (10x Genomics) according to the 10x Single Cell 5′ v2 protocol guidelines. The 5′ mRNA library was sequenced with Illumina’s NextSeq 500 using 75 paired-end reads.
Single-cell libraries were prepared as previously described (Keren-Shaul et al., 2019). In brief, mRNA from cells sorted into cell capture plates were barcoded and converted into cDNA and pooled using and automated pipeline. The pooled sample is then linearly amplified by T7 in vitro transcription, and the resulting RNA is fragmented and converted into sequencing-ready library by tagging the samples with pool barcodes and illumina sequences during ligation, RT, and PCR. Each pool of cells was tested for library quality and concentration is assessed as described. Overall, barcoding was done on three levels: cell barcodes allow attribution of each sequence read to its cell of origin, thus enabling pooling; unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) allow tagging each original molecule in order to avoid amplification bias; and plate barcodes allow elimination of the batch effect.
Spleen was isolated from 11 weeks WT female (C57BL/6) mouse and was dissociated into single-cell suspension and filtered through 70μm cell strainer. Red blood cells were lysed with RBC lysis buffer (Sigma). Splenocytes were passed over CD8 T cell enrichment LS column (Miltenyi). Enriched CD8 T cells were labeled with Cell Proliferation dye eFluor™ 450 (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s guidelines and co cultured with sterilely sorted intratumoral (MCA205) Cd11b+ Gpnmb+ or Cd11b+ Cxc3r1+ or Cd11b+ Ccr2+ cells separately in a 1:1 ratio. T cells were then activated with CD3/CD28 Dynabeads (Thermo Fisher) according to the kit guidelines. The cells were co-cultured in TC 96 well plate round bottom (Conring) in C10 medium containing recombinant IL-2 (5 ng/ml) and 100 U/mL penicillin/streptomycin. For control, T cells were solo-cultured with or without activation. Cells were harvested after 48 hours, cell suspension was stained with CD8-APC/Cy7 to gate only T cells and T cell proliferation was measured in FACS analysis by Cell Proliferation dye eFluor™ 450 dilution. For N9 murine microglia line experiment, activated CD8 T cells were co cultured with either WT N9, Trem2 knockout N9 cells (5:1), or 50ng/ml TGFb, and were incubated for 48h in 37C, 5% CO 2 incubator. Cells were analyzed for proliferation using LSRII FACS analyzer (BD).
For single guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting Trem2 expression, we used the lentiviral lentiGuide-mCherry backbone vector ( Jaitin et al., 2016 24. Jaitin, D.A. ∙ Weiner, A. ∙ Yofe, I. ... Dissecting Immune Circuits by Linking CRISPR-Pooled Screens with Single-Cell RNA-Seq Cell. 2016; 167 :1883-1896.e15 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (501) PubMed Google Scholar ). LentiGuide-mCherry vector was digested with the restriction enzyme FastDigest Esp3I (Thermo Fisher Scientific, FD0454) and guide RNAs (See Table S7 ) were inserted by Gibson assembly reaction.
Trem2-guide RNA lentiviral particles were produced by transfecting 293T cells together with packaging plasmids, using the jetPEI transfection reagent (Polyplus-transfection) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and following the standard lentivirus production protocol ( Klages et al., 2000 31. Klages, N. ∙ Zufferey, R. ∙ Trono, D. A stable system for the high-titer production of multiply attenuated lentiviral vectors Mol. Ther. 2000; 2 :170-176 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (188) PubMed Google Scholar ). Media was replaced with RPMI medium without additives 18 hours post transfection, and media containing virus particles were collected 48 and 72 hours post transfection.
Murine microglia N9 cells (kindly provided by Prof. Frenkel D, TAU, Israel), were stably infected with CAS9 nuclease expressing lentivirus (Addgene, 52962-LV) and selected using 10 μg/ml Blastocytidin antibiotic. Cas9 expressing N9 were further infected with a mix of 4 sgRNA targeting Trem2 expressing lentivirus, followed by single cell colony isolation. Trem2 knockout was validated by qPCR (see Table S7 ) and western blot.
Membrane lysates were prepared as previously described ( Schlepckow et al., 2020 43. Schlepckow, K. ∙ Monroe, K.M. ∙ Kleinberger, G. ... Enhancing protective microglial activities with a dual function TREM2 antibody to the stalk region EMBO Mol. Med. 2020; 12 :e11227 Crossref Scopus (154) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cell supernatants were collected, centrifuged (10 min at 1400 rpm) and filtrated (0.45 μm). Lysates (50 μg) and supernatants (40 μl) were separated by standard 12% SDS–PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (ThermoFisher Scientific). Analysis was further performed according to standard procedure using mTrem-2 antibody (Abcam #Ab86491), appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibody and ECL visualization.
The Cell Ranger Single Software Suite v.3.1.0 was used to perform sample alignment, de-multiplexing and UMI counting using the default parameters. The complete spreadsheet of the sequencing metrics is presented in the Supplemental Information (See Table S6 ). A total of 97,257 single cells consisting of 20 samples (5 Fresh and 15 INs-seq samples) were collected, with the number of cells recovered per samples ranging from 343 to 9507. The mean reads per cells varied from 13,480 and 353,472 with median UMI of 561 to 8092 per cell. Low-quality cells were discarded if the number of expressed genes was smaller than 300. Cells were also removed if their mitochondrial gene expression were larger than 10 percent.
For processing of both fresh and INs-seq scRNA-seq data, we used Seurat R package version 3.0. First, we performed filtering of the cells removing cells with less than 300 genes expressed or fraction of mitochondrial gene expression above 10 percent of total UMIs. Next, data for paired fresh and INs-seq samples were normalized using the NormalizeData function and integrated with correction for methods effects across datasets using FindIntegrationAnchors function. We performed Louvain clustering and dimensionality reduction using UMAP algorithm. Marker genes for each cluster have been identified using FindAllMarkers function and Wilcoxon test.
scRNA-seq libraries (pooled at equimolar concentration) were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 at a median sequencing depth of ∼40,000 reads per cell. Sequences were mapped to the mouse (mm10). Demultiplexing and filtering was performed as previously described ( Jaitin et al., 2014 23. Jaitin, D.A. ∙ Kenigsberg, E. ∙ Keren-Shaul, H. ... Massively parallel single-cell RNA-seq for marker-free decomposition of tissues into cell types Science. 2014; 343 :776-779 Crossref Scopus (1300) PubMed Google Scholar ), with the following adaptations: Mapping of reads was performed using HISAT (version 0.1.6); reads with multiple mapping positions were excluded. Reads were associated with genes if they were mapped to an exon, using the ensembl gene annotation database (embl release 90). Exons of different genes that shared a genomic position on the same strand were considered as a single gene with a concatenated gene symbol. The level of spurious unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) in the data were estimated by using statistics on empty MARS-seq wells, and excluded rare cases with estimated noise > 5% (median estimated noise over all experiments was 2%).
We used the R package “MetaCell” ( Baran et al., 2019 5. Baran, Y. ∙ Bercovich, A. ∙ Sebe-Pedros, A. ... MetaCell: analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data using K-nn graph partitions Genome Biol. 2019; 20 :206 Crossref Scopus (167) PubMed Google Scholar ) to analyze data from Figures 4 and 5 . We removed specific mitochondrial genes, immunoglobulin genes, and genes linked with poorly supported transcriptional models (annotated with the prefix “Rp-”). We then filtered cells with less than 400 UMIs. Gene features were selected using the parameter Tvm = 0.3 and a minimum total UMI count > 50. We subsequently performed hierarchical clustering of the correlation matrix between those genes (filtering genes with low coverage and computing correlation using a down-sampled UMI matrix) and selected the gene clusters that contained anchor genes. We used K = 100, 750 bootstrap iterations and otherwise standard parameters. Metacells were annotated by applying a straightforward analysis of known cell type marker genes (e.g., Ear2, Cx3cr1 , Arg1 , Trem2 , Cd3d, Cd79b , and more). Subsets of Monocytes and Macrophages in Figure 5were obtained by hierarchical clustering of the confusion matrix and supervised analysis of enriched genes in homogeneous groups of metacells.
In Tables S4 and S5 , we refer to the log2 of a metacell’s footprint, which is the gene-wise average UMI count per metacell normalized by the median UMI count across all metacells ( Baran et al., 2019 5. Baran, Y. ∙ Bercovich, A. ∙ Sebe-Pedros, A. ... MetaCell: analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data using K-nn graph partitions Genome Biol. 2019; 20 :206 Crossref Scopus (167) PubMed Google Scholar ).
