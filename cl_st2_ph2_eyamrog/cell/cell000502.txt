Title: A defective viral genome strategy elicits broad protective immunity against respiratory viruses


Abstract: Summary

RNA viruses generate defective viral genomes (DVGs) that can interfere with replication of the parental wild-type virus. To examine their therapeutic potential, we created a DVG by deleting the capsid-coding region of poliovirus. Strikingly, intraperitoneal or intranasal administration of this genome, which we termed eTIP1, elicits an antiviral response, inhibits replication, and protects mice from several RNA viruses, including enteroviruses, influenza, and SARS-CoV-2. While eTIP1 replication following intranasal administration is limited to the nasal cavity, its antiviral action extends non-cell-autonomously to the lungs. eTIP1 broad-spectrum antiviral effects are mediated by both local and distal type I interferon responses. Importantly, while a single eTIP1 dose protects animals from SARS-CoV-2 infection, it also stimulates production of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies that afford long-lasting protection from SARS-CoV-2 reinfection. Thus, eTIP1 is a safe and effective broad-spectrum antiviral generating short- and long-term protection against SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory infections in animal models.

Section: Introduction

RNA viruses pose a continuing worldwide health threat. Each new epidemic, from HIV to influenza to dengue and Zika to SARS-CoV-2, highlights an urgent need for effective antiviral drugs and interventions ( Meganck and Baric, 2021 62. Meganck, R.M. ∙ Baric, R.S. Developing therapeutic approaches for twenty-first-century emerging infectious viral diseases Nat. Med. 2021; 27 :401-410 Google Scholar ). The highly contagious coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) ( Zhu et al., 2020 108. Zhu, N. ∙ Zhang, D. ∙ Wang, W. ..., China Novel Coronavirus Investigating and Research Team A Novel Coronavirus from Patients with Pneumonia in China, 2019 N. Engl. J. Med. 2020; 382 :727-733 Google Scholar ) has caused more than 200 million cases and nearly 5 million deaths, and the numbers are still increasing ( WHO, 2021 99. WHO Coronavirus diseas (COVID-19) 2021 https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus#tab=tab_1 Google Scholar ). Despite development of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines, the virus is still circulating ( Cohen et al., 2021 16. Cohen, C. ∙ Kleynhans, J. ∙ Gottberg, A. ...

A few antivirals and monoclonal antibodies are available for SARS-CoV-2 therapy ( Canedo-Marroquín et al., 2020 9. Canedo-Marroquín, G. ∙ Saavedra, F. ∙ Andrade, C.A. ... SARS-CoV-2: Immune Response Elicited by Infection and Development of Vaccines and Treatments Front. Immunol. 2020; 11 :569760 Google Scholar ; Gonçalves et al., 2021 39.

Lundstrom, K. Coronavirus Pandemic-Therapy and Vaccines Biomedicines. 2020; 8 :109 Google Scholar ), but the high mutation rate of the RNA virus is likely to give rise to resistant variants. Clearly, novel therapeutics with a low risk of drug resistance are essential to combat COVID-19 and future epidemics. Unfortunately, developing broad-spectrum antiviral strategies is extremely challenging ( Geller et al., 2012 35. Geller, R. ∙ Taguwa, S. ∙ Frydman, J.

Tse, L.V. ∙ Meganck, R.M. ∙ Graham, R.L. ... The Current and Future State of Vaccines, Antivirals and Gene Therapies Against Emerging Coronaviruses Front. Microbiol. 2020; 11 :658 Google Scholar ).
One attractive strategy would be to harness the effective antiviral defenses of the host. Viral infections elicit a range of responses that prevent or attenuate most infections. Indeed, even for viruses such as influenza virus or SARS-CoV-2, most infections are asymptomatic ( Cohen et al., 2021 16. Cohen, C. ∙ Kleynhans, J. ∙ Gottberg, A. ... SARS-CoV-2 incidence, transmission and reinfection in a rural and an urban setting: results of the PHIRST-C cohort study, South Africa, 2020-2021 Medrxiv. 2021; Google Scholar ; Lutrick et al., 2021 60.

Zhang, J. ∙ Ding, N. ∙ Song, Y. ... Phylogenomic tracing of asymptomatic transmission in a COVID-19 outbreak Innovation. 2021; 2 :100099 Google Scholar ). However, harnessing these responses is difficult. First, most viruses have mechanisms to inactivate or dampen innate immunity, often at multiple steps of the pathway ( Kikkert, 2020 50. Kikkert, M. Innate Immune Evasion by Human Respiratory RNA Viruses J. Innate Immun. 2020; 12 :4-20 Google Scholar ). Second, direct interventions to induce these responses, such as intravenous administration of interferon, have undesirable side effects, likely because they override the delicate regulatory balance that keeps beneficial innate immunity from damaging tissues ( Guo et al., 2021 41. Guo, K. ∙ Barrett, B.S. ∙ Mickens, K.L. ... Interferon Resistance of Emerging SARS-CoV-2 Variants BioRxiv. 2021; Google Scholar ; Nelemans and Kikkert, 2019 67. Nelemans, T. ∙ Kikkert, M. Viral Innate Immune Evasion and the Pathogenesis of Emerging RNA Virus Infections Viruses. 2019; 11 :961 PubMed Google Scholar ).
The innate immune system evolved tightly regulated mechanisms to protect from viral infection and prevent damage to the host. The challenge is to harness these beneficial responses without triggering detrimental side-effects. Our strategy was based on an unexpected and remarkable observation from early epidemiological studies of the Sabin poliovirus (PV) vaccine. Immunization with attenuated Sabin PV protected from PV infection and also reduced influenza virus morbidity by almost fourfold. It even accelerated healing of genital lesions caused by herpes simplex virus. These benefits were never observed upon immunization with an inactivated PV virus (e.g., Salk vaccine). Importantly, the Sabin vaccine causes none of the severe side-effects of interferon administration ( Chumakov et al., 2020 15. Chumakov, K. ∙ Benn, C.S. ∙ Aaby, P. ... Can existing live vaccines prevent COVID-19? Science. 2020; 368 :1187-1188 Google Scholar , 1991 14. Chumakov, K.M. ∙ Powers, L.B. ∙ Noonan, K.E. ... Correlation between amount of virus with altered nucleotide sequence and the monkey test for acceptability of oral poliovirus vaccine Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1991; 88 :199-203 Google Scholar ). These puzzling observations raise the hypothesis that a non-pathogenic virus or virus-like entity could safely stimulate the host innate antiviral responses.
To test this hypothesis, we developed an engineered virus-like entity, based on a defective viral genome (DVG), and tested its potency as a broad-spectrum antiviral. Due to the high error rate of their RNA-dependent RNA-polymerases, RNA viruses naturally generate genome deletions with various degrees of viability ( Crotty and Andino, 2002 18.

A single mutation in poliovirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase confers resistance to mutagenic nucleotide analogs via increased fidelity Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100 :7289-7294 Google Scholar ). These DVGs are maintained by co-infection with the parental virus ( Dimmock and Easton, 2014 23. Dimmock, N.J. ∙ Easton, A.J.

Defective viral genomes are key drivers of the virus-host interaction Nat. Microbiol. 2019; 4 :1075-1087 Google Scholar ), but lack critical portions of the viral genome and therefore cannot propagate or cause disease on their own. DVGs attenuate replication of their corresponding parental virus in a process known as viral interference, first described in the 1960s ( Huang and Baltimore, 1970 44. Huang, A.S. ∙ Baltimore, D. Defective viral particles and viral disease processes Nature. 1970; 226 :325-327 Google Scholar ; McClure et al., 1980 61. McClure, M.A. ∙ Holland, J.J. ∙ Perrault, J. Generation of defective interfering particles in picornaviruses Virology. 1980; 100 :408-418 Google Scholar ; Vignuzzi and López, 2019 96. Vignuzzi, M. ∙ López, C.B. Defective viral genomes are key drivers of the virus-host interaction Nat. Microbiol. 2019; 4 :1075-1087 Google Scholar ) ( Figure 1 A). These findings led to speculation that DVGs modulate the course of disease, perhaps by outcompeting the full-length virus for cellular resources ( Rezelj et al., 2021 80. Rezelj, V.V. ∙ Carrau, L. ∙ Merwaiss, F. ... Defective viral genomes as therapeutic interfering particles against flavivirus infection in mammalian and mosquito hosts Nat. Commun. 2021; 12 :2290 Google Scholar ; Vignuzzi and López, 2019 96. Vignuzzi, M. ∙ López, C.B. Defective viral genomes are key drivers of the virus-host interaction Nat. Microbiol. 2019; 4 :1075-1087 Google Scholar ). However, the mechanism and therapeutic potential of viral interference are poorly understood.
We engineered a PV-derived DVG that can be delivered by lipid nanoparticles and is highly effective at preventing replication of respiratory viruses, including rhinovirus, influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 in cell and animal models. The DVG blocks viral replication by inducing an antiviral state in the respiratory tract. It can be administered intranasally, as pre- or post-exposure prophylaxis, to protect mice from pathogenic viruses without detrimental side-effects. Indeed, eTIP1 (enteroviral therapeutic interfering particle 1) infectious particles protect even when administered 24–48 h post-infection with SARS-CoV-2, PV, coxsackievirus B3 (CBV3), and influenza virus. Importantly, eTIP1 reduces virus load by several orders of magnitude and also enables generation of neutralizing antibodies against the challenging virus. This enhanced antibody response provides long-term protection from reinfection, lasting weeks after the initial intervention. We suggest that our approach is an effective, non-invasive, broad-spectrum strategy to block viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2.

Section: Results

We engineered a DVG for PV type 1 (PV1) by replacing the entire P1 region, which encodes structural proteins, with GFP ( Figure 1 B). eTIP1 infectious particles were produced using a packaging HeLa cell line that stably expresses the PV1 capsid protein precursor P1 (HelaS3/P1) ( Figure 1 C). Transfection of HeLaS3/P1 with in vitro transcribed eTIP1 RNA generated eTIP1 infectious particles that were amplified by repeated infection of HelaS3/P1. High-titer (>10 8 infectious units [IUs]/mL) were purified by sucrose cushion and gradients to 95% purity, as determined by silver stain-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and negative-staining electron microscopy (EM) ( Figure 1 D). eTIP1s were similar in size to wild-type (WT) PV1 particles (PV1 radius = 27.07 ± 1.02 nm and eTIP1 radius = 27.51 ± 1.01 nm). Purified eTIP1 particles can infect cells, as determined by expression of GFP and immunofluorescence (I.F.) with polio-3A antibody ( Figures 1 E and S1 A). Importantly, eTIP1s cannot spread from cell to cell without a WT PV1 acting as a helper virus ( Dimmock and Easton, 2015 24. Dimmock, N.J. ∙ Easton, A.J. Cloned Defective Interfering Influenza RNA and a Possible Pan-Specific Treatment of Respiratory Virus Diseases Viruses. 2015; 7 :3768-3788 Google Scholar ; Perrault and Semler, 1979 72.

Vignuzzi, M. ∙ López, C.B. Defective viral genomes are key drivers of the virus-host interaction Nat. Microbiol. 2019; 4 :1075-1087 Google Scholar ).
To test the therapeutic potential of eTIP1s, we tested if it could block replication of PV1 and related enteroviruses of clinical importance. To this end, we infected cells with enteroviruses with and without eTIP1s at a ratio of 1:20 (eTIP1 multiplicity of infection [moi] = 1–5). eTIP1s effectively blocked replication of PV1 and other enteroviruses, including enterovirus EV-D68, EV-A71, CVB3, and rhinoviruses ( Figures 1 F and S1 B). Virus replication was inhibited 10- to 1,000-fold, depending on the virus and cell line ( Figure 1 F). To determine if eTIP1 antiviral activity is restricted to the genus of its parental virus, we next examined its activity against an unrelated virus. eTIP1 co-infection at a ratio of 1:50 inhibited influenza A (A/PR8) and SARS-CoV-2 by 100- to 1,000-fold ( Figure 1 F). Antiviral activity was even stronger when eTIP1 was administered 5 h before infection with PV1, A/PR8, or SARS-CoV-2 ( Figure 1 G). These results suggest that the inhibitory activity of eTIP1 does not rely on direct competition for enteroviral proteins, such as the viral capsid or other viral or host factors required for enterovirus replication.
Given the broad-spectrum inhibitory effects of eTIP1s in cell culture, we examined their ability to prevent disease in mice infected with several pathogenic viruses. After intraperitoneal (IP) inoculation of susceptible mice, PV1 replicates and accumulates to high titers in diverse tissues, ultimately reaching the central nervous system (CNS) to cause paralysis and death ( Ida-Hosonuma et al., 2005 46.

Virus Res. 2010; 77 :85-118 Google Scholar ; Xiao et al., 2017 101. Xiao, Y. ∙ Dolan, P.T. ∙ Goldstein, E.F. ... Poliovirus intrahost evolution is required to overcome tissue-specific innate immune responses Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :375 Google Scholar ). Similarly, after intranasal (IN) inoculation, PV1 reaches the CNS rapidly through the olfactory nerve, causing severe disease ( Nagata et al., 2004 66. Nagata, N. ∙ Iwasaki, T. ∙ Ami, Y. ... A poliomyelitis model through mucosal infection in transgenic mice bearing human poliovirus receptor, TgPVR21 Virology. 2004; 321 :87-100 Google Scholar ).
We infected mice by the IP route with high doses of PV1 (10 7 plaque-forming units, pfu) with or without co-inoculation with eTIP1s ( Figure 2 A, i , IP). Under these conditions, eTIP1 significantly attenuated disease and protected 80%–90% of mice from lethal infection. Importantly, co-inoculation of eTIP1s inactivated by UV irradiation did not protect mice from PV1, indicating that the eTIP1s must be replication competent to exert its antiviral properties. This experiment ruled out that protection was conferred by a contaminant introduced in eTIP1 production. eTIP1s also protected animals from disease (weight loss) and death after infection with a non-polio enterovirus, CVB3 ( Figures S2 A and S2B). Next, we determined if eTIP1 protects animals from respiratory infection. IN co-inoculation of PV1 and eTIP1s protected from death ( Figure 2 A, ii ) and reduced PV1 viral loads in spleen and brain over 500-fold ( Figure S1 C).
To determine if eTIP1-induced protection is long lasting, we administered a single IN dose of eTIP1 and challenged the mice with pathogenic PV1 48 h later. While animals inoculated with PV1 alone succumbed to infection, pre-exposure administration of eTIP1 protected 90% of the animals from lethal disease ( Figure 2 B, i ). Post-exposure administration of eTIP1 24 and 48 h after PV1 infection also elicited significant protection ( Figure 2 B, ii ). The protective effects were lost if treatment is initiated 72 h after PV1 infection (not shown). These results indicate that both pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis with eTIP1 protects against IN PV1 infection, preventing severe disease and death. In addition, eTIP1 protected from infection with A/PR8 and CVB3 when administered 24 (A/PR8 and CVB3) ( Figure 2 C, ii , and Figure S1 D) or 48 h (CVB3) after the viral challenge ( Figure 2 C, i ). This indicates that eTIP1 can protect from respiratory infections after a single IN dose.
Our finding that eTIP1s interfere with viral infection in mice supports their use as an antiviral. However, their applicability may be limited by practical considerations such as a requirement for the PV receptor (PVR) to enter target cells and neutralization in vaccinated individuals. We thus tested whether eTIP1 DVG could be delivered by synthetic nanostructured lipid/RNA complexes (herein lipid nanoparticles, or LNPs). LNPs deliver RNA via endocytosis, which is unaffected by pre-existing immunity, and so may be administered as multiple consecutive doses ( Figure 3 A). We chose a cationic lipid formulation that binds well to the phosphate backbone of nucleic acids, and is easy to prepare, non-toxic, and extensively characterized ( Kranz et al., 2016 55. Kranz, L.M. ∙ Diken, M. ∙ Haas, H. ... Systemic RNA delivery to dendritic cells exploits antiviral defence for cancer immunotherapy Nature. 2016; 534 :396-401 Google Scholar ; Scheideler et al., 2020 82. Scheideler, M. ∙ Vidakovic, I. ∙ Prassl, R. Lipid nanocarriers for microRNA delivery Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2020; 226 :104837 Google Scholar ). We find that LNPs protect RNA molecules from hydrolysis and enable eTIP1 delivery to initiate replication at mucosal reparatory surfaces. We confirmed that LNPs deliver synthetic eTIP1 RNA in cell cultures ( Figure S3 A). Then, we compared the site of eTIP1 replication when delivered to mice via IN administration of particles or LNPs. At 24 h post-inoculation, immunohistochemistry of mouse heads and lungs detected eTIP1 replication in epithelial cells within the ethmoid turbinates of the upper respiratory nasal cavity ( Figure 3 B). eTIP1 replication was limited to those tissues, not detected in other regions of the respiratory tract, and observed for only 12–24 h post-inoculation.
We next tested if eTIP1 can be mobilized from the site of inoculation to other tissues by a co-infecting help virus. We co-inoculated highly susceptible mice (IFNAR −/− ) intramuscularly with 200 pfu of PV1 with eTIP1s (50,000 IUs). The high concentration of the initial inoculum at the site of injection increases the probability PV1 and eTIP1 co-infection, enabling trans-encapsidation of eTIP1s by PV1 structural proteins. Using IFNAR −/− mice increases susceptibility to PV infection and the rapid spread of the virus to diverse tissues. We examined PV1 and eTIP1 replication in muscle, spleen, and spinal cord by RT-qPCR. eTIP1 RNA accumulated at the site of inoculation on days 1 and 3 and decayed by day 6 ( Figure S3 B). eTIP1 RNA was barely or not detected in spleen or spinal cord, indicating that the eTIP1 does not spread beyond the site of inoculation even with PV1 ( Figure S3 B). IFNAR −/− mice inoculated only with eTIP1s showed no sign of distress and survived inoculation for several weeks ( Figure S3 C). Thus, eTIP1 replication is restricted to the site of initial replication (i.e., muscle [IM] or nasal turbinates [IN]).
We next sought to determine the mechanism by which eTIP1 induces the antiviral protective effect. We considered two possible models. In one, DVGs, whose shorter genomes may provide a replication advantage, outcompete the full-length viral genome for cellular resources and encapsidation by structural proteins, thus impairing propagation of parental virus to other cells in the tissue ( Shirogane et al., 2021b 90.

Experimental and mathematical insights on the interactions between poliovirus and a defective interfering genome PLoS Pathog. 2021; 17 :e1009277 Google Scholar ; Vignuzzi and López, 2019 96. Vignuzzi, M. ∙ López, C.B. Defective viral genomes are key drivers of the virus-host interaction Nat. Microbiol. 2019; 4 :1075-1087 Google Scholar ). In the second, DVGs induce an innate response that cross-protects from other viral infections. Self-replicating RNAs, particularly DVGs that form cytosolic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) intermediates, activate pattern recognition receptors, and trigger innate immune responses that lead to production of interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes (ISGs) ( Brennan and Bowie, 2010 6. Brennan, K. ∙ Bowie, A.G. Activation of host pattern recognition receptors by viruses Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2010; 13 :503-507 Google Scholar ; Finlay and McFadden, 2006 31.

In this way, DVGs may induce a systemic antiviral state that interferes with replication of WT virus. In addition, DVGs may cause cells to lose the integrity of their plasma membrane and release damage-associated molecules that recruit various types of circulating leukocytes to the site ( Preissner et al., 2020 75. Preissner, K.T. ∙ Fischer, S. ∙ Deindl, E. Extracellular RNA as a Versatile DAMP and Alarm Signal That Influences Leukocyte Recruitment in Inflammation and Infection Front. Cell Dev. Biol. 2020; 8 :619221 Google Scholar ). While the first option requires co-infection of DVG and WT virus for interference to occur, the second model is consistent with DVGs impairing WT virus replication in a non-cell-autonomous manner. Our data are consistent with the second mechanism.
To test this hypothesis, we performed unbiased transcriptome profiling in lungs of eTIP1- or mock (PBS)-treated mice ( Figure 3 A). Whole lungs were harvested at 1 or 2 days post-IN administration of either 6 × 10 6 IUs of eTIP1s or 30 μg of eTIP1 RNA in LNPs. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis showed that both methods induced a common set of bona fide type I IFN-responsive genes ( Schoggins and Rice, 2011 83. Schoggins, J.W. ∙ Rice, C.M. Interferon-stimulated genes and their antiviral effector functions Curr. Opin. Virol. 2011; 1 :519-525 Google Scholar ; Schoggins et al., 2011 84. Schoggins, J.W. ∙ Wilson, S.J. ∙ Panis, M. ...

Pan-viral specificity of IFN-induced genes reveals new roles for cGAS in innate immunity Nature. 2014; 505 :691-695 Google Scholar ; Xiao et al., 2017 101. Xiao, Y. ∙ Dolan, P.T. ∙ Goldstein, E.F. ... Poliovirus intrahost evolution is required to overcome tissue-specific innate immune responses Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :375 Google Scholar ), including Ifit1-3, Eif2ak2 (PKR), Irf7, Isg15, Rsad2, Mx1, Adar, and a number of Oas paralogs ( Figures 3 C). Type I ISGs were similarly induced regardless of delivery method ( Figures 3 D and S4 B). This was confirmed by RT-qPCR analysis of two ISGs, Mx1 and Ifit, in lungs of mice inoculated with eTIP1s or LNPs ( Figure 2 F). These genes were also induced at 24 h post-infection with PV1, albeit to lower levels ( Figure 2 F). This suggests that the IFN response is stronger without the capsid coding region of PV1. Foot-and-mouth disease virus capsid protein VP3 inhibits IFN signaling ( Li et al., 2016a 57. Li, D. ∙ Wei, J. ∙ Yang, F. ... Foot-and-mouth disease virus structural protein VP3 degrades Janus kinase 1 to inhibit IFN-γ signal transduction pathways Cell Cycle. 2016; 15 :850-860 Google Scholar , 2016b 58. Li, D. ∙ Yang, W. ∙ Yang, F. ... The VP3 structural protein of foot-and-mouth disease virus inhibits the IFN-β signaling pathway FASEB J. 2016; 30 :1757-1766 Google Scholar ). Thus, IN delivery of eTIP1 as biological particles or LNPs stimulates a more robust innate immune response than WT PV.
These experiments suggest that eTIP1 induces an IFN-mediated antiviral state. Next, we directly tested whether eTIP1-mediated antiviral protection requires systemic innate immune stimulation of an IFN response. We tested the capacity of eTIP1 to protect animals lacking the IFN-α/β receptor (IFNAR −/− ) against PV1 infection. Under conditions in which eTIP1 elicits a robust protective activity in immunocompetent WT mice ( Figure 2 ), the antiviral protection is completely lost in animals lacking the IFN-α/β receptor (IFNAR −/− ; Figures 3 E and S4 B). This indicates that IFN-I responses are important for the eTIP1-mediated protection from IP and IN infection with pathogenic PV1.
Next, we determined if eTIP1 protects animals from SARS-CoV-2 infection. At 24 h after a single IN dose of eTIP1 LNPs, we infected K18-hACE2 mice with 6 × 10 4 pfu SARS-CoV-2 (D614G variant). We measured the effects of eTIP1 on SARS-CoV-2 replication in clinically relevant tissues (i.e., lungs and brains) collected on days 3 and 6 post-infection. SARS-CoV-2 replication was detected by plaque assay and RT-qPCR, as well as immunohistochemistry with antibodies against the nucleocapsid proteins (NPs) and spike proteins (SPs). As expected, mice pretreated with control LNPs had significant SARS-CoV-2 titers and widespread NP and SP immunoreactivity throughout the lung and brain ( Figures 4 A–4C). Pretreatment with eTIP1 LNPs lowered SARS-CoV-2 titers and viral RNA copies by 2–3 logs ( Figure 4 A) and reduced immunoreactivity in lungs and brains ( Figures 4 B and 4C). Inoculation of LNPs carrying eTIP1 inactivated by UV, a replication-incompetent eTIP1 RNA carrying a large deletion of the 3′ of the genome (truncated PvuII), or poly IC did not protect mice from SARS-CoV-2 infection ( Figure S5 A), indicating that eTIP1s must be replication competent to protect from SARS-CoV-2 infection, as shown earlier ( Figure 2 A).
We also tested if eTIP1s protect against other variants of concern or interest (VOCs or VOIs), including B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.617.2 (Delta), and B1.427/B1.429 (Epsilon). Inoculation of eTIP1 24 h before infection reduced virus titers in lungs by two orders of magnitude ( Figure 4 A, ii , eTIP1-prophylactic). Treatment with eTIP1s 24 h post-exposure to SARS-CoV-2 also elicited protection ( Figure 4 A, ii, eTIP1-therapeutic). The protective effects of eTIP1s were lost when administered 48 h after infection, but repeating eTIP1 treatment at both 24 and 48 h post-infection increased its efficiency ( Figure 5 A). These results indicate that pre- and post-exposure eTIP1 prophylaxis protects from IN infection with several circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants.
Weight loss is a sensitive measure of animal distress. SARS-CoV-2 infected mice lost weight due to disease progression. Strikingly, a single IN eTIP1 dose prevented weight loss in SARS-CoV-2-infected mice. In fact, eTIP1-treated animals maintained their body weight, similar to mock-infected controls ( Figure 5 B). This confirmed that eTIP1s reduce SARS-CoV-2 replication and prevent disease symptoms without additional distress. Next, we wondered if eTIP1s protect lungs from SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced inflammation. Lung sections were analyzed after staining with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and scored on tissue pathology ( Meyerholz and Beck, 2020 63. Meyerholz, D.K. ∙ Beck, A.P. Histopathologic Evaluation and Scoring of Viral Lung Infection Methods Mol. Biol. 2020; 2099 :205-220 Google Scholar ). SARS-CoV-2-infected mice had higher histopathology scores than mock-infected mice ( Figure 5 C, i and ii ). The major histopathology findings in infected mice were proteinaceous debris in the alveolar space, neutrophils in the interstitial space, and alveolar septal thickening. These are consistent with previous studies that detected signs of lung injury, including interstitial pneumonia, inflammatory cell infiltrates, and alveolar septal thickening ( Dinnon et al., 2020 25. Dinnon, 3rd, K.H. ∙ Leist, S.R. ∙ Schäfer, A. ... A mouse-adapted model of SARS-CoV-2 to test COVID-19 countermeasures Nature. 2020; 586 :560-566 Google Scholar ; Gu et al., 2020 40. Gu, H. ∙ Chen, Q. ∙ Yang, G. ... Adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 in BALB/c mice for testing vaccine efficacy Science. 2020; 369 :1603-1607 Google Scholar ). By histopathology analysis, treatment with eTIP1 LNPs reduced lung inflammation after exposure to SARS-CoV-2 (histopathology score of 1/16 compared to empty-LNP histopathology score of 5.4/16) at day 3 post-infection ( Figure 5 C, i and ii , SARS-CoV-2/eTIP1). No peribronchial inflammation was noted in the lungs when animals were treated with eTIP1s alone, indicating that eTIP1 replication does not cause persistent inflammation ( Figure 5 C, i and ii , eTIP1). Thus, a single IN dose of eTIP1s reduces in vivo replication of SARS-CoV-2 by orders of magnitude and prevents lung inflammation and SARS-CoV-2 infection-related weight loss ( Jiang et al., 2020 48. Jiang, R.-D. ∙ Liu, M.-Q. ∙ Chen, Y. ...

Sun, S.-H. ∙ Chen, Q. ∙ Gu, H.-J. ... A Mouse Model of SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Pathogenesis Cell Host Microbe. 2020; 28 :124-133.e4 Google Scholar ).
Although SARS-CoV-2 replication is strongly inhibited, H&E staining showed infiltration of lymphoid cells into the lung ( Figure 5 C), which may be linked to an eTIP1-mediated antiviral state. To determine which cells are recruited to the lung upon eTIP1 treatment, we performed immune cell profiling in lung tissues at 24 h after IN inoculation with eTIP1 LNPs ( Figure S5 ). We also examined immune cell profiles 3 days post-SARS-CoV-2 infection with or without eTIP1 pre-exposure prophylaxis. No differences were observed in lung immune cell populations 24 h after inoculation with eTIP1 ( Figure 5 D, compare mock with eTIP1/LNPs). In the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection, eTIP1 treatment recruited different lymphoid cells into the lung, including eosinophils, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, and neutrophils, which are poorly recruited by SARS-CoV-2 infection alone ( Figure 5 D). Eosinophils can be recruited to the airways in response to influenza and mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) infection in a type I IFN-dependent fashion ( Bohrer et al., 2021 5. Bohrer, A.C. ∙ Castro, E. ∙ Hu, Z. ..., Tuberculosis Imaging Program Eosinophils are part of the granulocyte response in tuberculosis and promote host resistance in mice J. Exp. Med. 2021; 218 :e20210469 Google Scholar ; Samarasinghe et al., 2014 81. Samarasinghe, A.E. ∙ Woolard, S.N. ∙ Boyd, K.L. ... The immune profile associated with acute allergic asthma accelerates clearance of influenza virus Immunol. Cell Biol. 2014; 92 :449-459 Google Scholar ). eTIP1s reduced the recruitment of CD11b+/ CD11c+/Ly6C+ monocyte to the lungs of SARS-CoV-2-infected animals ( Figure 5 D), which may be associated with the pro-inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. No other changes in immune cell populations were seen after eTIP1 pre-exposure prophylaxis ( Figures 5 D and S6 ). These data indicate that eTIP1 treatment modulates the recruitment of immune cells into the lung during SARS-CoV-2 infection.
A critical question is whether eTIP1-mediated protection from SARS-CoV-2 prevents the development of adaptive immunity against future reinfections. Immunity could last at least 5–6 months after infection ( Huang et al., 2021 45. Huang, Q. ∙ Ji, K. ∙ Tian, S. ... A single-dose mRNA vaccine provides a long-term protection for hACE2 transgenic mice from SARS-CoV-2 Nat. Commun. 2021; 12 :776 Google Scholar ). Thus, reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 may occur in fewer than 1% of individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, at least within 3–6 months after infection. However, the natural protection is variable and unreliable, especially among older people ( Collier et al., 2021 17. Collier, D.A. ∙ Ferreira, I.A.T.M. ∙ Kotagiri, P. ..., CITIID-NIHR BioResource COVID-19 Collaboration Age-related immune response heterogeneity to SARS-CoV-2 vaccine BNT162b2 Nature. 2021; 596 :417-422 Google Scholar ).
To test if adaptive immunity against SARS-CoV-2 is induced in animals protected by eTIP1s, mice were treated with eTIP1s or control empty LNPs, and 24 h post-treatment, mice were infected with 10 5 , 10 4 , or 10 3 pfu of SARS-CoV-2 (B.1.1.7 variant). Inoculation of eTIP1s reduced virus titers in lungs by three orders of magnitude more than controls ( Figure 6 B, for 10 5 pfu). By RT-qPCR, we found that eTIP1 treatment effectively reduced SARS-CoV-2 RNA load in lungs 24-fold compared to SARS-CoV-2 infection without eTIP1 treatment. However, we detected low levels of viral RNA in lungs ( Figure 6 B). At 3 weeks after infection, we measured neutralizing antibody titers. Antibody titers and seroconversion rate correlated with the initial SARS-CoV-2 concentration used to infect the mice ( Figure 6 C). Thus, mice infected with 10 5 pfu had a more effective induction of neutralizing antibodies than those infected with 10 4 or 10 3 pfu. Strikingly, antibody titers were similar in eTIP1-treated and untreated animals ( Figure 6 C). We next challenged animals intranasally with 10 5 pfu of SARS-CoV-2 (B.1.1.7) and measured virus loads in lung tissues 3 days post-reinfection ( Figure 6 D). Mice initially infected with 10 5 pfu of SARS-CoV-2 and treated with eTIP1 were well protected, but low doses of SARS-CoV-2 in the initial infection did not reliably generate protective immunity. Mice infected with high doses of SARS-CoV-2 were more susceptible to reinfection. Perhaps higher doses of SARS-CoV-2 suppress effective induction of adaptive immunity, enabling re-infection. Additional investigations will be necessary to fully understand this observation.
Nevertheless, our findings indicate that eTIP1s replicate in the initial infected cells at the site of administration, without spreading to other cells ( Figure 3 B). Given that only replication-competent eTIP1s elicit protective responses ( Figures 2 A and S5 ), we hypothesize that intermediates of replication, such as dsRNA, are detected by pattern recognition receptors, leading to synthesis of type I IFN and induction of potent innate responses. Because the PV1 protease and other non-structural viral proteins in the eTIP1 induce profound rearrangements of cellular organelles and pathways, which may generate additional signals that further activate innate responses ( Figure 6 E). This results in the recruitment of leukocytes into the tissue and promotes an antiviral response that protects local and distal sites (non-cell-autonomous effects) ( Figure 6 E). Thus, molecular processes triggered by eTIP1 mimic a “natural infection” that recruits the different arms of immunity in a balanced manner, generating a protective antiviral response.
Mucosal challenges with RNA viruses achieve sterilizing immunity with no adverse effects involving short- or long-term immune dysfunction ( Ascough et al., 2019 2. Ascough, S. ∙ Vlachantoni, I. ∙ Kalyan, M. ... Local and Systemic Immunity against Respiratory Syncytial Virus Induced by a Novel Intranasal Vaccine.

Our data suggest that modulation of natural innate antiviral immunity is a primary component of eTIP1 antiviral activity. Importantly, a single intranasal dose prevents progression to severe viral disease longer than a single dose of small-molecule antivirals ( Chen et al., 2021 13. Chen, R.E. ∙ Winkler, E.S. ∙ Case, J.B. ... In vivo monoclonal antibody efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 variant strains Nature. 2021; 596 :103-108 Google Scholar ; Gu et al., 2020 40.

Wang, C. ∙ Li, W. ∙ Drabek, D. ... A human monoclonal antibody blocking SARS-CoV-2 infection Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :2251 Google Scholar ). We conclude that IN delivery of eTIP1 nanoparticles safely and potently stimulates host innate immunity that broadly protect from infection by reducing viral loads and preventing disease. While the antiviral response elicited by eTIP1 confers short-term protection as pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis, it does not interfere with long-term adaptive immunity ( Figure 6 C) that protects from reinfection ( Figure 6 D). We propose that eTIP1 has a compelling clinical potential in the treatment of respiratory viral disease.

Section: Discussion

Here, we provide proof of principle that DVGs can be used as pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis against diverse viral pathogens. We show that eTIP1s can be administered IN to combat respiratory infections from enterovirus to SARS-CoV-2, without side effects. Because eTIP1 IN inoculation offers protection from 48 h before to 24 h after exposure, it provides an effective therapeutic window, comparable to small-molecule antivirals. Inoculation of eTIP1 provides rapid protection against ongoing infection, but also promotes long-term protection by generating longer-lasting adaptive immunity.
Our study provides a mechanistic rationale for decades-old observations that immunization with live attenuated PV cross-protects against other viruses and DVGs modulate the course of infection ( Easton et al., 2011 28.

Microbiol. 2019; 4 :1075-1087 Google Scholar ). Our results are consistent with research indicating that DVG protection depends on induction of innate responses ( Vignuzzi and López, 2019 96. Vignuzzi, M. ∙ López, C.B. Defective viral genomes are key drivers of the virus-host interaction Nat. Microbiol. 2019; 4 :1075-1087 Google Scholar ). For example, influenza lacking the NS1 protein was studied as a potential vaccine and antiviral approach ( García-Sastre et al., 1998 34. García-Sastre, A. ∙ Egorov, A. ∙ Matassov, D. ...

Zhang, L. ∙ Wang, J. ∙ Muñoz-Moreno, R. ... Influenza Virus NS1 Protein RNA-Interactome Reveals Intron Targeting J. Virol. 2018; 92 e01634-18 Google Scholar ). eTIP1 treatment does not protect animals defective in type I IFN signaling ( Figures 3 E and S2 ) and offers effective protection against viruses from different families in a non-cell-autonomous manner ( Figures 2 , 3 B, 5 , and 6 ), in agreement with this mechanism.
In the last 2 years, the challenges of antiviral drug development have become clearer than ever. The mutational plasticity of RNA viruses can render most drug and even antibody therapies ineffective. Vaccinations, the only available tool to prevent viral infection, harness the natural defenses of the body. No similar approach is available for prophylaxis or treatment. We propose that eTIP1s provide an alternative strategy with potential benefits over conventional pharmaceuticals. While viruses can become resistant to currently available antivirals ( Deng et al., 2021 22. Deng, X. ∙ Garcia-Knight, M.A. ∙ Khalid, M.M. ...

SARS-CoV-2 spike D614G change enhances replication and transmission Nature. 2021; 592 :122-127 Google Scholar ), eTIP1s induce a multicomponent antiviral response, in the form of diverse ISGs, that is unlikely to result in resistance by viral mutation. Modulation of the innate response by eTIP1 replication may enhance development of adaptive immunity, thus providing long-term protection.
Our eTIP1 design has several safety features. First, the PV backbone is non-pathogenic and can be administered non-invasively. Modification of the eTIP1 genome, based on improvements in the live-attenuated PV vaccine ( Van Damme et al., 2019 95. Van Damme, P. ∙ De Coster, I. ∙ Bandyopadhyay, A.S. ...

Engineering the Live-Attenuated Polio Vaccine to Prevent Reversion to Virulence Cell Host Microbe. 2020; 27 :736-751.e8 Google Scholar ), may enhance their safety. Second, eTIP1 replication is limited to a few cells near the site of inoculation and is undetectable by 24 h (not shown). It elicits a non-cell-autonomous protective immune response without disease symptoms by recruiting immune cells that circulate throughout the respiratory tract ( Figures 5 D and S6 ). Third, because eTIP1 replicates and self-amplifies in the few cells it enters, it requires less RNA to induce full non-cell-autonomous antiviral protection. eTIP1s seem to induce a more potent responses than PV1 ( Figure 3 F), suggesting that the capsid proteins modulate IFN responses. Finally, the nanoparticle formulation of the eTIP1 circumvents concerns that pre-existing immunity will prevent repeated administration.
eTIP1 protective action also induces a balanced and non-detrimental antiviral state. Such a state is not seen with WT viruses, likely because all viruses evolved mechanisms to suppress antiviral responses. In addition, there was no weight loss or signs of distress in the animals treated with eTIP1s, and even those co-infected with SARS-CoV-2 showed no signs of disease. Animals infected with SARS-CoV-2 can be protected by IN administration of IFN-I ( Bessière et al., 2021 4. Bessière, P. ∙ Wasniewski, M. ∙ Picard-Meyer, E. ...

However, antiviral treatments relying on administration of IFNs or dsRNA mimics (e.g., poly(I:C) or 5′triphosphate dsRNA; Caskey et al., 2011 10. Caskey, M. ∙ Lefebvre, F. ∙ Filali-Mouhim, A. ...

Dysregulated Type I Interferon and Inflammatory Monocyte-Macrophage Responses Cause Lethal Pneumonia in SARS-CoV-Infected Mice Cell Host Microbe. 2016; 19 :181-193 Google Scholar ). We propose that eTIP1s achieve balanced regulation of innate responses and avoid the detrimental effects of IFN treatment.
One IN dose of eTIP1s provide a powerful prophylactic and therapeutic weapon in the COVID-19 pandemic and future respiratory diseases, including influenza and common cold, and other enterovirus diseases. In SARS-CoV-2 infection in mice, eTIP1s appear to thwart a proinflammatory response by SARS-CoV-2, thereby preventing damage to the lung and brain ( Figure 5 ). The genes induced by eTIP1 are not proinflammatory but antiviral ( Figures 3 ). Thus, eTIP1s block SARS-CoV-2 replication, an important first step in controlling disease, and redirect the host response from inflammatory to antiviral, which should increase the protection from disease. We also found that eTIP1s protect animals already infected with SARS-CoV-2 from disease and recruit immune cells, including eosinophils, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, and neutrophils ( Figure 5 ). eTIP1 treatment reduced recruitment of myeloid subset CD11b+/ CD11c+/Ly6C+ monocyte into the lung in infection ( Figure 5 D), possibly limiting production of proinflammatory cytokines. Thus, eTIP1s mediate antiviral immunity and prevent inflammation. Surprisingly, when eTIP1s are administered 24 h post-infection with SARS-CoV-2, they protect mice from infection and increase high-titer protective neutralizing antibodies ( Figures 6 C and 6D). We speculate that the IFN-dependent antiviral state produced by eTIP1s enhances the presentation of even small amounts of SARS-CoV-2 antigens to the adaptive immune system. eTIP1s act as an antiviral and a vaccine adjuvant, leading to short- and long-term protection.
SARS-CoV-2 infections result in heterogeneous outcomes, ranging from no symptoms to severe disease and death. The reasons are unclear. The main hypothesis is that a dysregulated immune response, probably early on, leads to systemic hyperinflammation (cytokine storm) that may drive acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ damage in severe disease ( Darif et al., 2021 20.

Que, Y. ∙ Hu, C. ∙ Wan, K. ... Cytokine release syndrome in COVID-19: a major mechanism of morbidity and mortality Int. Rev. Immunol. 2021; Google Scholar ; Zhou et al., 2020 106.

Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study Lancet. 2020; 395 :1054-1062 Google Scholar ). Important questions are whether SARS-CoV-2 infection induces long-lasting protective immunity and if an initial infection protects from recurrent disease. In macaques, SARS-CoV-2 infection results in protective immunity when the animals are challenged soon after resolution of the primary infection ( Bao et al., 2020 3. Bao, L. ∙ Deng, W. ∙ Huang, B. ... The pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 in hACE2 transgenic mice Nature. 2020; 583 :830-833 Google Scholar ; Chandrashekar et al., 2020 11.

Deng, W. ∙ Bao, L. ∙ Liu, J. ... Primary exposure to SARS-CoV-2 protects against reinfection in rhesus macaques Science. 2020; 369 :818-823 Google Scholar ). However, reinfection in humans has been reported a few months after initial infection, challenging the idea of long-lasting protective immunity ( Cohen et al., 2021 16. Cohen, C. ∙ Kleynhans, J. ∙ Gottberg, A. ... SARS-CoV-2 incidence, transmission and reinfection in a rural and an urban setting: results of the PHIRST-C cohort study, South Africa, 2020-2021 Medrxiv. 2021; Google Scholar ; Gupta et al., 2020 42. Gupta, V. ∙ Bhoyar, R.C. ∙ Jain, A. ... Asymptomatic Reinfection in 2 Healthcare Workers From India With Genetically Distinct Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Clin. Infect. Dis. 2020; 73 :e2823-e2825 Google Scholar ; Murillo-Zamora et al., 2021 64. Murillo-Zamora, E. ∙ Mendoza-Cano, O. ∙ Delgado-Enciso, I. ... Predictors of severe symptomatic laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 reinfection Public Health. 2021; 193 :113-115 Google Scholar ). Thus, dysregulation of the immune response by SARS-CoV-2 may impair long-lasting immunity after infection. Our data suggest that eTIP1 co-infection circumvents this limitation. eTIP1s modulate the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection by activating IFN-I responses ( Figures 3 and 5 D); this seems to counteract the suppressive effects of SARS-CoV-2, allowing production of neutralizing antibodies even if viral antigens are scarce.
We observed that differences in virus replication between eTIP1-treated and untreated animals do not change the ability of infected animals to generate protective neutralizing antibodies ( Figures 6 C and 6D). This suggests that the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection produces sufficient antigenic proteins to elicit protective adaptive immunity, even without SARS-CoV-2 replication and spread and that eTIP1s act as an efficient therapy against SARS-CoV-2 infection and as an adjuvant, effectively turning the infecting virus into a vaccine. We conclude that eTIP1 prevents severe disease in the short term and facilitates long-lasting adaptive immunity. This strategy may provide a solution to emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.
Our data indicate that eTIP1s are an effective antiviral approach to harness natural immunity to fight infection in a balanced, safe, and controlled manner, utilizing the regulatory circuits that evolved to ensure protection from disease without causing self-afflicted damage ( Rahim et al., 2020 77. Rahim, M.M.A. ∙ Parsons, B.D. ∙ Price, E.L. ... Defective Influenza A Virus RNA Products Mediate MAVS-Dependent Upregulation of Human Leukocyte Antigen Class I Proteins J. Virol. 2020; 94 e00165-20 Google Scholar ; Vignuzzi and López, 2019 96. Vignuzzi, M. ∙ López, C.B. Defective viral genomes are key drivers of the virus-host interaction Nat. Microbiol. 2019; 4 :1075-1087 Google Scholar ). DVG-based antiviral therapy may offer greater benefits and safety than conventional therapies, given its broad-spectrum capacity that may prevent rapid emergence of resistant variants and its short and long-lasting protective activity. These properties may contribute to fighting COVID-19 and other emerging or re-emerging viral threats.
Effective protection by eTIP1s is limited to 24–48 h before and after infection. This may reduce the usefulness of the approach to infections with a short incubation time before onset of symptoms. Our study is a proof of principle in small-animal models of infection, and more studies will be needed to understand its full therapeutic potential, given that COVID-19 characteristics are not fully replicated in mice. While we provide evidence that co-infection with a helper virus does not mobilize eTIP1 to other tissues, a more extensive trial is needed to establish the safety of this approach in the context of co-circulating enteroviruses. A particularly important question is if eTIP1 treatment can enhance disease through the induction of a “cytokine storm” ( Fajgenbaum and June, 2020 29. Fajgenbaum, D.C. ∙ June, C.H. Cytokine Storm N. Engl. J. Med. 2020; 383 :2255-2273 Google Scholar ; Findlay et al., 2015 30. Findlay, J.S. ∙ Ulaeto, D. ∙ D’Elia, R.V. Cytokines and viral hemorrhagic fever: potential for therapeutic intervention Future Virology. 2015; 5 :547-557 Google Scholar ; Yuan et al., 2021 104. Yuan, S. ∙ Jiang, S.-C. ∙ Zhang, Z.-W. ... Quantification of Cytokine Storms During Virus Infections Front. Immunol. 2021; 12 :659419 Google Scholar ). The mechanisms and dynamics of the induction of protective responses are limited by the number of time points and type of samples analyzed. To optimize the efficacy and safety of this strategy, additional data with higher degrees of temporal and anatomic resolution are needed.

Immunol. 2020; 21 :1327-1335 Google Scholar ) (The Jackson laboratory, https://www.jax.org/strain/034860 , stock number: 034860, B6. Cg-Tg(K18-ACE2)2Prlmn/J, Hemizygous).
C57BL6TgPVR and IFNAR −/− mice were kindly provided by Professor Julie Pfeiffer of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, and originally were generated by Dr. Satoshi Koike of Tokyo Metropolitan Institute for Neuroscience (“TOKYO”) ( Ida-Hosonuma et al., 2005 46. Ida-Hosonuma, M. ∙ Iwasaki, T. ∙ Yoshikawa, T. ... The alpha/beta interferon response controls tissue tropism and pathogenicity of poliovirus J. Virol. 2005; 79 :4460-4469 Google Scholar ). We followed protocols approved by the UCSF Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) for the mouse studies.
To generate viruses and eTIP1 particle, T7 polymerase was used to generate in vitro transcribed (IVT) viral RNA derived from corresponding linearized prib (+) XpA Mahoney or eTIP1 plasmid by Apa1. The resulting 10 μg IVT RNA of PV1 were electroporated into 8x10 6 HeLaS3 cells. And IVT RNAs of eTIP1 were electroporated into 8x10 6 packing cells line. The detail methods as below. Monolayer of HeLaS3 or Packaging cells was trypsinized and washed three times in D-PBS. Cells were resuspended in D-PBS and the number of cells were counted on a hemo-cytometer, adjusting the concentration to 10 7 cells per ml. 800 μL of cells and 10 μg IVT RNAs were transfer into a chilled 4-mm electroporation cuvette and incubated 20 min on ice. Cells were electroporated with IVT RNAs (voltage = 200 V, capacitance = 1000 μF) using Gene Pulser I (Bio-Rad) and recovered in 8 mL pre-warmed medium ( Burrill et al., 2013a 7. Burrill, C.P. ∙ Strings, V.R. ∙ Andino, R. Poliovirus: Generation, Quantification, Propagation, Purification, and Storage Curr. Protoc. Microbiol. 2013; Google Scholar , 2013b 8. Burrill, C.P. ∙ Strings, V.R. ∙ Schulte, M.B. ... Poliovirus: Generation and Characterization of Mutants Curr. Protoc. Microbiol. 2013; Google Scholar ). Viruses and eTIP1 were harvested at around 24 h (or total CPE) to generate P0 virus or eTIP1 stocks. P0 virus stock were amplified once in cultured HeLaS3 in 2% serum media at M.O.I ∼0.2 to generate a passage 1 (P1) stocks. P0 eTIP1 stocks were amplified once in cultured packaging cell line in 2% serum media at M.O.I ∼0.2 to generate a passage 1 (P1) stocks.
Monolayers of HeLaS3 cells in 6-well plates were infected with 250 μL of serially diluted virus samples then incubated at 37°C for about 30 min, then 1% agarose overlay were added on the top. For titer eTIP, HeLaS3 cells were grown in 48-wells plate. On the following day, 100ul, 10-folds serially diluted eTIP1 samples were added to each well. Then incubation for 1 h, 400ul regular medium was added into each well. At 8-9 h post-infection, GFP-positive cells were counted as the eTIP1 titers and represent IU/mL. To measure the EV-D68 infected samples, TCID50 were performed on RD cells. RD cells were seed to 96 wells plate in 2%FBS DMEM/H21 medium with 10 4 cells per well one day before performing the TCID50.
Primers and Taqman probes for droplet digital PCR assay were designed with PrimerQuest Tool (Integrated DNA Technologies). The primers and probe for PV1 genomes are 5′- CCACATACAGACGATCCCATAC-3′, 5′-CTGCCCAGTGTGTGTAGTAAT-3′, and 5′- 6-FAM-TCTGCCTGTCACTCTCTCCAGCTT-3′-BHQ1. The primers and probe for eTIP1 genomes are 5′-GACAGCGAAGCCAATCCA-3′, 5′ CCATGTGTAGTCGTCCCATTT-3′, and 5′-HEX-ACGAAAGAG/ZEN/TCGGTACCACCAGGC-3′-IABkFQ.
Droplet digital PCR assay. 2 μL of serially diluted cDNA samples was mixed with 10 μL of 2x ddPCR super-mix for probes (Bio-Rad), 1 μL of 20x PV1 or eTIP1 primers/probe, 1 μL of 20x eTIP1 primers/probe, and 6 μL of nuclease-free water. 20 μL reaction mix of each sample was dispensed into the droplet generator cartridge, followed by droplet production with QX100 droplet generator (Bio-Rad). Then PCR was performed on a thermal cycler using the following parameters: 1 cycle of 10 min at 95°C. 60°C of 1 min for 40x cycles. Then the PCR product were read and calculated by QX100 droplet reader.
2.5 × 10 5 HelaS3 cells were seeded in 24-well plates. On the following day, cells were washed twice with PBS and were infected with virus in 200 μl, 2% serum media at M.O.I = 0.1 with virus alone or co-infected with mixed virus +eTIP1 (at ratio: 1:10, 1:20, 1:50, 1:100) or with eTIP1 alone at MOI is 5 (three replicate wells were used for each virus at each time point). Following an h incubation at 37°C, each well was washed twice with PBS, and cells were covered with fresh complete media. At each indicated time point, the corresponding plate was frozen at −80°C. Following three freeze-thaw cycles of the plates, standard plaque assays were performed on monolayer HeLaS3 cells grown in a 6-wells plate (∼10 6 HeLaS3 cells per well). Or TCID50 for EV-D68 on RD cells.
Packaging cell lines (HelaS3/P1) generating eTIP1 (500 ml) was harvested with 0.5% NP-40, and the sample was stored at −80°C. For virus purification, the sample was subjected to three freeze-thaw cycles. For virus precipitation, PEG 8000 was added to a final concentration of 10% and stored overnight at 4°C. The precipitated sample was pelleted by spinning at 3,500 g for 1 h. The pellet was suspended in 10 mL EB-buffer (50mM Tris pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5% NP-40) and centrifuged at 3,500 g for 30 min at 4°C to remove cell debris and insoluble materials. The soluble fraction containing eTIP1 in the supernatant was overlayed on a 2 mL 30% sucrose cushion in EB-buffer at 105,000 g for 3 h at 4°C. The pellet was suspended in EB-buffer and centrifuged at 12,000 g for 30 min at 4°C to remove insoluble material. The soluble fraction containing eTIP1 was then laid on the top of a 15%–45% sucrose gradient in EB-buffer and centrifuged at 105,000 g for 3 h at 4°C. Fractions of 1 mL size from top of the gradient was collected containing eTIP1. Two fractions from top were pooled together, and sucrose in the sample was removed using a spin desalting column (Zebra; Pierce) and buffer exchanged with PBS. eTIP1 in PBS were then concentrated using Amicon ultra device with 100 kDa MWCO. Purity and integrity of the eTIP1 were tested by SDS-PAGE, silver staining. Negative stain and electro-microscopy were used on the particle. Franction#5-6 is combined, titered and used to inoculate into mice.
We followed protocols approved by the UCSF Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) for the mouse studies. In these experiments, 5 to 6-weeks-old C57BL6TgPVR or 6 to 8-weeks-old C57BL6 TgPVR interferon α/β receptor knockout (IFNAR −/− ) both male and female mice were used and infected under anesthesia. C57BL6TgPVR and IFNAR −/− were kindly provided by Professor Julie Pfeiffer of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, and originally were generated by Dr. Satoshi Koike of Tokyo Metropolitan Institute for Neuroscience (“TOKYO”) ( Ida-Hosonuma et al., 2005 46. Ida-Hosonuma, M. ∙ Iwasaki, T. ∙ Yoshikawa, T. ... The alpha/beta interferon response controls tissue tropism and pathogenicity of poliovirus J. Virol. 2005; 79 :4460-4469 Google Scholar ).
For mice survival studies, mice were injected by intraperitoneal injection (IP, 100 μL per mouse), by intranasal injection (IN, 20-50ul per mouse) with serial dilutions of each virus, respectively (10 mice per group) ( Nagata et al., 2004 66. Nagata, N. ∙ Iwasaki, T. ∙ Ami, Y. ... A poliomyelitis model through mucosal infection in transgenic mice bearing human poliovirus receptor, TgPVR21 Virology. 2004; 321 :87-100 Google Scholar ). If UV- treatment was involved, then the eTIP1 were UV-treatment for 2 h. For the influenza H1N1(PR8 strain) experiment, the mouse will weight daily. Mice were monitored twice daily for the onset of paralysis and were euthanized when death was imminent.
For protection study on poliovirus, we injected C57BL6 TgPVR mice with viral supernatant 10 7 pfu of PV1 alone or with eTIP1 ratio at 1:1, 1:10 per mouse by IP route or 1:20 by I.N. route (PV1 is 3x10 5 pfu per mouse), For tissue distribution studies, we injected C57BL6 TgPVR mice (3 to 5 mice per group) with 3x10 5 pfu of PV1 virus per mouse by intranasal(IN) route, Half of the organs were collected from infected mice and homogenized in 1 mL serum-free media. Viral supernatants were collected from the tissue homogenates, following three freeze-thaw cycles, and centrifuged at 5,000 g for 10 min in a bench top centrifuge at 4°C. Regular plaque assays were performed on HeLaS3 cells to titer viral supernatants from tissues. For protection study on CVB3 virus, we injected Tg21 mice with viral supernatant 10 5 pfu of PV1 alone or with eTIP1 ratio at 1:100, 1:10 per mouse by IP route 24 h or 48 h post-infection, animals were weighted and checked daily.
For the pre-treat experiments, we inoculated C57BL6 TgPVR mice with 6x10 6 IU eTIP1 particles in PBS by intranasally. 24 h and 48 h inoculation, 3x10 5 pfu PV1 or 10 5 pfu influenza(A/PR8) virus was inoculated into Tg21 mice. For the therapeutics experiments on poliovirus, we inoculated C57BL6 TgPVR mice, 3x10 5 pfu PV1 by intranasally at day 0, then inoculated with 6x10 6 IU eTIP1 in PBS by intranasally daily from day1 to day5. For the therapeutics experiments on flu, 10 5 pfu influenza(A/PR8) by intranasally at day 0, then inoculated with 30ug eTIP1 RNA at 24- or 48 h post-infection.
For tissue distribution studies, The IFNAR −/− mice were inoculated by I.M. route with 200 pfu PV1 alone or with eTIP (PV1: eTIP1 at ratio = 1:5000) per mouse (3 mice per group). Mice were euthanized with CO2, muscle, spleen, spinal cord were collected and at 1, 3, 6 days post infection. The tissues were homogenized in 1 mL Trizol reagents (Ambion). Total RNAs were extracted and treated with Dnase1(NEB). RT-qPCR were formed as droplet qPCR section.
SARS-CoV-2 cell culture and animals works were performed in the Biosafety level 3(BSL-3), under the guidance and protocols approved by UCSF Biosafety and Animal research committees.
African green monkey kidney Vero-E6 cell line (ATCC#1586) and Calu-3 cells (ATCC® HTB-55) was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC#1586) and maintained in Minimum Essential Medium (MEM, GIBCO Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, GIBCO Invitrogen), 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin-Glutamine (GIBCO Invitrogen) at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. A clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020, BEI Cat No: NR-52281 with D614G) or 2 or variants of concerns (V.O.C), was propagated in Vero E6 cells and A549-ACE2 cells. Viral titer was quantified with plaque assay. All the infections in the context of SARS-CoV-2 were performed at biosafety level-3 (BSL-3).
For prophylactic and coinfection experiments, ∼70% monolayers of Calu-3 cells (1 × 10 5 cells/well in 24-well plates) were pretreated with eTIP1 particles with MOI = 5 for 5 h (pretreatment), then infected with SARS-CoV-2 (MOI = 0.1) for 1 h at 37 °C, the virus mixture was removed, cells were further cultured with medium. At indication time-point 16, 24, 36, 48 hpi (h post infection), supernatants were collected, and viral titers of supernatant were detected with plaque assay.

For viral loads experiments on B.1.1.7 ( Figure 6 ), C57B/6j Mice were sacrificed, and lungs were collected at 3 days post-infection, weighted and homogenized with 1ml 2% FBS MEM medium with gentleMACS - C tubes (Miltenyi Biotec Catlog# 130-093-237), plaque assays were performed on Vero-TMPRSS2 cells for titration of the virus.
Sera were two folds series diluted start at 20-folds dilution in 2% FBS MEM, then incubate with equal volume with SARS-CoV-2 virus (2000PFU per ml) at 37C for 2 hours, then plaque assay were performed on Vero-TMPRSS2 cells.
For pathology and immuno-fluorescence, mice tissues were collected and fixed in the 4% PFA, then the tissues were embedding with paraffin and wax, then processed and the tissue samples will cut at 5 μM, and H&E staining were performed at the Gladstone Histology and light core.
Deparaffinization, rehydration, and HIER were performed on an a ST4020 small linear stainer (Leica). For deparaffinization, slides were baked at 70 °C for 1–1.5 h, followed by rehydration in descending concentrations of ethanol (100% twice, 95% twice, 80%, 70%, ddH2O twice; each step for 30 s). Washes were performed using a Leica ST4020 Linear Stainer (Leica Biosystems, Wetzlar, Germany) programmed to three dips per wash for 30 s each. H& E staining were performed. For I.F., HIER was performed in a Lab VisionTM PT module (Thermo Fisher) using Dako Target Retrieval Solution, pH 9 (S236784-2, DAKO Agilent) at 97 °C for 10 min and cooled down to 65 °C. After further cooling to room temperature for 30 min, slides were washed for 10 min three times in Tris-Buffered Saline (TBS), containing 0.1% Tween 20 (Cell Marque; TBST). Sections were then blocked in 5% normal donkey serum in TBST at room temperature for 1 h, followed by incubation with primary antibodies in the blocking solution. After one overnight incubation of primary antibodies in 4 °C, sections were washed three times with TBST and stained with the appropriate secondary antibodies in PBS with 3% bovine serum albumin, 0.4% saponin, and 0.02% sodium azide at room temperature for 1 h. Following this, sections were washed three times with TBST and mounted with ProLong Gold Antifade mounting medium with DAPI (Invitrogen). The primary antibodies and final titrations used were mouse anti-acetylated α Tubulin (ACTUB) (1:300; Santa Cruz sc-23950), rabbit anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid(N) (1:1000; GeneTex GTX135361), and mouse anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike(S) (1:600; GeneTex GTX632604). Secondary antibodies include highly cross-adsorbed donkey anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 647 1:500 (Thermo A32795) and highly cross-adsorbed donkey anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 555 1:500 (Thermo A32773). The Immunofluorescence (IF) for poliovirus eTIP1 inoculated mice head and lung sections, antibody against-poliovirus antibody 3B(Vpg) (1:200).
Fluorescence-immunolabeled images were acquired using a Zeiss AxioImager Z1 microscope or Keyence BZ-X710 fluorescent microscope. Post-imaging processing was performed using FIJI / ImageJ. The intensity of nucleocapsid(N) and spike (SP) were qualified by mean intensity of the at least ten areas at same places in each tissue section. Figures were organized using Adobe Illustrator.
Paraffin-embedded lung tissue blocks for mouse lungs were cut into 5 μm sections. Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and analyzed. Digital light microscopic scans of whole lung processed in toto were examined by an experienced veterinary pathologist. Hematoxylin Eosin(H&E) stained sections of lung from K18 hACE2 mice were examined by implementing a semiquantitative, 5-point grading scheme (0 - within normal limits, 1 - mild, 2 - moderate, 3 - marked, 4 - severe). that considers four different histopathological parameters: 1) perivascular inflammation 2) bronchial or bronchiolar epithelial degeneration or necrosis 3) bronchial or bronchiolar inflammation and 4) alveolar inflammation. These changes were absent (grade 0) in lungs from vehicle and eTIP1 treated uninfected mice from groups that were utilized for this assessment ( Meyerholz and Beck, 2020 63.

For the prophylactic experiments for poliovirus challenging, we inoculated 6 weeks old Tg21 PVR mice with or without 30ug eTIP1 RNA with lipofectamine 2000 by intranasally. 24 h inoculation. Then mice were infected with SARS-CoV-2 intranasally, please refer to the SARS-CoV-2 mouse section. Then mice were euthanized with CO 2 and perfusion with PBS. The full lungs were removed, washed twice with PBS and RPMI-1640(GIBCO). Then were cut the whole lungs as small pieces put with 4ml digestion buffer (RPMI-1640+10mg/mL Collagen D +10mg/mL DNase1, 5% FBS) for 30mins, then the tissues were minced with 10ml syringe, and pass through with 70uM cell- strainer. Cells then spin it down and wash twice with D-PBS at 650 g at 4°C for 5mins. The red cells were lysis with ACK buffer (Thermo fisher, Cat#A1049201) for 2mins, Cells then spin it down and wash twice with D-PBS at 650 g at 4°C for 5mins. Collagen D (Worthington Biochemical, Cat# LS004210), DNase1(Sigma-Aldrich, Cat# 11284932001).
Cells were stained with trypan blue and counted. 10 6 Cells will used for full antibodies panel staining. 10 5 cells were used for live/dead staining for 15mins (eFluor 506 Fix Viability, eBioscience, Cat#65-0866-14), single antibody or unstaining cells or all antibodies. Mouse Fc block (BD PharMingen, Cat#553141) were diluted in D-PBS. Antibodies was diluted in 1:100 in BD brilliant stain buffer (BD Biosciences, Cat#563794). After all steps staining were completed, cells were fixed with 2% PFA for 30mins at 4°C, then washed with D-PBS for two times.
Samples were resuspended in 300ul FACS buffer (D-PBS +0.2% BSA +2mMEDTA). Samples were run in the BD Aries 3 and analyzed with Flowjo software.
Antibody panels ( key resources table ) and gating method are described in detail in Figure S2 .
Mice tissues were collected and homogenized in 1 mL Trizol reagents (Ambion). Total RNAs were extracted, 1mg treated with Dnase1(NEB). Then the mRNAs were purified by polyA beads, mRNaseq libraries were prepared by following the instruction with KAPA Biosciences. Then mRNaseq libraries were pooled and sequenced by Illumina HiSeq 4000 with single read in the UCSF core facility (Center for Advanced Technology, https://uccore.org/ucsf-center-for-advanced-technology/ ).
Differential gene and transcript expression analysis of mRNA-seq experiments with TopHat-Cufflinks-Cuffdiff pipeline ( Trapnell et al., 2012 93. Trapnell, C. ∙ Roberts, A. ∙ Goff, L. ... Differential gene and transcript expression analysis of RNA-seq experiments with TopHat and Cufflinks Nat. Protoc. 2012; 7 :562-578 Google Scholar ). The Figures were plot by R, ggplot2 package. Annotation of type I ISGs was based on Liu et al. (PMID https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22371602/ ) for IFNα and Gene Ontology (GO) Biological Process “Response to interferon-beta” for IFNβ. For direct comparisons between eTIP1 particles and LNPs, transcripts were filtered for statistical significance in both datasets. Fisher enrichment analyses was performed in Perseus version 1.6.7.0, using GO annotations and the above type I ISG list. Analyses were performed separately for statistically significant transcripts that are induced (log2(FC)>0) or depleted (log2(FC)<0), and the results were filtered for intersection > 9 and enrichment > 5.
Data were presented as mean ± SD. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software). Statistical significance was calculated using a two-tailed Student’s t test and p value < 0.05 was considered significant. Significance is noted with asterisks as described in the figure legends. Animal experiments were not blinded or randomized, and no animals or samples were removed as outliers from the analysis. The 50% Lethal dose (LD50) and Survival curves were compared with Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test methods performed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software). p value < 0.05 was considered significant.
