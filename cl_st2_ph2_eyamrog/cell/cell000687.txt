Title: The primordial differentiation of tumor-specific memory CD8 + T cells as bona fide responders to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade in draining lymph nodes


Abstract: Summary

Blocking PD-1/PD-L1 signaling transforms cancer therapy and is assumed to unleash exhausted tumor-reactive CD8 + T cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME). However, recent studies have also indicated that the systemic tumor-reactive CD8 + T cells may respond to PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy. These discrepancies highlight the importance of further defining tumor-specific CD8 + T cell responders to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. Here, using multiple preclinical tumor models, we revealed that a subset of tumor-specific CD8 + cells in the tumor draining lymph nodes (TdLNs) was not functionally exhausted but exhibited canonical memory characteristics. TdLN-derived tumor-specific memory (T TSM ) cells established memory-associated epigenetic program early during tumorigenesis. More importantly, TdLN-T TSM cells exhibited superior anti-tumor therapeutic efficacy after adoptive transfer and were characterized as bona fide responders to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. These findings highlight that TdLN-T TSM cells could be harnessed to potentiate anti-tumor immunotherapy.

Section: Introduction

The long-term persistence by antigen independent self-renewal, potent proliferative burst and rapid conversion into effector CD8 + T cells upon antigen reencounter constitute the canonical characteristics of memory CD8 + T cells developed from acute viral infection ( Ahmed and Gray, 1996 2. Ahmed, R. ∙ Gray, D. Immunological memory and protective immunity: understanding their relation Science. 1996; 272 :54-60 Crossref Scopus (1489) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kaech and Wherry, 2007 36.

However, chronic viral infection or cancer generally drives the differentiation of exhausted CD8 + T cells, which lose memory differentiation potential and exhibit hierarchical functional deficits ( McLane et al., 2019 50.

Rev. Immunol. 2022; 22 :209-223 Crossref Scopus (398) PubMed Google Scholar ). Concomitantly, exhausted CD8 + T cells upregulate an array of coinhibitory receptors, such as PD-1, Tim-3, and TIGIT ( McLane et al., 2019 50. McLane, L.M. ∙ Abdel-Hakeem, M.S. ∙ Wherry, E.J.

Immune-checkpoint blockade (ICB) targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway mediates durable remissions in a subset of cancer patients, with these effects generally attributed to the reversal of CD8 + T cell exhaustion in tumor microenvironment (TME) ( Brahmer et al., 2012 8.

However, not all exhausted CD8 + T cells can respond to PD-1/PD-L1 ICB ( Kallies et al., 2020 37. Kallies, A. ∙ Zehn, D. ∙ Utzschneider, D.T.

Exhausted CD8 + T cells within the TME are highly heterogeneous, at least comprising subsets of progenitors of exhausted T (T PEX ) cells and terminally exhausted CD8 + T (T EX ) cells ( He et al., 2016 29.

The draining lymph nodes (dLNs) accommodate systemic CD8 + T cell responses, which have been implicated in the efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 ICB in tumors ( Buchwald et al., 2020 10.

However, in tumor dLNs (TdLNs), the differentiation state of tumor-reactive CD8 + T cells and their potential responses to ICB remain largely unknown.

Section: Results

To characterize the differentiation of tumor-specific CD8 + T cells in TdLNs, C57BL/6J (hereafter referred to as B6) mice were subcutaneously engrafted with B16F10 cells expressing the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) glycoprotein (hereafter referred to as B16.Gp cells). Then, naive P14 cells (CD44 − GFP + , GFP indicatingTCF-1 expression) harboring transgenic TCRs specific to H-2D b Gp33-41 epitope from P14- Tcf7 (encoding TCF-1 protein)-GFP-P14 reporter mice ( Figure S1 A) were adoptively transferred and activated CD44 + P14 cells ( Figure S1 B) were analyzed longitudinally. Notably, nearly all activated P14 cells in the TdLNs exhibited high levels of the TF TCF-1 expression at all time points examined ( Figures 1 A and 1B). Furthermore, the number of TCF-1 + P14 cells in the TdLNs reached a peak on D8 post cell transfer and remained steady afterward ( Figure 1 C).
Besides naive T cells, memory CD8 + T cells also abundantly express TCF-1 ( Zhao et al., 2022 83. Zhao, X. ∙ Shan, Q. ∙ Xue, H.H. TCF1 in T cell immunity: a broadened frontier Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2022; 22 :147-157 Crossref Scopus (104) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhou et al., 2010 84. Zhou, X. ∙ Yu, S. ∙ Zhao, D.M. ... Differentiation and persistence of memory CD8(+) T cells depend on T cell factor 1 Immunity. 2010; 33 :229-240 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (502) PubMed Google Scholar ). We next examined whether tumor-specific TCF1 + CD8 + T cells in the TdLNs possessed certain characteristics of memory T (T MEM ) cells. Remarkably, TCF-1-expressing GFP + P14 cells in the TdLNs expressed canonical T MEM -associated markers, including IL7Rα (CD127), IL2Rβ (CD122) and CD62L, while P14 cells from the TME, including TCF-1 + T PEX cells, barely expressed these memory signatures ( Figures 1 D and 1E). Furthermore, the abundance of memory related TF Eomes was even higher in TdLN-P14 cells than in conventional memory counterparts ( Figures 1 F and 1G).
Moreover, TdLN-derived P14 cells produced comparable TNF-α, IFN-γ, and CD107 production to conventional memory P14 cells upon rechallenge with recombinant Listeria monocytogenes expressing the LCMV-GP 33–41 epitope (Lm-Gp 33–41 ), while TME-derived P14 cells showed lower cytokine production and degranulation ( Figure S1 C). Consistently, we found that TdLN-derived P14 cells conferred similar protective immunity as their conventional memory counterparts upon Lm-Gp 33–41 rechallenge, while TME-derived P14 cells failed to provide robust protection to recipients ( Figures 1 H and 1I).
Long-term persistence and potent proliferative burst upon antigen reencounter, two fundamental features of T MEM cells, may account for the protective immunity mediated by TdLN-derived P14 cells. To test this point, we co-transferred cell tracer-labeled TdLN-derived P14 cells (CD45.1 + CD45.2 + ) with TME-derived P14 cells (CD45.1 + CD45.2 − ) or with conventional T MEM P14 cells (CD45.1 + CD45.2 − ) into naive recipients ( Figure 1 J). On day 20 post transfer, we found that TdLN-derived P14 cells and T MEM P14 cells underwent similar homeostatic proliferation, while TME-derived counterparts exhibited minimal homeostatic proliferation ( Figure 1 K). Consequently, the ratio between TdLN-derived P14 cells and T MEM P14 cells was maintained approximately at 1:1 ratio on both day 20 and day 240, while TME-derived P14 cells almost vanished on day 240 post transfer ( Figure 1 L). Next, we sought to examine whether TdLN-derived P14 cells can undergo a proliferative burst upon antigenic re-stimulation. To this end, we sorted TdLN-derived P14 cells, TME-derived P14 cells, and T MEM P14 cells and transferred them separately into naive B6 recipients, followed by LCMV Armstrong strain (LCMV-Arm + ) rechallenge after resting for 3 months ( Figure 1 M). We visualized approximately 15-fold increase in the number of TdLN-derived P14 cells and T MEM P14 cells; however, TME-derived P14 cells were unable to expand upon rechallenge ( Figure 1 N). Collectively, these results demonstrated that TdLN-derived P14 cells phenotypically and functionally resembled canonical T MEM cells.
Furthermore, we noted that both TdLN-derived P14 cells and T MEM P14 cells lacked effector molecules KLRG1 and granzyme B expression ( Figures 2 A and 2B). Compared with classic T MEM cells, TdLN-derived P14 cells maintained a low level of PD-1 expression ( Figures 2 C–2E). However, they scarcely expressed other exhaustion-associated molecules, such as Tim-3, CD39, and Lag3 ( Figures 2 F and 2G).
Compared with TdLN-derived P14 cells, TCF-1 + T PEX P14 cells differentiated either in the TME or during chronic infection barely expressed memory markers CD122, CD127, and CD62L but substantially expressed key exhaustion markers PD-1 and TOX ( Figures 2 H–2J). These results together demonstrated that TdLN-derived tumor-specific CD8 + T cells were phenotypically different from TME-T PEX cells.
Furthermore, we validated that the initial transfer of different number of naive P14 cells (GFP + CD44 − ) prior to B16.Gp cell engraftment had little influence on the memory properties of TdLN-derived P14 cells ( Figures S1 D–S1H). We further confirmed that non-TCR-transgenic, endogenous tumor epitope (H-2D b GP 33–41 ) specific CD8 + T cells in the TdLNs also displayed typical memory phenotypes ( Figures S1 I and S1J).
To define the unique molecular traits of TdLN-derived tumor-specific CD8 + T cells, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of P14 cells from the TdLNs and TME of B16.Gp engrafted mice. Conventional T MEM P14 cells (day 200 post-acute LCMV-Arm + infection) and exhausted GP 33–41 tetramer-positive CD8 + T cells (D28 post Cl13 infection, GEO: GSE122713 ) ( Miller et al., 2019 53. Miller, B.C. ∙ Sen, D.R. ∙ Al Abosy, R. ... Subsets of exhausted CD8 + T cells differentially mediate tumor control and respond to checkpoint blockade Nat. Immunol. 2019; 20 :326-336 Crossref Scopus (1090) PubMed Google Scholar ) were introduced as controls. Additionally, the external scRNA-seq datasets (GEO: GSE182509 ) of GP 33–41 specific CD8 + T cells from TdLNs at 8- or 17-week post tumor induction (LN-8W/17W) in a lentivirus induced KRAS mutant and P53 loss associated lung adenocarcinoma (K/P LUAD) model ( Connolly et al., 2021 18. Connolly, K.A. ∙ Kuchroo, M. ∙ Venkat, A. ... A reservoir of stem-like CD8(+) T cells in the tumor-draining lymph node preserves the ongoing antitumor immune response Sci. Immunol. 2021; 6 :eabg7836 78 Crossref Scopus (146) PubMed Google Scholar ) were also incorporated. Totally, 22,376 cells from 6 samples were further categorized into seven major clusters ( Figures 3 A, 3B, S2 A, and S2B). We found that TdLN-P14 cells and T MEM P14 cells commingled and were generally distributed in clusters 1 and 2, while exhausted CD8 + T cells were mainly categorized into clusters 4–7 ( Figures 3 A, 3B, S2 B, and S2C). The majority of tetramer-specific CD8 + T cells from the TdLNs of LUAD mice were distributed in clusters 1–3 ( Figures 3 A, 3B, S2 B, and S2C). In agreement with this clustering, principal-component analysis (PCA) applied to the pseudo-bulk RNA-seq data of each scRNA-seq sample further highlighted that TdLN-derived tumor-specific CD8 + T cells from both B16.Gp and LUAD bearing mice and conventional T MEM cells were more closely neighbored but explicitly distal from exhausted CD8 + T cells from chronic LCMV-Cl13 infection or B16.Gp TME ( Figure 3 C).
We next investigated the differentially expressed genes across the 7 clusters to define subpopulation-specific transcriptional signatures. Cluster 1, termed as memory T cells 1 (T TMEM 1), highly expressed genes characteristic of central memory T cells (T CM ) ( Il7r , Ccr7 , Sell , Tcf7 , Lef1 , and Foxp1 ) ( Feng et al., 2011 23. Feng, X. ∙ Wang, H. ∙ Takata, H. ... Transcription factor Foxp1 exerts essential cell-intrinsic regulation of the quiescence of naive T cells Nat. Immunol. 2011; 12 :544-550 Crossref Scopus (144) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cluster 2, termed as memory T cells 2 (T MEM 2), also enriched similar memory signatures, while displayed higher level of Cd69 ( Figures 3 A, 3D, 3E, and S2 D). We also observed that clusters T MEM 1 and T MEM 2 accounted for about 50% of tumor-specific CD8 + T cells in TdLNs at 8 weeks after tumor induction, while declined to less than 20% at 17 weeks after LUAD induction ( Figures 3 A and 3B). Cluster 3 was defined as the T PEX subset due to the co-expression of Tcf7 and Tox , encompassing both TdLN- and TME-derived T PEX cells ( Figures 3 A, 3D, 3E, S2 C, and S2D). Clusters 4–6 expressed genes encoding inhibitory receptors ( Pdcd1 , Entpd1 , and Havcr2 ) and the exhaustion-related TFs Id2 and Tox ( Figures 3 A, 3D, 3E, and S2 D). Consistent with this, antigen-specific CD8 + T cells from LCMV-Cl13 infection and TME were predominantly distributed into these clusters ( Figures 3 A, 3B, S2 B, and S2C). Cluster 4 was distinguished from other subsets by Cx3cr1 expression ( Figure 3 E), a marker for proliferating transitory exhausted CD8 + T cells ( Hudson et al., 2019 30. Hudson, W.H. ∙ Gensheimer, J. ∙ Hashimoto, M. ... Proliferating transitory T cells with an effector-like transcriptional signature emerge from PD-1(+) stem-like CD8(+) T cells during chronic infection Immunity. 2019; 51 1043–1058.e4 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (350) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistently, genes encoding effector molecules ( Klrg1 , Klrc1 , Gzmb , Gzma , and Ifng ) were also enriched in cluster 4 ( Figures 3 A, 3D, 3E, and S2 D). Clusters 5 and 6 were further categorized as terminally (T EX ) and intermediate (Int-T EX ) exhausted subsets, respectively, according to the upregulated levels of Pdcd1 , Lag3 , Entpd1 , Cd160 , and Tox ( Figures 3 A, 3D, and 3E). Cluster 7 mainly expressed cell-cycle genes ( Cdc45 , Mki67 , and Clspn ) ( Figures 3 A, 3B, and S2 B–S2D).
Furthermore, clusters 1 and 2 showed significant enrichment of gene ontology (GO) terms related to T cell proliferation involved in the immune response, likely reflecting a better proliferative potential of T MEM cells and TdLN-derived tumor-specific CD8 + T cells ( Figure S2 E). Clusters 4–6 showed preferential enrichment in GO terms reflecting the functions of cytotoxicity and negative regulation of T cell activation, consistent with the individual gene expression data and sample distribution ( Figures 3 D, 3E, S2 D, and S2E).
Next, we re-clustered TdLN-P14 cells and conventional T MEM P14 cells (see details in STAR Methods ) to explore the transcriptional differences that could distinguish these two populations. We obtained two robust subclusters, representing distinct distributions for TdLN-derived P14 cells (subcluster 1) and T MEM P14 cells (subcluster 2), further confirmed by different clustering approaches and the distinct transcriptional signatures ( Figures 3 F, 3G, and S2 F–S2I). Notably, subcluster 1 exhibited upregulation of activation-related transcripts such as Junb , Cd69 , and Stat1 . By contrast, memory-associated genes ( Il2rb , Il7r , Bcl2 , and Ccl5 ) ( Marçais et al., 2006 48. Marçais, A. ∙ Tomkowiak, M. ∙ Walzer, T. ... Maintenance of CCL5 mRNA stores by post-effector and memory CD8 T cells is dependent on transcription and is coupled to increased mRNA stability Eur. J. Immunol. 2006; 36 :2745-2754 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ) were more enriched in subcluster 2 ( Figures S2 H and S2I). Remarkably, Ccl5 expression was specifically confined to subcluster 2 ( Figures 3 H, S2 H, S2I, and S2K), further confirmed at the protein level ( Figure 3 I). Moreover, Cd69/Junb exhibited a mutually exclusive expression pattern with Ccl5 ( Figures S2 L–S2O). Additionally, GO terms including T cell extravasation and chemotaxis were less enriched in subcluster 1 ( Figure S2 J), indicating the potentially distinct circulating features between these two subsets.
Next, we compared the chromatin accessibility regions (ChARs) of TdLN-P14 cells (days 4, 8, and 21 post adoptive cell transfer) with other CD8 + T cell subsets. PCA analysis identified that TdLN-derived P14 cells from three time points were highly identical to each other in terms of the epigenetic profile but differed from the remaining subsets ( Figure S3 A). We identified 6,316 loci with differential ChARs between TdLN-derived P14 cells and the other subsets. Hierarchical clustering of those loci showed that the TdLN-derived P14 subsets from different time points established identical epigenetic landscapes as early as Day 4 and maintained afterward, which clearly distinguished TdLN-derived P14 subset from T MEM , T MP , T EFF , T PEX , and T EX subsets ( Figure S3 B). Cluster 1 included a large number (36% of 6,316 loci) of open ChARs almost unique to the TdLN-P14 subsets, which were significantly mapped to proximal genes related to the functions of T cell activation, cytokine production, and lymphocyte differentiation ( Figures S3 B and S3C). Moreover, the TdLN-P14 cells shared certain open chromatin loci with the T PEX subset in cluster 2 (613 of 6,316 loci) and the T MEM subset in cluster 6 (660 of 6,316 loci) ( Figure S3 B) but were excluded from sharing open chromatin loci with T EX (cluster 4) and T EFF (cluster 5) subsets ( Figure S3 B). At peaks more open in TdLN-P14 cells, we found motifs for members of the ETS, Runx, and HMG Box TF families to be the most significantly enriched. The top hits encompassed RUNX1, RUNX2, ETS1, ELKs, and TCF7L2 ( Figure S3 D), most of which are associated with T MEM differentiation ( Chang et al., 2014 13. Chang, J.T. ∙ Wherry, E.J. ∙ Goldrath, A.W. Molecular regulation of effector and memory T cell differentiation Nat. Immunol. 2014; 15 :1104-1115 Crossref Scopus (426) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kaech and Cui, 2012 35. Kaech, S.M. ∙ Cui, W. Transcriptional control of effector and memory CD8+ T cell differentiation Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2012; 12 :749-761 Crossref Scopus (1114) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Additionally, open chromatin peaks were found at the transcription start sites (TSSs) and/or its proximal loci of genes related to memory properties ( Tcf7 and Il7r ) in TdLN-P14 cells, T MEM P14 cells, and T MP P14 cells but not in T EX or T EFF subsets ( Figures S3 G and S3H). Genes encoding inhibitory receptors ( Pdcd1 and Havcr2 ) were less open in those subsets with memory properties, while became more accessible during the transition from T EFF to T EX subsets ( Figures S3 I and S3J). Notably, the TdLN-derived P14 subset had greater chromatin accessibility at the TSS of Cd69 than did other subsets but less chromatin accessibility at the TSS of Ccl5 ( Figures S3 E and S3F), further corroborating both genes as core transcriptional signatures for distinguishing TdLN-P14 cells from conventional T MEM cells.
TCF1 + T PEX cells were also recently identified in TdLNs of LUAD mice ( Connolly et al., 2021 18. Connolly, K.A. ∙ Kuchroo, M. ∙ Venkat, A. ...

As an exhaustion-specific TF, TOX is predominantly expressed by both TCF-1 + T PEX cells and TCF-1 − T EX cells, but not by memory subsets ( Alfei et al., 2019 4.

Single-cell RNA-seq reveals TOX as a key regulator of CD8 + T cell persistence in chronic infection Nat. Immunol. 2019; 20 :890-901 Crossref Scopus (330) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistently, we have observed that around 20% of TdLN-derived TCF + P14 cells expressed exhaustion-specific marker TOX in B16.Gp bearing mice ( Figures 2 F and S1 H). The presence of both TCF1 + TOX − and TCF1 + TOX + subsets was further recapitulated in endogenous TdLN-derived tumor-specific CD8 + T cells ( Figures S1 I and S1J).
To further compare endogenous tumor-specific TCF1 + TOX − CD8 + T cells and TCF1 + TOX + counterparts in TdLNs of non-subcutaneous tumor models, we set up mouse model of K/P LUAD expressing ovalbumin (OVA) ( Connolly et al., 2021 18. Connolly, K.A. ∙ Kuchroo, M. ∙ Venkat, A. ... A reservoir of stem-like CD8(+) T cells in the tumor-draining lymph node preserves the ongoing antitumor immune response Sci. Immunol. 2021; 6 :eabg7836 78 Crossref Scopus (146) PubMed Google Scholar ; Schenkel et al., 2021) ( Figure 4 A). We observed the presence of both OVA 257–264 H-2K b tetramer + TCF1 + TOX − and TCF1 + TOX + CD8 + T cell subsets in TdLNs ( Figure 4 B), and the former exhibited memory phenotypes, evidenced by higher levels of memory-associated markers CD122, CD127, and CD62L but relatively lower expression of PD-1 than TCF1 + TOX + TdLN-T PEX cells ( Figure 4 C).
Based on their phenotypic characteristics of canonical T MEM cells, we reasoned that tumor-specific TCF1 + TOX − CD8 + T cells in TdLNs likely represented a distinct memory T cell subset, which was termed as TdLN-residing tumor-specific memory T (TdLN-T TSM ) cells thereafter. Accordingly, tumor-specific TCF-1 + TOX + CD8 + T cells in TdLNs were named as TdLN-T PEX cells based on TCF-1 and TOX co-expression. To further validate TdLN-T TSM cells, but not TdLN-T PEX cells, as a bona fide memory T cell subset, we compared both subsets in terms of canonical memory properties. First, we observed that PD-1 expression was positively correlated with TOX expression in TdLN-derived P14 cells, which can be used as a surrogate for TOX expression when sorting TdLN-P14 cells ( Figures S4 A and S4B). Subsequently, we co-transferred TdLN-T TSM P14 cells with TdLN-T PEX or TME-T PEX P14 cells or with conventional T MEM P14 cells into naive B6 recipients at 1:1 ratio ( Figure 4 D). On day 60 post transfer, we found that both TdLN-T TSM and T MEM -P14 cells underwent more pronounced homeostatic proliferation than did TdLN- and TME-T PEX counterparts ( Figures 4 E and 4F). Consequently, the ratio between TdLN-T TSM and T MEM cells was maintained approximately at 1:1 ratio, while the ratio of TdLN- or TME-T PEX to TdLN-T TSM was profoundly decreased on D60 post transfer ( Figures 4 G and 4H). Moreover, to evaluate the proliferative potential of TdLN-T TSM cells upon rechallenge, TdLN-T TSM , TdLN-T PEX , and T MEM P14 cells were sorted and transferred separately into naive recipients with the same number, which were then rechallenged with LCMV-Arm + ( Figure 4 I). At 7 days post rechallenge, we visualized 150- to 180-fold increase in the number of TdLN-T TSM cells and T MEM P14 cells, while only about 40-fold increase was observed in TdLN-derived T PEX cells ( Figures 4 J and 4K). Consistently, we found that TdLN-T TSM P14 cells conferred much stronger protection against Lm-Gp 33–41 rechallenge than both TdLN-T PEX P14 cells and TME-T PEX P14 cells, while equivalent to that mediated by conventional T MEM counterparts ( Figures 4 L–4N). Taken together, these results demonstrated that TdLN-T TSM cells, but not TdLN-T PEX cells, possessed canonical memory features.
Next, we performed ATAC-seq to examine whether TdLN-T TSM cells obtained a distinct epigenetic profile from TdLN-T PEX cells. PCA identified that TdLN-T TSM P14 cells substantially differed from TdLN-T PEX and Cl13-T PEX counterparts ( Jadhav et al., 2019 33. Jadhav, R.R. ∙ Im, S.J. ∙ Hu, B. ... Epigenetic signature of PD-1+ TCF1+ CD8 T cells that act as resource cells during chronic viral infection and respond to PD-1 blockade Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2019; 116 :14113-14118 Crossref Scopus (149) PubMed Google Scholar ) in open ChARs ( Figure S4 C). Furthermore, hierarchical clustering revealed that although TdLN-T TSM and TdLN-T PEX P14 cells largely shared open chromosome accessibility pattern in cluster 2 (3,736 loci) ( Figure S4 D) that contained memory-associated signatures ( Tcf7 , Bach2 , Foxp1 , Ccr7 , Sell , Id3 , and Lef1 ), they were distinguished by cluster 4 (5,257 loci) that comprised exhaustion molecules, including Pdcd1 , Tox , Id2 , Havcr2 , Ctla4 , and Lag3 ( Figure S4 D). Consistently, GO analysis revealed that cluster 2 was mapped to gene loci associated with survival and positive regulation of activation, differentiation, and cytokine, whereas cluster 4 was enriched in gene loci related to programmed cell death and negative regulation of cytokine production and immune process ( Figure S4 E). Furthermore, we found binding motifs for several members of the ETS, Runx, and HMG Box TF families to be the most significantly enriched in cluster 2 ( Figure S4 F), most of which are associated with memory CD8 + T cell differentiation ( Chang et al., 2014 13. Chang, J.T. ∙ Wherry, E.J. ∙ Goldrath, A.W. Molecular regulation of effector and memory T cell differentiation Nat. Immunol. 2014; 15 :1104-1115 Crossref Scopus (426) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kaech and Cui, 2012 35. Kaech, S.M. ∙ Cui, W. Transcriptional control of effector and memory CD8+ T cell differentiation Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2012; 12 :749-761 Crossref Scopus (1114) PubMed Google Scholar ). By contrast, cluster 4 significantly enriched AP-1 complex-related and EGR family motifs ( Figure S4 F), in keeping with the regulatory role of AP-1 family TFs in T cell exhaustion ( Martinez et al., 2015 49. Martinez, G.J. ∙ Pereira, R.M. ∙ Aijo, T. ... The transcription factor NFAT promotes exhaustion of activated CD8 + T cells Immunity. 2015; 42 :265-278 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (514) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistently, chromatin accessibility profiles of individual genes associated with T cell memory ( Tcf7 , Ccr7 , Sell , Id3 , and Lef1 ) were largely comparable among these three subsets, while those with exhaustion-related gene signatures ( Pdcd1 , Havcr2 , and Tox ) clearly distinguished the TdLN-T TSM subset from TdLN-T PEX and Cl-13 T PEX subsets ( Figures 4 O, 4P, and S4 I–S4N).
Recently, several studies demonstrated that virus-specific T PEX cells were irreversibly associated with epigenetic scarring on the loci of important exhaustion regulators, including Tox and Pdcd1 ( Abdel-Hakeem et al., 2021 1. Abdel-Hakeem, M.S. ∙ Manne, S. ∙ Beltra, J.C. ... Epigenetic scarring of exhausted T cells hinders memory differentiation upon eliminating chronic antigenic stimulation Nat. Immunol. 2021; 22 :1008-1019 Crossref Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tonnerre et al., 2021 67. Tonnerre, P. ∙ Wolski, D. ∙ Subudhi, S. ... Differentiation of exhausted CD8(+) T cells after termination of chronic antigen stimulation stops short of achieving functional T cell memory Nat. Immunol. 2021; 22 :1030-1041 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yates et al., 2021 79. Yates, K.B. ∙ Tonnerre, P. ∙ Martin, G.E. ... Epigenetic scars of CD8 + T cell exhaustion persist after cure of chronic infection in humans Nat. Immunol. 2021; 22 :1020-1029 Crossref Scopus (124) PubMed Google Scholar ). In tumor scenario, we observed that TdLN-T TSM cells were not marked by epigenetic scars at Tox and Pdcd1 loci, while TdLN-T PEX cells, together with Cl13-T PEX cells and recovered T EX cells (REC-T EX, recovered from antigen removal) ( Abdel-Hakeem et al., 2021 1. Abdel-Hakeem, M.S. ∙ Manne, S. ∙ Beltra, J.C. ... Epigenetic scarring of exhausted T cells hinders memory differentiation upon eliminating chronic antigenic stimulation Nat. Immunol. 2021; 22 :1008-1019 Crossref Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar ) exhibited epigenetic scars at both Tox and Pdcd1 loci ( Figures 4 O and 4P). Consequently, TdLN-T PEX cells could not differentiate into authentic effector cells after antigen removal and ensuing antigen rechallenge, shown by profoundly compromised KLRG1 expression and the differentiation into IFN-γ + /TNF-α + effector cells as compared with both TdLN-T TSM cells and conventional T MEM cells, while still maintaining high PD-1 and TOX expression ( Figures S4 G and S4H).
Collectively, these data strengthened the notion that TdLN-T TSM cells were bona fide memory T cells, while TdLN-T PEX cells were epigenetically defined as an exhaustion subset due to epigenetic scarring.
Next, we sought to explore the existence of TdLN-T TSM cells in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Toward this end, we first sorted activated CD8 + T cells potentially comprising tumor-reactive memory CD8 + T cells from TdLNs by using CD45RA − CD8 + CCR7 + PD-1 dim gating strategy and putative tumor-reactive exhausted CD8 + T cells from paired TME by using CD45RA − CD8 + PD-1 + CD39 + gating strategy to exclude bystander CD8 + T cells ( Simoni et al., 2018 63. Simoni, Y. ∙ Becht, E. ∙ Fehlings, M. ... Bystander CD8 + T cells are abundant and phenotypically distinct in human tumour infiltrates Nature. 2018; 557 :575-579 Crossref Scopus (867) PubMed Google Scholar ) and then performed scRNA-seq and sc-TCR sequencing to investigate the transcriptional profiles of the TCR clones shared between paired samples. We noticed that those sorted cells displayed enormous heterogeneity and were categorized into 9 distinct subsets ( Figures S5 A, S5B, and S5D), and both T MEM and T PEX subsets were shown in the sorted TdLN-derived CD8 + T cells ( Figures S5 B–S5E). Then we used the TCRα- and β-chain sequences ( Table S2 ) as clonal markers to trace shared CD8 + T cell clones between paired TdLNs and TME. Only those clones with identical TCRα- and β-chain sequences shared by TdLN- and TME-derived CD8 + T cells from the same patient and expanded at least twice in TME samples were regarded as reactive to tumor antigens ( Figures S5 F and S5G). We obtained 207 TCR clonotypes concomitantly shown up in paired TdLNs and TME, representing 1,165 and 2,203 CD8 + T cells from TdLNs and TME, respectively ( Figures S5 G and S5H). These shared TCR clones were clearly categorized into three clusters ( Figure 5 A). Based on TCF7 and TOX expression, cluster 1 was assigned as T TSM like ( TCF7 + TOX − ), while clusters 2 and 3 as T PEX ( TCF7 + TOX + ) and T EX ( TCF7 − TOX + ), respectively ( Figure 5 A). The TCR clones derived from TdLNs were primarily grouped into cluster 1 ( Figures 5 A–5C), while the corresponding TCR clones from TME were preferably allocated into cluster 2 and 3 ( Figures 5 A–5C and S5 I). Notably, we observed about 30% of TCR clones in TdLNs were identified as T PEX cells by TCF7 and TOX co-expression (cluster 2) ( Figures 5 A–5C and S5 I), consistent with the results in mouse tumor models.
Furthermore, pseudotime trajectory analysis revealed that these shared TCR clones possessed a continuous differentiation trajectory that started from the clones predominantly derived of TdLNs toward the end of the clones from TME ( Figure 5 D). The TCR clones on early pseudotime exhibited a distinguishable memory-like phenotype, while the TCR clones on later pseudotime displayed a distinct exhaustion state ( Figure 5 E). TCF7 and CCR7 underwent gradual decreases in expression levels along the pseudotime trajectory ( Figure 5 F). Conversely, representative exhaustion markers ( TOX and LAG3 ) and markers associated with T cell activation ( JUNB , CD69 , and STAT1 ) progressively increased along the pseudotime trajectory ( Figure 5 F).
To potentially prove the antigenic specificity of those TdLN-derived T TSM -like cells in HCC, we cloned TCR sequences from top 6 expanded clones in cluster 1 (representing memory properties) ( Figure 5 A; Table S3 ), each of which was shared by CD8 + T cells in paired TME and TdLNs. We ectopically expressed the selected TCR sequences in the autologous blood-derived CD8 + T cells with lenti-virus transduction system. Then, the transduced CD8 + T cells were sorted and co-cultured with autologous tumor cells for 18–20 h ( Figure 5 G). We observed that over 80% of transfected CD8 + T cells expressed selected TCRs ( Figure S5 J), and 5 out of the 6 selected TCR clonotypes were proved to be specifically recognizing their autologous tumor cells, evidenced by IFN-γ production and increased expression of 4-1BB of these TCR-transduced cells when co-cultured with autologous tumor cells ( Figures 5 H–5I and S5 K). Taken together, these multiple lines of evidence demonstrated the existence of TdLN-T TSM cells in human cancer.
Next, we examined the differentiation relationship between TdLN-T TSM cells and TdLN-T PEX cells during tumor progression. To this end, TdLN-T TSM P14 cells and TdLN-T PEX P14 cells were separately transferred into tumor-matched B6 mice ( Figure S6 A). At D8 post cell transfer, we found that a fraction of transferred TdLN-T TSM P14 cells differentiated into TdLN-T PEX ones, but not vice versa, suggesting TdLN-T TSM cells as precursors of TdLN-T PEX cells ( Figure S6 B). Furthermore, more TdLN-T TSM derived progeny cells were recovered within blood and TME of recipient mice than TdLN-T PEX derived ones ( Figure S6 C). In blood, TdLN-T TSM derived P14 cells maintained higher expression of memory markers, including TCF1, CD62L, CD127, and CD122, than the counterparts derived from TdLN-T PEX subset; however, in the TME, most of the progeny P14 cells from donor-derived both TdLN-T TSM and TdLN-T PEX P14 cells finally differentiated into TCF1 − TOX + T EX cells ( Figures S6 D and S6E). Given TdLN-T TSM cells as precursors of TdLN-T PEX cells, these results together suggested a linear differentiation mode between TdLN-T TSM , TdLN-T PEX , TME-T PEX , and T EX subsets during tumorigenesis.
Next, we assessed anti-tumor therapeutic effects of TdLN-derived T TSM cells when adoptively transferred. Toward this end, sorted TdLN-derived T TSM OT1 cells, T PEX OT1 cells (specifically recognizing H-2K b OVA 257–264 ), and TME-derived T EX OT1 cells were adoptively transferred into B16.OVA bearing Cd8 −/− mice, and tumor volume was monitored ( Figure 6 A). TdLN-T TSM cells exhibited the most pronouncing capacity in tumor repression among these three populations, and TdLN-T PEX OT1 cells showed relatively better anti-tumor efficacy than T EX cells ( Figures 6 B and 6C), coincident with previous studies ( Krishna et al., 2020 41. Krishna, S. ∙ Lowery, F.J. ∙ Copeland, A.R. ... Stem-like CD8 T cells mediate response of adoptive cell immunotherapy against human cancer Science. 2020; 370 :1328-1334 Crossref Scopus (273) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kurtulus et al., 2018 42. Kurtulus, S. ∙ Madi, A. ∙ Escobar, G. ... Checkpoint blockade immunotherapy induces dynamic changes in PD-1 − CD8 + tumor-infiltrating T cells Immunity. 2018; 50 181–194.e6 Google Scholar ; Sade-Feldman et al., 2018 57. Sade-Feldman, M. ∙ Yizhak, K. ∙ Bjorgaard, S.L. ... Defining T cell states associated with response to checkpoint immunotherapy in melanoma Cell. 2018; 176 :404 10 Crossref Google Scholar ; Siddiqui et al., 2019 62. Siddiqui, I. ∙ Schaeuble, K. ∙ Chennupati, V. ...

Moreover, tumor-bearing mice receiving TdLN-T TSM OT1 cells demonstrated a complete remission whereas their counterparts in other two groups were not able to survive at the endpoint of day 40 post tumor cell engraftment ( Figure 6 D). These results therefore highlighted that compared with TdLN-T PEX or TME-T EX cells, TdLN-T TSM cells were superior in controlling tumor growth when adoptively transferred and could be exploited as a promising strategy of adoptive T cell immunotherapy.
Finally, we sought to define whether TdLN-T TSM cells could respond to PD-1/PD-L1 ICB. To this end, an equal number of sorted TdLN-T TSM P14 cells and TdLN-T PEX P14 cells were re-transferred to B16.Gp tumor-matched mice, respectively, followed by anti-PD-L1 treatment at indicated time points ( Figure 7 A). At day 10 post cell transfer, we observed more prominent expansion of TdLN-T TSM derived-P14 cells than TdLN-T PEX derived ones upon the administration of anti-PD-L1 mAb, in both TdLNs and TME of recipient mice ( Figure 7 B). Similarly, TdLN-T TSM derived P14 cells exhibited more significant augmentation in quantity and cytokine production than TdLN-T PEX derived P14 cells upon treatment with anti-PD1 antibodies in vitro ( Figures S7 A–S7C), suggesting that TdLN-T TSM cells, rather than TdLN-T PEX P14 cells primarily responded to PD-1/PD-L1 ICB.
To further validate TdLN-T TSM cells as the principal responders to PD-L1 ICB, tumor mass from day 14 B16.Gp tumor-bearing mice (initially CD45.1 + CD45.2 − P14 cells transferred, donor) were surgically dissected and transplanted into TdLN-T TSM or TdLN-T PEX P14 cells (CD45.1 + CD45.2 + ) adoptively transferred tumor-bearing mice (recipient) ( Figure 7 C). As expected, we observed much greater ratio of TdLN-T TSM -derived P14 cells to donor-derived P14 cells than that of TdLN-T PEX derived P14 cells to donor-derived P14 cells in grafted tumor mass post PD-L1 ICB; consistently, anti-PD-L1 treatment led to more efficiently expanded TdLN-T TSM -cell-derived P14 cells than TdLN-T PEX derived counterparts in transplanted tumor mass ( Figures 7 D–7F). These data together established TdLN-T TSM cells as the principal responders to PD-L1 ICB.
Furthermore, we observed that PD-L1 ICB could not lead to enhanced number and BrdU incorporation of P14 cells in the TME when the dLNs were surgically removed ( Figures S7 D, S7G, and S7H). Provided TdLN-T TSM cells as the principal responders of PD-L1 ICB, these results indicated that PD-L1 ICB may exert its effect at least partially via expanding T TSM P14 cells in TdLNs. To further confirm this notion, B16.OVA bearing mice were first treated with one dose of anti-PD-L1 blocking antibody on day 3 after OT1 cell transfer, then these mice received intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of BrdU. 3 h later, half of the mice received lymphadenectomy of TdLNs while others received sham-operation, and the kinetics of BrdU + OT1 cells in TME were analyzed afterward at indicated time points ( Figure S7 E). Notably, we observed a continuous accumulation of BrdU-positive OT1 cells in the TME of mice received sham-operation upon anti-PD-L1 administration, while the proportion of BrdU + OT1 cells in mice of TdLN removal remained unchanged ( Figure S7 F), further supporting that PD-L1 ICB treatment expanded tumor-specific CD8 + T cells in TdLNs, rather than in TME. In line with these data, the tumor repressive capacity of anti-PD-L1 mAbs was almost abolished when TdLNs were surgically removed ( Figures 7 I and 7J). Remarkably, removal of TdLNs at any individual time point during anti-PD-L1 therapy almost abrogated the tumor-suppressive effects of anti-PD-L1 treatment in B16.Gp bearing mice ( Figures 7 K and 7L), which was further reproduced with MC38 tumor-bearing mice ( Figures S7 G and S7H). These results demonstrated that TdLN-residing tumor-specific CD8 + T cells were constantly required for the anti-tumor effectiveness of PD-L1 ICB.
To validate the importance of TdLN-residing tumor-specific CD8 + T cells in PD-L1 ICB, we treated B16.Gp tumor-bearing mice with ICBs through different routes, including i.p., intratumoral (i.t.), and intranodal (tumor-draining LN, i.n.) injection, by mixing blocking antibodies with Pluronic F127 hydrogel, which was proved to effectively limit encapsulated antibodies to exert therapeutic effects locally ( Almoshari et al., 2020 5. Almoshari, Y. ∙ Ren, R. ∙ Zhang, H. ... GSK3 inhibitor-loaded osteotropic pluronic hydrogel effectively mitigates periodontal tissue damage associated with experimental periodontitis Biomaterials. 2020; 261 :120293 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 7 M). We noticed that i.p. administration of anti-PD-L1 effectively repressed tumor growth, while the i.t. administration of anti-PD-L1 inefficiently restrained tumor growth; however, i.n. administration of anti-PD-L1 demonstrated comparable capacity in repressing tumor growth as i.p. administration. As a control, we found that i.t. administration of anti-CTLA4 effectively repressed tumor growth as i.p., consistent with published data ( Melero et al., 2021 52. Melero, I. ∙ Castanon, E. ∙ Alvarez, M. ... Intratumoural administration and tumour tissue targeting of cancer immunotherapies Nat. Rev. Clin. Oncol. 2021; 18 :558-576 Crossref Scopus (242) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 7 N). These data corroborated the notion that tumor-specific CD8 + T cells residing in TdLN were the predominant targets of PD-L1 ICB in exerting its therapeutic effects.
To further define the pivotal role of TdLN-T TSM cells in responding to PD-L1 ICB, we transferred bulk TdLN-T TSM cells into tumor-matched recipients that had undergone surgical excision of TdLNs. Following adoptive cell transfer, we treated these mice with anti-PD-L1 antibodies ( Figure 7 O). Consistently, lymphadenectomy abrogated the tumor-suppressive effects of PD-L1 ICB, while the adoptive transfer of TdLN-T TSM cells, but not TdLN-T PEX cells, efficiently rectified PD-L1 ICB mediated anti-tumor efficacy in tumor-bearing mice with lymphadenectomy ( Figure 7 P). These results together illuminated the importance of T TSM cells in responding to PD-L1 ICB in TdLNs.

Section: Discussion

In this study, we identified TCF1 + TOX − tumor-specific memory T (T TSM ) cells as a distinct subset of T MEM cells specifically developed in the TdLNs during tumorigenesis. The unique characteristics of primordial differentiation and epigenetic landscapes distinguished TdLN-T TSM cells from conventional T MEM cells.
Tumor-specific TCF1 + TOX − T TSM and TCF1 + TOX + T PEX cells were both found in TdLNs in K/P LUAD models ( Connolly et al., 2021 18. Connolly, K.A. ∙ Kuchroo, M. ∙ Venkat, A. ... A reservoir of stem-like CD8(+) T cells in the tumor-draining lymph node preserves the ongoing antitumor immune response Sci. Immunol. 2021; 6 :eabg7836 78 Crossref Scopus (146) PubMed Google Scholar ; Schenkel et al., 2021), supporting conclusions with subcutaneous B16.Gp models. The proportion of TdLN-T TSM ells seemed to be lower in K/P LUAD models than that in B16.Gp models, particularly at late stage of tumor progression, which may be attributed to the differential antigen priming or presentation in TdLNs of different tumor models. In K/P LUAD models, tumorigenesis was induced by lentiviral administration of Cre recombinase to the lung tissues of K/P mice, which also concomitantly transduced antigen-presenting cells (APCs), resulting in antigen expression by these transduced APCs per se ( DuPage et al., 2011 21.

Methods. 2021; 1 :100080 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ) that directly presented tumor antigens to tumor-specific CD8 + T cells in TdLNs prior to the onset of tumor lesions. Furthermore, at very late stage (like week 17) of tumor progression in K/P LUAD tumor model, tumor may metastasize to TdLNs ( Connolly et al., 2021 18. Connolly, K.A. ∙ Kuchroo, M. ∙ Venkat, A. ...

TdLN-residing T TSM cells are fundamentally different from TdLN-T PEX cells and TME-T PEX and T EX cells at the transcriptional and epigenetic levels. TdLN-T TSM cells do not express exhaustion-specific TF TOX ( Alfei et al., 2019 4. Alfei, F. ∙ Kanev, K. ∙ Hofmann, M. ...

More remarkably, in contrast to TdLN-T PEX cells, TdLN-T TSM cells were free of epigenetic scars at the regions of key genes regulating T cell exhaustion, such as Tox and Pdcd1 ( Abdel-Hakeem et al., 2021 1. Abdel-Hakeem, M.S. ∙ Manne, S. ∙ Beltra, J.C. ... Epigenetic scarring of exhausted T cells hinders memory differentiation upon eliminating chronic antigenic stimulation Nat.

Epigenetic scars of CD8 + T cell exhaustion persist after cure of chronic infection in humans Nat. Immunol. 2021; 22 :1020-1029 Crossref Scopus (124) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, TdLN-T TSM cells could differentiate into fully competent effector T cells as canonical T MEM cells. Together, these features establish TdLN-T TSM cells as a bona fide T MEM subset induced early during tumorigenesis. The molecular signals governing the primordial differentiation of T TSM cells in the TdLNs warrant further investigation.
This study provides compelling evidence to support the notion that TdLN-T TSM cells function as primary responders for PD-1/PD-L1 ICB. First, PD-L1 ICB efficiently expanded TdLN-T TSM cells, leading to the subsequent accumulation of T PEX and T EX cells in the TME. Second, i.n. administration of anti-PD-L1 mAb to the TdLNs effectively restrained tumor growth, whereas i.t. injection of the PD-L1mAb did not achieve appreciable tumor control. Third, surgical removal of the TdLNs abolished the anti-tumor efficacy of PD-L1 ICB, while adoptive transfer of TdLN-T TSM cells restored the tumor control in TdLN-resected recipients. Based on these points, we propose that PD-1/PD-L1 ICB may exert anti-tumor effects in a temporal and spatial manner: it first expands T TSM cells and further drives these cells to differentiate into T PEX cells in TdLNs; subsequently, TdLN-derived T PEX cells migrate to the periphery and finally differentiate into T EX cells in the TME, whereby ICB may sustain the effector function of these newly differentiated T EX cells to effectively execute tumor cells. However, such hypothesis needs to be further validated in preclinical tumor models and ICB responding cancer patients.
In conclusion, we identified the primordially differentiated T TSM subset in the TdLNs, which served as bona fide responders to PD-1/PD-L1 ICB. These findings provide an important rationale for harnessing TdLN-T TSM cells to potentiate ICB-based anti-tumor immunotherapy.
In this study, we did not characterize TdLN-T TSM cells in non-HCC human cancers. Additionally, the mechanisms underlying primordial TdLN-T TSM differentiation were not characterized. Furthermore, TdLN-T TSM cells as responders to PD-1-PD-L1 ICB in human cancer patients were not investigated.

C57BL/6J (referred as B6 mice), Cd 8 -/- mice, OTI transgenic mice (expressing a TCR specific for the OVA 257-264 peptide in the context of H-2K b ), CD45.1 + and CD45.2 + congenic mice (strain B6.SJL- Ptprc a Pepc b /BoyJ) were purchased from the Jackson Laboratories. K-ras LSL-G12D/+ mice and p53 fl/fl mice were gifted from Dr. Bo Zhong from Wuhan University. K-ras LSL-G12D/+ were crossed with p53 fl/fl mice to generate K-ras LSL-G12D/+ p53 fl/fl mice. P14 transgenic mice (carrying a transgenic T cell antigen receptor that recognizes H-2D b GP 33–41 epitope of LCMV virus) were gifted from Dr. Rafi. Ahmed (Emory University). Tcf7 -GFP knock-in mice were obtained with the strategy as we previously reported ( He et al., 2016 29. He, R. ∙ Hou, S. ∙ Liu, C. ... Follicular CXCR5- expressing CD8(+) T cells curtail chronic viral infection Nature. 2016; 537 :412-428 Crossref Scopus (475) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, an IRES-GFP construct was inserted after the open reading frame of Tcf7 (encoding TCF-1) by homologous recombination. A Neo cassette and diphtheria toxin were used as positive and negative selection markers in the targeting vector, respectively. Targeted embryonic stem clones were injected into C57BL/6J blastocysts to generate chimeras. Tcf7 -GFP knock-in reporter mice were obtained after deletion of Neo cassette by crossing with Cre-deleter mice, then bred to P14 or OT1 mice to generate P14- Tcf7 -GFP or OT1-Tcf7-GFP reporter mice. All mice were kept on a C57BL/6J background. All the mice used were analyzed at 6-10 weeks of age, and both genders were included without randomization or ‘‘blinding’’. All mice were housed in specific-pathogen free (SPF) condition. All mouse experiments and breeding conditions were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of the Third Military Medical University.
B16F10/B16.OVA cells and MC38 cells were purchased from ATCC. The LCMV Cl13 glycoprotein gene knock-in B16F10 cell line (herein referred as B16.Gp) was constructed by Beijing Biocytogen Co.Ltd, China. In brief, B16.Gp was generated by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated insertion of LCMV Clone-13 glycoprotein gene sequence into the genome of B16F10 cell line. Cells were selected in puromycin. All tumor cell lines were grown in complete DMEM-10 medium: DMEM (Gibco), 10% FBS (Gibco), 1% penicillin/ streptomycin (Gibco) and 1% L-glutamine (Gibco). For B16.Gp melanoma cells, additional 100U/ml puromycin is supplemented. T cell in vitro culture assays were performed with complete RPMI-1640 medium, supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol (Gibco) and 10 ng/ml recombinant human IL-2, otherwise indicated.
Six liver cancer patients (B1-B6) were enrolled and pathologically diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, the Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School. Prior to the procedure, patients were provided informed consent for the collection of research biopsies. Fresh tumor and tumor-draining lymph nodes (TdLN) were surgically obtained from the above-described patients, following the ethical regulations approved by the Research and Ethical Committee of Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital (The Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School). None of these patients had been diagnosed as hepatitis B, or was treated with chemotherapy or radiation before the tumor resection. The tumor stages of these patients were classified according to the guidance of Edmondson-Steiner grade. This project was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The available clinical information and metadata for the samples are summarized in Table S1 .
To set up mouse tumor cells, generally, the right flank of mice was shaved and half million of (0.5M) B16F10/B16.Gp cells (5 × 10 5 ), B16.OVA (5 × 10 5 ) or MC38 (5 × 10 5 ) were injected subcutaneously (s.c.). Tumors were measured every 2 days to estimate the tumor size in two dimensions with a caliper. The tumor volume was calculated according to the formula (length × width 2 )/2. Mice were sacrificed at the indicated time points or when the estimated tumor volume reached 2000 mm 3 (endpoint) and the weight of the excised tumor mass was determined.
Besides, to generate autochthonous lung tumors in a spatiotemporally controlled fashion, we utilized a model of lung adenocarcinoma driven by the conditional expression of oncogenic K-ras G12D in combination with the loss of p53. Briefly, Lung tumors were induced in K-ras LSL-G12D/+ -p53 fl/fl mice by intranasal inhalation of lentivirus expressing Cre recombinase as reported (hereafter called as K/P model) ( DuPage et al., 2009 22. DuPage, M. ∙ Dooley, A.L. ∙ Jacks, T. Conditional mouse lung cancer models using adenoviral or lentiviral delivery of Cre recombinase Nat. Protoc. 2009; 4 :1064-1072 Crossref Scopus (641) PubMed Google Scholar ). The lentiviral backbone Lenti-LucOS has been described previously ( DuPage et al., 2009 22. DuPage, M. ∙ Dooley, A.L. ∙ Jacks, T. Conditional mouse lung cancer models using adenoviral or lentiviral delivery of Cre recombinase Nat. Protoc. 2009; 4 :1064-1072 Crossref Scopus (641) PubMed Google Scholar ) and was purchased from Addgene (Plasmid#22777). Lentiviruses were produced by transfection of 293T cells with Lenti-LucOS, psPAX2 (gag/pol), and pMD2.G vectors at a 4:3:1 ratio ( DuPage et al., 2009 22. DuPage, M. ∙ Dooley, A.L. ∙ Jacks, T.

For tumor induction, 5 x10 6 TU of Lentivirus was intranasally administrated to one mouse between 10-12 weeks of age. Generally, the induced lung tumor could be histologically confirmed at 8 weeks post lentivirus infection.
The lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) Armstrong (Arm + ) and Clone 13 (Cl13) strains were kindly provided by Dr. R. Ahmed at Emory University and propagated in our lab. Mice were intraperitoneally infected (i.p) with 2 × 10 5 PFU (plaque-forming units) Armstrong or intravenously (i.v) with 2 × 10 6 PFU Cl13 virus( Wang et al., 2019 72. Wang, Y. ∙ Hu, J. ∙ Li, Y. ...

Attenuated Listeria. monocytogenes expressing LCMV glycoprotein 33-41 (Lm-Gp) was a gift from Dr. Xinyuan Zhou (Third Military Medical University) and was created by introducing an in-frame deletion in the actA gene as described ( Tvinnereim et al., 2002 69. Tvinnereim, A.R. ∙ Hamilton, S.E. ∙ Harty, J.T. CD8+-T-cell response to secreted and nonsecreted antigens delivered by recombinant Listeria monocytogenes during secondary infection Infect.

Constitutive activation of Wnt signaling favors generation of memory CD8 T cells J. Immunol. 2010; 184 :1191-1199 Crossref Scopus (140) PubMed Google Scholar ) (referred to as Lm-Gp). Bacteria were grown and quantified by optical density (OD) after overnight culture in brain heart infusion (BHI) media (1 OD refers to 8 × 10 8 CFU (colony-forming units)) as previously reported ( Chen et al., 2021 16. Chen, Z. ∙ Arai, E. ∙ Khan, O. ... In vivo CD8+ T cell CRISPR screening reveals control by Fli1 in infection and cancer Cell. 2021; 184 1262–1280.e22 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (103) Google Scholar ). All mouse experiments and breeding conditions were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of the Third Military Medical University.
For LCMV virus infection models, 5 × 10 4 (for acute viral infection) or 1000 (for chronic viral infection) CD45.1 + naïve splenic P14- Tcf7 -GFP cells were adoptively transferred into recipient mice with different congenic markers (CD45.2 + ) one day before infection.
For tumor models, tumor-bearing recipient mice were first intraperitoneally administrated with 4 mg cyclophosphamide (CTX, Sigma, PHR1404) at 6-8 days after tumor implantation when the tumor is palpable (about 3-5 mm in diameter), then 5 × 10 5 (otherwise indicated) naïve CD45.1 + splenic P14- Tcf7 -GFP cells were adoptively transferred into B16.Gp tumor-bearing mice. For B16.OVA tumor model, 1 × 10 5 naïve CD45.1 + splenic OT1- Tcf7 -GFP cells were adoptively transferred. For another strategy, naïve CD45.2 + recipient mice received CTX treatment firstly, then transferred with the same amounts of P14 or OT1 cells as above mentioned one day before tumor challenge. Otherwise indicated.
In experiments tracing cell proliferation patterns, P14 cells were labeled with proliferating-indicating dye (3 mM Celltrace Violet, 65-0842; eBioscience) according to the manufacturer’s guide before adoptively transferred into recipient mice.
For sorting T MEM P14 cells, CD45.1 + CD44 + GFP + CD8 T cells were generally sorted from the spleens of Armstrong infected mice at ≥Day 60. TdLN-P14 and TME-P14 cells were sorted as CD45.1 + CD44 + CD8 + GFP + and CD45.1 + CD44 + CD8 + PD1 + , respectively, from B16.Gp cell-inoculated mice on Day 15 post P14- Tcf7 -GFP cell transfer.
For sorting TdLN-T TSM , TdLN-T PEX , TME-T PEX and TME-T EX cells, B6 mice were first transferred with naïve CD45.1 + splenic P14- Tcf7 -GFP (5 × 10 5 ) or OT1- Tcf7 -GFP (1 × 10 5 ) cells and then inoculated with B16.Gp/B16.OVA tumor cells the next day. 15 days later, CD45.1 + CD44 + CD8 + GFP + PD1 lo TdLN-T TSM and CD45.1 + CD44 + CD8 + GFP + PD1 int TdLN-T PEX cells were sorted from the TdLNs of tumor-bearing mice. TME-T PEX and TME-T EX P14/OT1 cells were sorted as CD45.1 + CD44 + GFP(TCF1) + PD1 + Tim3 - and CD45.1 + CD44 + GFP(TCF1) - PD1 + Tim3 + CD8 + T cells, respectively, from tumor.
To assess tumor repressive capacity of CD8 + T cells from different compartments, 2 × 10 5 TdLN-T TSM /TdLN-T PEX /TME-T EX OT1 cells, or 2 × 10 6 TdLN derived bulk TdLN-T TSM (CD44 + GFP(TCF1) + PD1 lo CD8 + ) or TdLN-T PEX (CD44 + CD8 + GFP(TCF-1) + PD1 int ) cells were transferred into B16.OVA or B16.Gp tumor-bearing mice respectively.
To evaluate the long-term maintenance and homeostatic proliferation of antigen-specific CD8 + T cells, 1× 10 5 P14 cells from different origins were mixed at 1:1 ratio and co-transferred into naive B6 mice (2 × 10 5 P14 cells per mouse). And recipient mice were sacrificed at indicated timepoints to test the frequency and proliferation pattern of each population.
For recall experiments, 2 × 10 4 P14 cells from different origins were transferred into naive B6 recipients respectively, which were challenged with LCMV-Arm + or Lm-Gp and sacrificed at indicated timepoint to test the re-expansion of each population.
To evaluation the conversion between TdLN-T TSM and TdLN-T PEX cells, these two subsets were sorted from day 15 B16.Gp bearing mice and transferred separately into CD45.2 + tumor-bearing mice (2 × 10 4 /mouse). T TSM or TdLN-T PEX derived P14 progenies in TdLNs of recipient mice were assessed 8 days later. In ICB treatment, TdLN-T TSM and TdLN-T PEX cells (2 × 10 4 /mouse) were transferred to CD45.2 + B16.Gp tumor bearing mice, then anti-PD-L1 or control immunoglobulin were administrated intra-peritoneally at indicate time points. Then, TdLN-T TSM - and TdLN-T PEX - derived P14 cells in the TdLNs and TME were analyzed on Day 10 post cell transfer.
For immune-checkpoint blockade experiments, mice were intraperitoneally (i.p.) treated with 150 or 300 ( Figure S7 E) μg of anti-PD-L1 (10F.9G2, BioXCell), 150 μg of anti-CTLA4 (9H10, BioXCell) or control immunoglobulin (BioXCell, Rat IgG2b) at indicate time points. For intratumoral or intranodal administration of immune-checkpoint blockade, mice received 25 μg of anti-CTLA4 or anti-PD-L1 mAb administration in 20 μl of Pluronic F127 hydrogel (mixed thoroughly, working concentration: 20-25% (w/v)) ( Francis et al., 2020 26. Francis, D.M. ∙ Manspeaker, M.P. ∙ Schudel, A. ... Blockade of immune checkpoints in lymph nodes through locoregional delivery augments cancer immunotherapy Sci. Transl. Med. 2020; 12 :eaay3575 Crossref Scopus (145) PubMed Google Scholar ).
For this part, Cd8 -/- recipient mice were intravenously infected with 1 × 10 5 CFU (colony-forming unit) Lm-Gp one day post adoptive cell transfer. At Day 5 post infection, mice were sacrificed for calculating bacteria loads in tissues. Spleen and liver of infected mice were smashed in 1 ml BHI media with 70 μm cell strainer and 10-20 ul of the cell suspension were taken out for serial dilution in 96-wells round bottom plate. 1:10 2 , 1:10 3 , 1:10 4 , 1:10 5 , 1:10 6 , 1:10 7 and 1:10 8 dilution of the infected organ BHI media were made and plated on the BHI agarose (2%) plates. Colonies are counted after 12-16 hours incubation of the plates in a 37°C incubator.
Before surgical operations, mice were anesthetized with 8 mg/ml avertin (500 μl /mouse) to full muscle relaxation. For lymphadenectomy, the anesthetized mice were placed onto the sterilized surgery table and apply the drying preventive ointment on mouse eyes. Skin on lateral flanks was shaved and disinfected with alcohol prep pads. Small incisions were made on lateral flanks and both sides of inguinal lymph nodes were carefully removed. Then sew up the incision and disinfect skin around the cut with povidone-iodine swabs.
Tumor transplantation was conducted as we previously reported ( Wang et al., 2021 71. Wang, L. ∙ Wang, Z. ∙ Guo, J. ... Tumor transplantation for assessing the dynamics of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells in mice J. Vis. Exp. 2021; e62442 Google Scholar ). In brief, B16.Gp cells were inoculated into one side of the inguinal angel of B6 mice, and then P14 cells expressing different congenic markers (CD45.1 + CD45.2 + , CD45.1 + CD45.2 - or CD45.1 - CD45.2 + ) were transferred into tumor-bearing mice respectively. After 8 days (or 14 days, as indicated in related Figures), tumor (hereafter referred as donor) was surgically dissected from P14 cells transferred mice (an average of 5 mm 3 in size) and transplanted into tumor-matched recipients (with P14 in different congenic marker transferred) subcutaneously at the same flank of tumor inoculation. Then, P14 cells from donor and recipient were analyzed at indicated timepoints. In Figure 7 C, we sorted (CD45.1 + CD45.2 + ) TdLN-T TSM P14 cells and TdLN-T PEX P14 cells from day 12 B16.Gp tumor bearing mice, and transferred them with equal number to D8 B16.Gp tumor bearing recipients, respectively; subsequently, tumor mass from another D14 B16.Gp tumor bearing mice with P14 cells (CD45.1 + CD45.2 - ) adoptive transfer prior to tumor cell inoculation were transplanted to above mentioned recipient mice receiving either (CD45.1 + CD45.2 + ) TdLN-T TSM cells or TdLN-T PEX P14 cells; 2 days after tumor mass transplantation, recipient mice were treated with anti-PD-L1 antibodies and ratios of TdLN-T TSM or TdLN-T PEX derived P14 cells to donor derived P14 cells in TME were determined.
Splenocytes, lymph node cells, PBMC and TME cell (tumor microenvironment infiltrating lymphocytes) isolation were acquired as previously described ( Li et al., 2020 45. Li, Y. ∙ Wang, Z. ∙ Lin, H. ... Bcl6 preserves the suppressive function of regulatory T cells During tumorigenesis Front. Immunol. 2020; 11 :806 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, tumors were excised, manually dissociated. For MC38 model, tumor mass (or liver) was enzymatically digested with 1 mg/mL collagenase I and 0.02 mg/ml DNase I at 37°C. For K/P LUAD model, lung was first cut into tiny pieces with scissors and then enzymatically digested with 150 u/mL collagenase II (supplemented with 1mM MgCl 2 +1mM CaCl 2 ) and 0.02 mg/ml DNase I at 37°C. Digested tumors were then mashed through 70μm filters. Hematopoietic cells and lung lymphocytes were further purified using a discontinuous Percoll gradient (GE Healthcare). Cells at the interface were harvested and washed twice before further use. Suspensions of spleen and lymph node cells were obtained by mashing the spleen or lymph nodes through a 70μm nylon cell strainer (BD Falcon).
The antibodies and reagents used for flow cytometry staining are listed in key resources table . Surface staining was performed in PBS containing 2% BSA or FBS (w/v). For the detection of cytokine production and CCL5, lymphocytes were stimulated for 5 h in the presence of the indicated peptide (0.2 μg/ml of GP 33-41 or GP 276-284 , 0.4 μg/ml of KSPWFTIL), Golgi Plug, Golgi Stop, anti-CD107a and anti-CD107b antibodies (BD Biosciences). In B16.Gp, B16.OVA or OVA-expressing autochthonous tumor model (K/P), H-2D b GP 33-41 tetramer or H-2K b OVA-tetramer (SIINFEKL) were respectively used to detecting antigen-specific CD8 + T cells. Intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) for CD107a/b, IL-2, IFN-γ, TNF-α, granzyme B, CCL5, Bcl2 and Ki67 were performed with the Cytofix/Cytoperm Fixation/Permeabilization Kit (554714, BD Biosciences). Staining of Bcl2, TCF-1, T-bet, Eomes and TOX was performed with the Foxp3/Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Set (00-5523; eBioscience). Annexin V staining were performed with Annexin V Kit (88-8102-72; eBioscience) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. CellTrace Violet (C34557; Thermo Fisher) was stained according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To effectively block PD-1signaling in vitro , P14 cells were cultured in the presence of anti-PD-1(10 μg/ml), IL-2 (20 U/ml), anti-CD3 (2 μg/ml, 100302; Biolegend) and anti-CD28 (0.5 μg/ml, 102102; Biolegend) for 72 hours in a 37°C incubator (5% CO2). When necessary, cells were sorted on a BD FACSAria III (BD Biosciences) to obtain greater than 95% purity. In BrdU incorporation assay, mice were injected with a BrdU working solution at a dosage of 1.5 mg per mouse via intraperitoneal route daily prior to tissue harvest and analysis as previously reported ( Paley et al., 2012 54. Paley, M.A. ∙ Kroy, D.C. ∙ Odorizzi, P.M. ... Progenitor and terminal subsets of CD8+ T cells cooperate to contain chronic viral infection Science. 2012; 338 :1220-1225 Crossref Scopus (692) PubMed Google Scholar ). For experiment design shown in Figure S7 E, mice received only one dose of 3 mg BrdU. BrdU incorporation was assessed by the BrdU Flow Kit according to manufacturer’s instructions (BD Biosciences). Flow-cytometry data were acquired by FACSCanto II (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using FlowJo (Tree Star).
To validate the specificity of TCR clones to tumor antigens, paired α and β chains were annotated based on single-cell TCR sequencing data, and TCR sequences were selected from TdLN-derived top 6 expanded clones in Cluster 1 (see in Figure 5 A; Table S2 ). Construction of the TCRs was done by fusing the V–D-J of the Vβ regions to the mouse TCRβ constant chain, and the TCRα V-J regions to the mouse TCRα constant chains as previously reported ( Draper et al., 2015 20. Draper, L.M. ∙ Kwong, M.L. ∙ Gros, A. ... Targeting of HPV-16+ epithelial cancer cells by TCR gene engineered T cells directed against E6 Clin. Cancer Res. 2015; 21 :4431-4439 Crossref Scopus (145) PubMed Google Scholar ; Jin et al., 2018 34. Jin, B.Y. ∙ Campbell, T.E. ∙ Draper, L.M. ... Engineered T cells targeting E7 mediate regression of human papillomavirus cancers in a murine model JCI Insight. 2018; 3 :e99488 Crossref Scopus (116) PubMed Google Scholar ). The chains were separated by a furin-P2A linker ( Table S3 ). The chains were then synthesized and sub-cloned into the pHR_PGK lentiviral vector (Addgene).
Autologous PBMCs were plated at 1 × 10 6 cells/ml in 24-well plates in ImmunoCultTM-XF T Cell Expansion Medium (Stemcell Catalog #10981) supplemented with 20 ng/ul of HumanRecombinant IL-2 (Proleukin). T cells were activated with ImmunoCultTM Human CD3/CD28 T Cell Activator (Stemcell #10991) at a concentrate of 25 μL/mL. After 3 days of incubation at 37 °C and 5% CO2, CD3/CD28 T Cell Activator were removed through centrifugation and activated T cells were resuspend at cell density of 1 × 10 6 cells/mL by adding fresh complete ImmunoCultTM-XF T Cell Expansion Medium (containing 20ng/ml of IL-2).
For the generation of lentiviral supernatants, pHR_PGK encoding the TCRs (5 μg/well), the envelope-encoding plasmid pMD2.G (3 μg/well) and helper plasmid psPAX2 (5 μg/well) were co-transfected using Lipofectamine 3000 (Life Technologies) into the lentiviral packaging cell line HEK293T (1 × 10 6 cells per well of 10 cm poly-D-lysine–coated dishes, plated the day prior to transfection in the absence of antibiotics). Lentiviral supernatants were collected and concentrated at 48 hours after transfection as previously reported ( Kim et al., 2014 39. Kim, M. ∙ Hosmane, N.N. ∙ Bullen, C.K. ... A primary CD4(+) T cell model of HIV-1 latency established after activation through the T cell receptor and subsequent return to quiescence Nat. Protoc. 2014; 9 :2755-2770 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ).
For the transfection of TCRαβ pairs into T cells, the Lentivirus transduction system was used. Briefly, activated PBMC cells were seeded in 24-well plate with 1×10 6 cells/well and ‘spin-infected’ for 90 min at 37 °C by centrifugation (1000g) with lentivirus supernatants, together with 8 g/ml polybrene (H9268; Sigma-Aldrich). Transduced cells were further cultured for 3 days (37 °C and 5% CO2) and GFP + CD8 T cells (representing TCR ectopically expressed CD8 T cells) were sorted through FACS for further examination.
For the validation of antigen specificity, ELISpot assay was performed. Briefly, 2 × 10 4 TCR-transduced T cells were first serially diluted (3 fold); then co-cultured with poly(I:C)-treated autologous tumor cells were (at a ratio of 2:1) in pre-coated 96-well IFN-γ ELISpot plates (Mabtech). After 20h of incubation, cells were harvested from ELISpot plates to assess 4-1BB expression, and plates were developed according to the manufacturer’s instructions and counted with a ChampSpot EliSpot Analysis System.
The following mouse T cells were sorted for single-cell RNA-seq: live/dead-CD8 + CD44 + GFP + CD45.1 + P14 cells from spleens of Day 200 LCMV Arm-infected mice; live/dead - CD8 + CD44 + CD45.1 + P14 cells from dLNs and PBMC of B16.Gp tumor-bearing mice on Day 16 post P14 cell transfer. TME-derived live/dead - CD8 + CD44 + PD1 + CD45.1 + P14 cells (Day 16 post P14 cell transfer) were also included (GEO: GSE152628 ). The scRNA-seq libraries were generated using Chromium Single Cell 3′ Library & Gel Bead Kit v.2 (10x Genomics) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, 1–1.5 × 10 4 FACS-sorted live cells were used to generate single-cell gel-beads in emulsion for a target recovery of 6,000 single cells. After reverse transcription, gel-beads in emulsion were disrupted. Barcoded complementary DNA was isolated and amplified by PCR (12 cycles). Following fragmentation, end repair and A-tailing, sample indexes were added during index PCR (8 cycles). The purified libraries were sequenced on a NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina) with 26 cycles of read 1, 8 cycles of i7 index and 98 cycles of read 2. Total RNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCR assay are conducted as previously reported ( Wang et al., 2019 72. Wang, Y. ∙ Hu, J. ∙ Li, Y. ... The transcription factor TCF1 preserves the effector function of exhausted CD8 T cells during chronic viral infection Front. Immunol. 2019; 10 :169 Crossref Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The following cells were sorted for ATAC-seq: live/dead - CD8 + CD44 + GFP + CD45.1 + P14 cells from TdLNs at Day 4, 8 and Day 21 B16.Gp tumors, TdLN-T TSM (CD45.1 + CD44 + GFP + PD1 lo ) and TdLN-T PEX (CD45.1 + CD44 + GFP + PD1 int ) P14 cells from TdLN of Day 23 B16.Gp tumor bearing mice with P14 transferred one day prior to tumor inoculation. The ATAC-Seq libraries were prepared as previously described ( Chen et al., 2019 15. Chen, X. ∙ Cao, G. ∙ Wu, J. ... The histone methyltransferase EZH2 primes the early differentiation of follicular helper T cells during acute viral infection Cell. Mol. Immunol. 2019; 17 :247-260 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, 50,000 target cells were washed with PBS and then treated with lysis buffer, followed by labeling with the Nextera enzyme (15027865; Illumina). The labeled samples were immediately amplified by 9–10 cycles of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with barcoded primers and sequenced with a NovaSeq 6000 instrument in a 150 bp/150 bp paired-end run or a NextSeq500 instrument in a 76 bp/76 bp paired-end run.
Single-cell suspensions from collected biopsies were obtained using a modified version of a previously published protocol ( Woo et al., 2001 74. Woo, E.Y. ∙ Chu, C.S. ∙ Goletz, T.J. ... Regulatory CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells in tumors from patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer and late-stage ovarian cancer Cancer Res. 2001; 61 :4766-4772 PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, the fresh biopsies were processed by sterile mechanical dissection and stirred 1-2 hours at 37 °C shaker (50 rpm) in an enzymatic bath containing RPMI-1640 supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin (50 IU/ml–50 mg/ml; Mediatech), collagenase type I (1 mg/ml; Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO), DNase type IV (30 units/ml; Sigma Chemical Co.), and hyaluronidase type V (0.01% (v/v); Sigma Chemical Co.). Digested tissues were filtered through 70 μm strainer to achieve single cell suspension, which was proceeded to 44%-67% discontinuous Percoll gradient (GE Healthcare) centrifuge to enrich lymphocytes at the interface. Lymphocytes were harvested and washed twice in PBS-2% FBS (v/v) before frozen in FBS supplemented with 10% DMSO (Sigma) (v/v) at -80 °C for overnight and then in liquid nitrogen until further usage.
To isolate the tumor specific CD8 + T cells, the single cell lymphocyte suspensions from the tumors and tumor draining lymph nodes of the five patients were thawed and cultured for 3 hours at 37 °C in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% human serum (human AB serum, Gemini Bioproducts). The lymphocyte cells were then stained in PBS-0.5% BSA (w/v) with live/dead (L/D)-APC/CY7, CD45RA-PB, PD1-PE, CD8-PE-CY7, CCR7-PERCP and CD39-FITC (for tumor cells) before subjected to FACS. Due to the limitation of cell numbers obtained from tumor tissues and the low level of live cell ratio, tumor and lymph node lymphocyte cells from two and three patients were mixed, respectively, for cell sorting. L/D - CD45RA - CCR7 + PD-1 dim CD8 + T cells from TdLN and L/D - CD45RA - CD39 + PD1 + CD8 + T cells from tumor (TME) were collected, respectively, in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% human BSA in 15 mL tubes. According to the sorter records, ∼7,500 to 6.3 × 10 5 cells were collected from TdLNs and ∼ 3,600 to 5.8 × 10 5 were enriched from tumor samples. The information of the patients was listed in Table S1 .
The 5’ single cell RNA-seq and immune profiling libraries were generated using Chromium Single Cell 5′ Library & Gel Bead Kit v. 1 or v. 2 (10x Genomics) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, after the above-mentioned patient CD8 + cells were sorted into RPMI-1640 medium in 15 mL tubes, the tubes were centrifuged with flying rotor at 450 g at room temperature (RT) for 8 min. The supernatant was carefully removed with pipette and ∼30 μL residue media with cells were left undisturbed in the tube bottom. Then, the cells in the residue were gently and thoroughly mixed and were kept on ice until ready for single-cell library construction. Cells from the four samples (≤16,500 cells per sample) were loaded separately into 10x Chromium Next GEM Chip K to prepare single cell emulsion according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The reverse transcription and cDNA amplification were performed according to the manufacturer’s manual. Size distribution and DNA concentration of amplified cDNA were measured with Qsep (BiOptic) and Qubit HS dsDNA kit (Thermofisher), respectively. Aliquots of cDNA from each sample were proceeded to construction of expression libraries and TCR libraries according to the manufacturer’s manual. All libraries were sequenced with Illumina Novaseq under the 2 × 150 bp model, obtaining ∼58,000 reads/cell and ∼24,000 reads/cell for each expression library and TCR library, respectively.
Raw 3’ and 5’ single-cell RNA data from this project and published datasets (listed in key resources table ) were processed using 10X Genomics Cell Ranger Suite (v3.1.0), including aligning the demultiplexed FASTQ reads to the reference genome (mm10, v3.0.0 for mouse data; GRCh38 for patient data, from 10X Genomics) and counting the unique molecular identifier (UMI) for each cell barcode by using the ‘cellranger count’ function. For each sample, data sets from individual libraries were aggregated using the ‘cellranger aggr’ function of Cell Ranger Suite without sequencing depth normalization. Accordingly, a gene expression matrix for digital cells was generated, containing the number of UMI for each gene detected in each cell. The raw gene expression matrix was filtered using the following criteria. First, we removed cells with over 20% of mitochondrial gene expression in UMI counts because dead and damaged cells often exhibit extensive mitochondrial contamination ( Ilicic et al., 2016 31. Ilicic, T. ∙ Kim, J.K. ∙ Kolodziejczyk, A.A. ... Classification of low quality cells from single-cell RNA-seq data Genome Biol. 2016; 17 :29 Crossref Scopus (411) PubMed Google Scholar ). Second, we removed cells for which less than 200 genes were detected. The number of retained cells for each sample was summarized in Figure S2 A. In the end, we obtained a total of 28,958 mouse and 40,847 patient, respectively, single cells for further analysis.
The processed gene expression matrix with all retained cells for each sample was imported to the Seurat R package (v3.2.3) for downstream analyses ( Stuart et al., 2019 65. Stuart, T. ∙ Butler, A. ∙ Hoffman, P. ... Comprehensive integration of single-cell data Cell. 2019; 177 1888–1902.e21 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (7323) PubMed Google Scholar ). The mitochondrial genes were ruled out from the gene expression matrix in each sample, and then the matrix was normalized using the ‘NormalizeData’ function, in which UMI counts for each gene were divided by the total UMI counts in each cell and multiplied by the scale factor of 1000, following by natural-log transformation with adding a pseudo count of 1 for each gene. Based on the normalized expression matrix, 2,000 most variable genes were identified for each sample using the ‘FindVariableFeatures’ function with the ‘vst’ method. To avoid the dominant effect of Ribosomal protein-coding genes, which usually show very abundant expression levels in subpopulation of cells, those Ribosomal protein coding genes were removed from the list of the variable genes. The remained variable genes from each sample were combined to obtain a unique list for the high variable genes (7,071) in the set of gene expression matrixes. The unique list for the high variable genes was applied for the next principal component analysis (PCA). Before PCA, the gene expression matrixes from each sample were merged into a whole gene expression matrix for all cells, and the ‘ScaleData’ function was then used to scale and center the gene expression matrix after regressing out the heterogeneity associated with the mitochondrial contamination. PCA was performed on the selected variable genes to identify the top 50 principal components using the ‘RunPCA’ function of Seurat. Substantial variability between cells has been obtained from different samples, reflecting a combination of technical and biological variations. These batch effects in some cases may lead to cluster cells first by sample heterogeneity, rather than cell types or cell states. To eliminate the batch effects, we used the Harmony (v1.0)( Korsunsky et al., 2019 40. Korsunsky, I. ∙ Millard, N. ∙ Fan, J. ... Fast, sensitive and accurate integration of single-cell data with harmony Nat. Methods. 2019; 16 :1289-1296 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) to integrate seven datasets into a shared space for unsupervised clustering. Briefly, we fed the calculated PCA matrix into the ‘RunHarmony’ function implemented in Seurat. As the Harmony algorithm can integrate categorical covariates, we set sample and 10X library construction protocol (Chromium Single Cell 3’ Reagent Kit v2 and v3) as two covariates for batch effect correction. For those two covariates, the corresponding theta parameters were set as 2 and 1.2, respectively. The batch-effect-corrected Harmony embeddings were then applied to dimension reduction using the ‘RunUMAP’ function in Seurat. After the Harmony integration, Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) ( Becht et al., 2018 7. Becht, E. ∙ McInnes, L. ∙ Healy, J. ... Dimensionality reduction for visualizing single-cell data using UMAP Nat. Biotechnol. 2018; Crossref Scopus (2577) PubMed Google Scholar ) visualization indicated cells from different samples were well mixed into the shared space. To perform the clustering analysis, we applied Harmony reduction as input for building the Shared Nearest Neighbor (SNN) graph using Principal components (PCs) 1 to 50 and k =25 nearest neighbors, and then the Louvain clustering algorithm was used to group the cells into different clusters. These parameters were chosen for SNN graph construction to ensure cells from distinct compartments were not grouped.
Differentially expressed genes in different clusters were identified by the ‘FindAllMarkers’ function in Seurat using the ‘MAST’ test and setting min.pct=0.25. MAST algorithm fits a hurdle model to the expression of each gene, consisting of logistic regression for the zero values (the undetectable expression level) and linear regression for the non-zero values (the expression level) ( Finak et al., 2015 24. Finak, G. ∙ McDavid, A. ∙ Yajima, M. ... MAST: a flexible statistical framework for assessing transcriptional changes and characterizing heterogeneity in single-cell RNA sequencing data Genome Biol. 2015; 16 :278 Crossref Scopus (1482) PubMed Google Scholar ). The cell subset representing cell cycle states (cluster 7 in Figure 3 A) was excluded for identifying differentially expressed genes. The UMAP was applied to visualize the transcriptional profiles of the differentially expressed genes in 2D space based on the SNN graph described above ( Figures 3 E and S2 D). Other dot plots and heatmaps for the differentially expressed genes were generated by customized R code using ggplot2 (v3.3.3, R package).
We applied two complementary methods to annotate the characteristics of different cell clusters in Figure 3 A. We first checked whether the well-characterized marker genes of different T cells were in the top rank of differentially expressed genes of query clusters and then assigned the most likely identity to the query cluster. If the query cluster without the support of signature genes, we then applied the SingleR ( Aran et al., 2019 6. Aran, D. ∙ Looney, A.P. ∙ Liu, L. ... Reference-based analysis of lung single-cell sequencing reveals a transitional profibrotic macrophage Nat. Immunol. 2019; 20 :163-172 Crossref Scopus (1976) PubMed Google Scholar ), which leverages reference transcriptomic datasets of known cell types for annotation, to determine whether the predicted annotation for a query cluster based on different reference datasets were consistent, and then assigned that query cluster as the predicted cell-type annotation. Alternatively, we annotated a query cluster with genes in the top rank of differentially expressed gene list of the query cluster.
Antigen specific TdLN-CD8 + T cells were largely grouped into two subsets, T MEM 1 ( Ilr7 + Sell7 + ) and T MEM 2 ( Tcf7 + Cd69 + ) clusters, during the unsupervised clustering as described above. To systematically characterize the transcriptional differences between TdLN CD8 + T cells and memory CD8 + T cells, we extracted the annotated T MEM 1 ( Ilr7 + Sell7 + ) and T MEM 2 ( Tcf7 + Cd69 + ) subsets from TdLN and Arm-D200 (memory T cells) datasets for re-clustering analysis. The selected subpopulations of cells then were applied with the pipeline as described above for re-clustering, with the modification that the SNN graph defined using PCs 1 to 30 and k =50 nearest neighbors. These parameters allowed to yield relatively fewer subclusters, enabling the detection of the major differences between the two subclusters ( Figure 3 F). We then searched for differentially expressed genes that could accurately distinguish between cells in each subcluster versus all other cells using ‘FindAllMarkers’ function in Seurat with parameters described above. Sub-clusters containing significantly discriminative marker genes were flagged for further analyses ( Figure S2 H). We found that over 160 genes were differentially expressed between Subclusters 1 and 2 ( Figures S2 H and S2I). Because well-studied marker genes are inadequate to characterize the sub-clusters, we used the top discriminative marker genes to annotate the identity of the sub-clusters ( Figures 3 H and S2 K–S2O).
In order to evaluate whether a hallmark or critical gene set was enriched within the expressed genes for each cell, we calculated a gene set activity score for each gene set using an Area Under the Curve (AUC) method named AUCell (v1.7.2, R package) ( Aibar et al., 2017 3. Aibar, S. ∙ González-Blas, C.B. ∙ Moerman, T. ... SCENIC: single-cell regulatory network inference and clustering Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :1083-1086 Crossref Scopus (2533) PubMed Google Scholar ). A collection of annotated gene sets was downloaded from the MSigDB database (v7.1). For each query gene set, we built the AUC of recovery curve for each cell based on the ranking of the top 5,000 genes in every single cell. In the recovery curve, the x-axis represents the ranking of expressed genes from high to low based on their expression values, and the y-axis is the number of genes recovered from the query gene set. We used the ‘AUCell_calcAUC’ function to calculate an AUC score for each query gene set in each cell. Each cell can be colored based on their AUC scores with UMAP embedding for visualization. The distribution of AUC scores across all cells allows exploring the relative expression of signatures in cell subpopulations ( Figures S2 E and S2J).
Raw CD8 + T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing data were processed using the ‘multi’ function in the 10X Genomics Cell Ranger Suite (v5.0.0). The sequencing reads from each TCR sequencing library were aligned to human GRCh38 V(D)J reference genome (v5.0.0, from 10X Genomics), resulting in the assembly of V(D)J sequences and CD8 + clonotypes. On average, approximately 24,000 read pairs were obtained for each cell in the 12 TCR sequencing libraries (6 from TdLNs and the other 6 from TME). We used the default settings in the ‘multi’ function to discard cells with low-confidence or non-detectable TCR contigs. The assembled TCR contigs from all TCR libraries were combined to identify clonal TCRs and clonal CD8 + T cells shared between TdLN and TME. For cells with two or more TRA (TCRα) or TRB (TCRβ) chains assembled, the TRA–TRB pair showing the highest UMI count was defined as the dominant TRA–TRB pair in the corresponding cell. If two or more cells had identical dominant TRA–TRB pairs, the dominant TRA-TRB pair were identified as clonal TCRs, and these T cells were identified as clonal CD8 + T cells. In order to characterize the cell states of clonal CD8 + T cells shared between TdLN and TME, we required the clonal CD8 + T cells to be detected at least twice in TIL. According to the criteria described above, we recovered 1165 and 2211 clonal CD8 + T cells from TdLN and TME, respectively, representing 209 clonal TCRs ( Figure 5 A). The detailed TRA and TRB sequences and clone counts are shown in Table S2 . Those recovered clonal CD8 + T cells were integrated with their matched scRNA-seq data to perform the unsupervised clustering and identify differentially expressed genes as previously described.
We used TraCeR to reconstruct human TCR sequences from scRNA-seq data with minor modification ( Stubbington et al., 2016 66. Stubbington, M.J.T. ∙ Lönnberg, T. ∙ Proserpio, V. ... T cell fate and clonality inference from single-cell transcriptomes Nat. Methods. 2016; 13 :329-332 Crossref Scopus (320) PubMed Google Scholar ). The V gene in each TCR sequence was identified by V-QUEST tool in IMGT database ( Brochet et al., 2008 9. Brochet, X. ∙ Lefranc, M.P. ∙ Giudicelli, V. IMGT/V-QUEST: the highly customized and integrated system for IG and TR standardized V-J and V-D-J sequence analysis Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36 :W503-W508 Crossref Scopus (929) PubMed Google Scholar ). The human TCR constant regions were exchanged for mouse TCR constant regions to reduce mispairing with endogenous TCR chains as previously reported ( Cohen et al., 2006 17. Cohen, C.J. ∙ Zhao, Y. ∙ Zheng, Z. ... Enhanced antitumor activity of murine-human hybrid T-cell receptor (TCR) in human lymphocytes is associated with improved pairing and TCR/CD3 stability Cancer Res. 2006; 66 :8878-8886 Crossref Scopus (366) PubMed Google Scholar ; Jin et al., 2018 34. Jin, B.Y. ∙ Campbell, T.E. ∙ Draper, L.M. ... Engineered T cells targeting E7 mediate regression of human papillomavirus cancers in a murine model JCI Insight. 2018; 3 :e99488 Crossref Scopus (116) PubMed Google Scholar ; Xiong et al., 2020 77. Xiong, Q. ∙ Peng, C. ∙ Yan, X. ... Characteristics of SARS-CoV-2-specific cytotoxic T cells revealed by single-cell immune profiling of longitudinal COVID-19 blood samples Signal Transduct. Target. Ther. 2020; 5 :285 Crossref Scopus (7) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We constructed cell trajectories with Monocle 3 using scRNA-seq data ( Cao et al., 2019 11. Cao, J. ∙ Spielmann, M. ∙ Qiu, X. ... The single-cell transcriptional landscape of mammalian organogenesis Nature. 2019; 566 :496-502 Crossref Scopus (1791) PubMed Google Scholar ). The dimensionality of the scRNA-seq data was reduced by PCA with 50 components and UMAP was applied to visualize the result of data dimensionality reduction. We chose the cell derived from TdLN and with the highest expression level of TCF7 as the ‘root’ of the trajectory. Monocle 3 ordered each cell along a learned trajectory according to its transcriptional progress. The default parameters in Monocle 3 were used for the analysis.
Bulk ATAC-seq sequencing reads downloaded from the Sequence Read Archive from the study of Jadhav et al. ( Jadhav et al., 2019 33. Jadhav, R.R. ∙ Im, S.J. ∙ Hu, B. ... Epigenetic signature of PD-1+ TCF1+ CD8 T cells that act as resource cells during chronic viral infection and respond to PD-1 blockade Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2019; 116 :14113-14118 Crossref Scopus (149) PubMed Google Scholar ) (GEO: PRJNA546023) were aligned to the mouse reference genome (mm10) using ‘mem’ function in bwa (v0.7.15) ( Li and Durbin, 2009 44. Li, H. ∙ Durbin, R. Fast and accurate short read alignment with Burrows-Wheeler transform Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :1754-1760 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mapped reads were filtered for mapping quality (-q 20), and duplicates were removed using the MarkDuplicates tool in Picard (v1.107). Reads aligned to scaffolds and chrM or chrY were excluded for downstream analyses. Biological replicates were combined to call peaks using MACS2 ( Zhang et al., 2008 81. Zhang, Y. ∙ Liu, T. ∙ Meyer, C.A. ... Model-based analysis of ChIP-Seq (MACS) Genome Biol. 2008; 9 :R137 Crossref Scopus (10894) PubMed Google Scholar ) with parameters --call-summits --nomodel --shift -100 --extsize 200 –keep-dup all. Resulting peaks from different cell types were pooled, and overlapping peaks were merged using the ‘merge’ function in bedtools (v2.25.0) ( Quinlan and Hall, 2010 56. Quinlan, A.R. ∙ Hall, I.M. BEDTools: a flexible suite of utilities for comparing genomic features Bioinformatics. 2010; 26 :841-842 Crossref Scopus (15109) PubMed Google Scholar ). This approach yielded a total of 59,992 merged peaks in the analyses relative to Figure S3 . We then counted sequencing reads in each merged peak from each dataset to generate a count matrix and the matrix was applied for PCA analysis in Figure S3 A. In order to profile the state-specific epigenetic landscape of TdLN CD8 + T cells in Figure S3 , we applied DEseq2 (v1.30.1) to identify differential chromatin accessibility regions between TdLN CD8 + T cells and other types of CD8 + T cells, including stem-like exhausted CD8 + T cells, terminal exhausted CD8 + T cells, terminal effector CD8 + T cells, memory CD8 + T cells and memory precursor CD8 + T cells. Totally, we identified 6,316 chromatin accessibility regions showing significant differences (|log 2 (FC)|>2.5, FDR<0.01) between TdLN CD8 + T cells and other CD8 + T cells. Read counts were generated for each differential chromatin accessibility region, normalized with DEseq2 (v1.0.3, R package) ( Love et al., 2014 46. Love, M.I. ∙ Huber, W. ∙ Anders, S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2 Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :550 Crossref Scopus (48467) PubMed Google Scholar ), and clustered into six distinct groups using the Self-Organizing Map algorithm (SOM, v0.3, R package) ( Chaudhary et al., 2014 14. Chaudhary, V. ∙ Bhatia, R.S. ∙ Ahlawat, A.K. A novel self-organizing map (SOM) learning algorithm with nearest and farthest neurons Alex. Eng. J. 2014; 53 :827-831 Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar ). Differential chromatin accessibility regions were centered by their summits with 2 kb extension at both sides to visualize the enrichment of ATAC-seq signals in details ( Figure S3 B).
To characterize the epigenetic landscape of TdLN-T TSM , TdLN-T PEX , and Cl13-T PEX , bulk ATAC-seq data from the three samples were analyzed similar as above. We obtained 44,484 merged peaks for the PCA analysis in Figure S4 C and 12,746 significantly differential chromatin accessible regions (|log 2 (FC)|>1, FDR<0.01) between each two samples.
Many ATAC-seq peaks locate at non-coding genomic regions, which are not overlapping with transcription start sites of genes and typically lack functional annotations. GREAT is broadly used to assign biological meaning to a set of non-coding genomic regions by analyzing the annotations of their nearby genes( McLean et al., 2010 51. McLean, C.Y. ∙ Bristor, D. ∙ Hiller, M. ... GREAT improves functional interpretation of cis-regulatory regions Nat. Biotechnol. 2010; 28 :495-501 Crossref Scopus (2963) PubMed Google Scholar ). We obtained the genomic coordinates of differential chromatin accessibility peaks from each cluster in Figures S3 B and S4 D, and then performed enrichment for gene ontology terms using the GREAT online tool ( http://great.stanford.edu/public/html/ ). The P-value cutoff of 0.01 after multiple hypothesis correction using the Benjamini-Hochberg method was applied to select the significantly enriched gene ontology terms in each cluster in Figures S3 B and S4 D, respectively ( Figures S3 C and S4 E).
Genomic regions surrounding ATAC-seq peaks typically are enriched for binding sites of transcription factors (TFs). We applied the MEME-ChIP tool in MEME Suite ( Machanick and Bailey, 2011 47. Machanick, P. ∙ Bailey, T.L. MEME-ChIP: motif analysis of large DNA datasets Bioinformatics. 2011; 27 :1696-1697 Crossref Scopus (1195) PubMed Google Scholar ) to comprehensively determine which TF binding motifs were most centrally enriched at the ATAC-seq peaks from each cluster in Figures S3 B and S4 D. we extracted 250 bp DNA sequences centered by ATAC-seq peak summits and fed them to MEME-ChIP online tool ( https://meme-suite.org/meme/tools/meme-chip ). The ‘JASPAR CORE (2014)’ motif database was used for scanning binding motifs of TFs both from human and mouse. The E-value indicating significant enrichment was applied to generate motif enrichment heatmap in Figures S3 D and S4 F.
Statistical analysis was performed with Prism 7.0 (GraphPad) by two-tailed paired Student’s t-test, two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test, or one-way ANOVA with Newman–Keuls’s test. Two-way ANOVA was performed for comparing tumor growth curves. The log-rank (Mantel–Cox) test was performed for comparing mouse survival curves. n represents the number of mice used in the experiment, with the number of individual experiments listed in the legend. Graphs show individual samples and center values indicate mean. p values < 0.05 were considered significant ( ∗ : p < 0.05; ∗∗ : p < 0.01; ∗∗∗ : p < 0.001); ns: not significant, p-values > 0.05).
