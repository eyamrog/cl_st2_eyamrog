Title: Secreted gelsolin inhibits DNGR-1-dependent cross-presentation and cancer immunity


Abstract: Summary

Cross-presentation of antigens from dead tumor cells by type 1 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1s) is thought to underlie priming of anti-cancer CD8 + T cells. cDC1 express high levels of DNGR-1 (a.k.a. CLEC9A), a receptor that binds to F-actin exposed by dead cell debris and promotes cross-presentation of associated antigens. Here, we show that secreted gelsolin (sGSN), an extracellular protein, decreases DNGR-1 binding to F-actin and cross-presentation of dead cell-associated antigens by cDC1s. Mice deficient in sGsn display increased DNGR-1-dependent resistance to transplantable tumors, especially ones expressing neoantigens associated with the actin cytoskeleton, and exhibit greater responsiveness to cancer immunotherapy. In human cancers, lower levels of intratumoral sGSN transcripts, as well as presence of mutations in proteins associated with the actin cytoskeleton, are associated with signatures of anti-cancer immunity and increased patient survival. Our results reveal a natural barrier to cross-presentation of cancer antigens that dampens anti-tumor CD8 + T cell responses.

Section: Introduction

Type 1 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1s) are indispensable for effective anti-tumor immunity ( Wculek et al., 2020 67. Wculek, S.K. ∙ Cueto, F.J. ∙ Mujal, A.M. ... Dendritic cells in cancer immunology and immunotherapy Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2020; 20 :7-24 Crossref Scopus (1499) PubMed Google Scholar ). In mouse pre-clinical models, absence of cDC1s prevents CD8 + T cell-driven regression of immunogenic tumors and curtails therapeutic responses to adoptive T cell transfer or checkpoint blockade inhibition ( Broz et al., 2014 9.

In human cancers, cDC1 abundance correlates with CD8 + T cell infiltration and increased overall patient survival, as well as with clinical responses to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy ( Barry et al., 2018 6.

Conversely, strategies to increase the recruitment, survival, expansion, and functionality of cDC1s in the TME enhance tumor immune control and show promise as immunotherapies ( Böttcher et al., 2018 8.

The key role of cDC1s in anti-tumor immunity is in part attributed to their ability to transport tumor antigens to draining lymph nodes and prime cancer-specific CD8 + T cells ( Alloatti et al., 2017 2.

WDFY4 is required for cross-presentation in response to viral and tumor antigens Science. 2018; 362 :694-699 Crossref Scopus (202) PubMed Google Scholar ). This requires the acquisition of those antigens from tumor cells and their subsequent presentation by MHC class I molecules, a process termed cross-presentation. However, the mechanisms by which cDC1s acquire tumor antigens for cross-presentation remain unclear, and it is not known whether interference with this process can constitute a means of cancer immune evasion.
A possible source of tumor antigens for cross-presentation is necrotic cell debris ( Galluzzi et al., 2017 19. Galluzzi, L. ∙ Buqué, A. ∙ Kepp, O. ...

Dying cells actively regulate adaptive immune responses Nat. Rev.

Cross-presentation of cell-associated antigens by CD8alpha+ dendritic cells is attributable to their ability to internalize dead cells Immunology. 2002; 107 :183-189 Crossref Scopus (177) PubMed Google Scholar ). cDC1 express high levels of the C-type lectin receptor DNGR-1 (a.k.a. CLEC9A), which binds to F-actin exposed on necrotic cell corpses ( Hanč et al., 2016a 23. Hanč, P. ∙ Iborra, S. ∙ Zelenay, S. ...

Canton, J. ∙ Blees, H. ∙ Henry, C.M. ... The receptor DNGR-1 signals for phagosomal rupture to promote cross-presentation of dead-cell-associated antigens Nat. Immunol. 2021; 22 :140-153 Crossref Scopus (100) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, DNGR-1 signaling in ligand-containing phagosomes promotes phagosomal membrane rupture and release of antigenic material into the cytosol of cDC1s, where it can enter the endogenous MHC class I presentation pathway ( Canton et al., 2021 11. Canton, J. ∙ Blees, H. ∙ Henry, C.M. ... The receptor DNGR-1 signals for phagosomal rupture to promote cross-presentation of dead-cell-associated antigens Nat. Immunol. 2021; 22 :140-153 Crossref Scopus (100) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistent with that finding, DNGR-1 contributes to effective CD8 + T cell responses to several cytopathic viruses and to allografts ( Balam et al., 2020 5. Balam, S. ∙ Kesselring, R. ∙ Elke, E. ...

Invest. 2012; 122 :1615-1627 Crossref Scopus (212) PubMed Google Scholar ). Interestingly, high CLEC9A expression in the TME associates with favorable prognosis in human cancer ( Böttcher et al., 2018 8. Böttcher, J.P. ∙ Bonavita, E. ∙ Chakravarty, P. ... NK Cells Stimulate Recruitment of cDC1 into the Tumor Microenvironment Promoting Cancer Immune Control Cell. 2018; 172 :1022-1037.e14 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1173) PubMed Google Scholar ) but whether DNGR-1 plays a role in anti-tumor immunity and if it can be subverted for immune escape is not known.
Serum and plasma of all mammals contain two abundant actin-binding proteins (ABPs), secreted gelsolin (sGSN) and Gc globulin, that are thought to contribute to the removal of potentially pathological actin filaments released from or exposed by necrotic cells following tissue damage ( Hartwig and Kwiatkowski, 1991 25.

In this so-called plasma actin-scavenging system, sGSN binds to F-actin in a Ca 2+ -dependent manner and severs the filaments for subsequent depolymerization, which is facilitated by Ca 2+ -independent sequestering of monomeric G-actin by Gc ( Haddad et al., 1990 21.

All cells make cytoplasmic GSN, which is an important intracellular regulator of actin filament dynamics ( Kwiatkowski, 1999 32. Kwiatkowski, D.J.

Cells can additionally produce and secrete sGSN ( Kwiatkowski et al., 1988b 35. Kwiatkowski, D.J. ∙ Mehl, R. ∙ Izumo, S. ... Muscle is the major source of plasma gelsolin J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263 :8239-8243 Abstract Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ) by making use of an alternatively spliced exon in the GSN gene that encodes a signal peptide ( Kwiatkowski et al., 1988a 34.

It is reported that human cancer cells can secrete large amounts of sGSN, leading to extracellular concentrations in the TME of up to 400 μg/mL ( Asare-Werehene et al., 2020 4.

Here, we report that sGSN blocks DNGR-1 ligand binding and that mice selectively lacking sGSN display DNGR-1- and CD8 + T cell-dependent control of several transplantable tumors, especially ones expressing neoantigens associated with actin cytoskeleton. In cancer patients, lower expression of sGSN in the TME correlates with patient survival, especially in subcohorts of patients with increased CLEC9A intratumoral expression and prevalence of mutations in proteins associated with actin cytoskeleton. Collectively, our data identify sGSN as an endogenous factor that contributes to cancer immune evasion by dampening DNGR-1-dependent cross-presentation of dead cell-associated antigens by cDC1.

DNGR-1 triggering by F-actin is potentiated by ABPs such as myosin II ( Schulz et al., 2018 57. Schulz, O. ∙ Hanč, P. ∙ Böttcher, J.P. ... Myosin II Synergizes with F-Actin to Promote DNGR-1-Dependent Cross-Presentation of Dead Cell-Associated Antigens Cell Rep. 2018; 24 :419-428 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ). We wondered whether other ABPs might act instead as inhibitors of DNGR-1. We noticed that fetal calf serum (FCS), used instead of milk powder as a blocking reagent in a dot blot ( Ahrens et al., 2012 1. Ahrens, S. ∙ Zelenay, S. ∙ Sancho, D. ... F-actin is an evolutionarily conserved damage-associated molecular pattern recognized by DNGR-1, a receptor for dead cells Immunity. 2012; 36 :635-645 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (322) PubMed Google Scholar ), inhibited binding of the extracellular domain of DNGR-1 (DNGR-1 ECD) to immobilized F-actin in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 1 A). To assess if this involved actin-binding molecules present in FCS, we mixed the serum with F-actin and discarded the latter, together with any bound material, by high-speed centrifugation. FCS treated in this manner failed to inhibit DNGR-1 binding to immobilized F-actin ( Figure 1 B). Consistent with the serum factor in question being sGSN, treatment of membrane-immobilized F-actin with human recombinant sGSN completely abolished DNGR-1 binding, while treatment with cofilin, a cellular ABP that also destabilizes actin filaments ( Carlier et al., 1999 13. Carlier, M.F. ∙ Ressad, F. ∙ Pantaloni, D. Control of actin dynamics in cell motility. Role of ADF/cofilin J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274 :33827-33830 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (178) PubMed Google Scholar ; Moon and Drubin, 1995 46. Moon, A. ∙ Drubin, D.G. The ADF/cofilin proteins: stimulus-responsive modulators of actin dynamics Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6 :1423-1431 Crossref Scopus (229) PubMed Google Scholar ) had no effect ( Figure 1 C). To more quantitatively measure gelsolin interference with DNGR-1 binding, we switched to flow cytometric analysis of bead-bound, fluorescent F-actin. Recapitulating the dot blot findings, binding of DNGR-1 ECD to F-actin beads was reduced in the presence of sGSN ( Figure 1 D). The total amount of fluorescent rhodamine-actin on beads was unchanged by sGSN incubation ( Figure 1 D), and binding of anti-actin antibody was unaffected or even slightly increased, perhaps due to increased exposure of epitopes ( Figure 1 D). The latter observation suggests that sGSN outcompetes DNGR-1 for binding to F-actin rather than simply causing loss of the ligand from beads through filament severing. As expected, binding of sGSN to bead-bound F-actin and its ability to subsequently block DNGR-1 was prevented by calcium chelation ( Figure 1 E).
By selectively targeting the alternatively spliced exon in the mouse sGsn locus that encodes the signal peptide, we generated C57BL/6 mice that lack secreted gelsolin ( sGsn −/− ) but retain cytoplasmic GSN ( Figures 1 F and 1G). We verified that sGsn −/− mice develop and age normally ( Figure S1 A), as expected from the fact that total Gsn −/− mice (doubly deficient in cytoplasmic GSN and sGSN) display only a mild phenotype in the C57BL/6 genetic background ( Cantù et al., 2012 12. Cantù, C. ∙ Bosè, F. ∙ Bianchi, P. ... Defective erythroid maturation in gelsolin mutant mice Haematologica. 2012; 97 :980-988 Crossref Scopus (7) PubMed Google Scholar ; Witke et al., 1995 68. Witke, W. ∙ Sharpe, A.H. ∙ Hartwig, J.H. ... Hemostatic, inflammatory, and fibroblast responses are blunted in mice lacking gelsolin Cell. 1995; 81 :41-51 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (389) PubMed Google Scholar ). Immune profiling of sGsn −/− mice revealed overall normal myeloid and lymphoid cell composition in primary and secondary lymphoid organs ( Figures S1 B–S1I). Consistent with a normal immunological profile, sGsn −/− mice displayed no impairment in their ability to resist and respond to very distinct infectious challenges, namely parasite ( Nippostrongylus brasiliensis ) or viral (influenza A virus) infection ( Figures S1 J–S1N). They also showed no signs of autoimmunity, although they displayed marginally elevated levels of IgG and IgM auto-antibodies upon aging (>1 year; Figure S1 O).
Like FCS, serum from mice also inhibits DNGR-1 binding to immobilized F-actin ( Figure 1 H). Notably, inhibition was lost when we used serum from sGsn −/− mice ( Figure 1 H), indicating that circulating sGSN fully accounts for the inhibitory effect of serum on DNGR-1 binding to F-actin. To assess the impact on DNGR-1 function, we first used a reporter assay of DNGR-1 triggering ( Sancho et al., 2009 53. Sancho, D. ∙ Joffre, O.P. ∙ Keller, A.M. ... Identification of a dendritic cell receptor that couples sensing of necrosis to immunity Nature. 2009; 458 :899-903 Crossref Scopus (611) PubMed Google Scholar ) and tested the effect of adding serum from sGSN-deficient mice supplemented or not with a defined amount (10 μg/mL) of recombinant sGSN (a dose at least 10-fold lower than physiological levels of plasma sGSN). In the presence of sGSN, stimulation of the reporter cells with F-actin alone did not generate a signal up until a concentration of ligand (0.5 μM) that exceeded the amount of added sGSN (0.1 μM) by 5-fold ( Figure 2 A), suggesting that sGSN blocks DNGR-1 binding sites on F-actin in a stoichiometric manner. To assess the impact of sGSN on DNGR-1 triggering by dead cells, we used UV-irradiated mouse embryonic fibroblasts or tumor cells (see below) as stimuli. Again, we found inhibition of DNGR-1 triggering by dead cell corpses in the presence of sGSN ( Figure 2 B). In contrast, the absence or presence of sGSN did not impact stimulation of reporter cells with plate-bound anti-DNGR-1 antibody ( Figure S2 A), excluding non-specific effects.
Unlike sGSN, the other component of the actin-scavenging system, Gc globulin, cannot bind to F-actin ( Cooke and Haddad, 1989 15. Cooke, N.E. ∙ Haddad, J.G.

Consistent with that notion, inhibition of dead cell-induced stimulation of the reporter cells was similar whether the assay was carried out with serum from sGSN-deficient mice or serum from mice doubly deficient in sGSN and Gc ( Figure 2 C). Cytoplasmic gelsolin potentially released from dead cells was also not sufficient to interfere with DNGR-binding as the reporter cells were stimulated equally by killed cells from the parental (gelsolin-sufficient) 5555 Braf V600E tumor cell line and from a stable 5555 Braf V600E gelsolin knockdown (KD) line ( Figures 2 D and S2 B). This is likely a quantitative issue as cytoplasmic gelsolin released from dead cells is rapidly diluted to below 1 μg/mL, the concentration required to inhibit DNGR-1 triggering ( Figure S2 C). Finally, we examined the effect of sGSN on cross-presentation of dead cell-associated ovalbumin (OVA) antigen to CD8 + OT-I T cells by the Mutu cDC1 cell line ( Fuertes Marraco et al., 2012 18. Fuertes Marraco, S.A. ∙ Grosjean, F. ∙ Duval, A. ... Novel murine dendritic cell lines: a powerful auxiliary tool for dendritic cell research Front. Immunol. 2012; 3 :331 Crossref Scopus (104) PubMed Google Scholar ), which expresses DNGR-1 ( Hanč et al., 2016b 24. Hanč, P. ∙ Schulz, O. ∙ Fischbach, H. ... A pH- and ionic strength-dependent conformational change in the neck region regulates DNGR-1 function in dendritic cells EMBO J. 2016; 35 :2484-2497 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ). The OT-I response in cultures containing sGSN was significantly lower than that in sGSN-free mouse serum ( Figure 2 E). As controls, presentation of OVA (SIINFEKL) peptide or cross-presentation of soluble OVA protein was not affected by sGSN ( Figure S2 D), emphasizing the specificity of the inhibitory effect for cross-presentation of antigen derived from dead cells. We conclude that sGSN is necessary and sufficient for inhibition of dead cell recognition by DNGR-1 and for decreasing cross-presentation of dead cell-associated antigens.
As cross-presentation is a limiting factor in anti-tumor immunity ( Kozik et al., 2020 31. Kozik, P. ∙ Gros, M. ∙ Itzhak, D.N. ... Small Molecule Enhancers of Endosome-to-Cytosol Import Augment Anti-tumor Immunity Cell Rep. 2020; 32 :107905 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ), we hypothesized that sGsn −/− mice might display increased anti-tumor CD8 + T cell responses. Consistent with this possibility, highly immunogenic tumors derived from an OVA-expressing thymoma cell line (EG7) exhibited faster and increased regression in sGSN-deficient mice compared to C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) mice ( Figure S3 A). However, this was not universally seen with OVA-expressing tumors: a weakly immunogenic fibrosarcoma line (MCA-205) expressing OVA (lacking the signal sequence and fused to mCherry; Figure S3 B) was controlled similarly in sGSN-deficient and WT mice ( Figure S3 C). CD8 + T cell responses against neoantigens associated with the actin cytoskeleton can lead to partial or complete tumor regression in both mice and humans ( Matsushita et al., 2012 43. Matsushita, H. ∙ Vesely, M.D. ∙ Koboldt, D.C. ... Cancer exome analysis reveals a T-cell-dependent mechanism of cancer immunoediting Nature. 2012; 482 :400-404 Crossref Scopus (1007) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zorn and Hercend, 1999 72.

Immunol. 1999; 29 :592-601 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ). To test whether the relative tumor resistance of sGSN-deficient mice is more marked in settings in which the relevant tumor antigens are associated with the actin cytoskeleton, we fused the OVA-mCherry construct to the 17 amino acid sequence of the LifeAct F-actin binding peptide ( Riedl et al., 2008 48. Riedl, J. ∙ Crevenna, A.H. ∙ Kessenbrock, K. ... Lifeact: a versatile marker to visualize F-actin Nat. Methods. 2008; 5 :605-607 Crossref Scopus (1642) PubMed Google Scholar ) and expressed the new construct (LA-OVA-mCherry) in the same weakly immunogenic cancer cell line MCA-205 ( Figure S3 B). We found that sGsn −/− mice controlled LA-OVA-mCherry MCA-205 tumors much better than WT controls ( Figure 3 A). Indeed, complete rejection of these tumors accompanied by remission was only seen in sGsn -deficient hosts ( Figure 3 A). Similarly, expression of LA-OVA-mCherry in the poorly immunogenic B16F10 melanoma cell line permitted tumor control preferentially in the sGSN-deficient mouse strain ( Figure 3 B), which, as for MCA205, was not the case with B16F10 expressing OVA not fused to the LA peptide ( Figure S3 D). Further analysis clearly indicated that tumor control in sGsn −/− mice correlates with cytoskeletal association of antigen rather than antigen levels ( Figures S3 B and S3E). Control of LA-OVA-mCherry B16F10 tumors in sGsn −/− mice was further enhanced by anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade, which, by itself, had no effect in WT mice ( Figure 3 C). The tumor resistance phenotype of sGSN-deficient mice was also apparent with some unengineered tumor cell lines. This was the case with the 5555 Braf V600E melanoma cell line ( Dhomen et al., 2009 16. Dhomen, N. ∙ Reis-Filho, J.S. ∙ da Rocha Dias, S. ... Oncogenic Braf induces melanocyte senescence and melanoma in mice Cancer Cell. 2009; 15 :294-303 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (471) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 3 D) or even the parental MCA-205 line not expressing OVA when its immunogenicity was boosted by treating with the immune checkpoint inhibitor anti-CTLA-4 together with the immune stimulator poly(I:C) ( Figure 3 E). Thus, sGsn −/− mice exhibit greater resistance to a variety of immunogenic transplantable tumors, which is especially marked for those that bear tumor neoantigens that associate with the actin cytoskeleton.
Many cells can synthesize sGSN in addition to cytoplasmic gelsolin (cGSN), and sGSN can account for more than half of total gelsolin transcript expression in some tissues ( Figures S3 F–S3H). In line with this, several human cancers have been reported to secrete sGSN ( Asare-Werehene et al., 2020 4. Asare-Werehene, M. ∙ Nakka, K. ∙ Reunov, A. ...

(Berl.). 2012; 90 :187-200 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ), unlike the murine cancer cell lines used in this study ( Figure S3 I). We therefore overexpressed sGSN in MCA-205 LA-OVA-mCherry cells ( Figure S3 J) and challenged WT and sGsn −/− mice. As a control, we overexpressed cGSN , ensuring equal levels of expression by means of a surrogate GFP marker ( Figure S3 K). Notably, forced sGSN but not cGSN expression abrogated the relative resistance of sGsn −/− mice to LA-OVA-mCherry tumors ( Figure 3 F), indicating that sGSN secretion by cancer cells can function as an escape strategy.
The fact that sGsn −/− mice were more responsive to cancer immunotherapy suggested an immune-dependent mechanism of resistance. Analysis of the B16F10 LA-OVA-mCherry TME did not reveal any significant differences in composition between sGsn −/− and WT mice ( Figures 4 A–4E). There were also no differences in OVA-specific antibodies between tumor-bearing sGsn −/− and WT mice ( Figure S4 A). However, we found a higher number and frequency of intratumoral OVA-specific (pentamer + ) CD8 + T cells in sGsn −/− mice ( Figures 4 F and S4 B), indicating an enhanced antigen-specific response. Further, the observed relative tumor resistance of sGsn −/− mice was abrogated by antibody-mediated CD8 + T cell depletion ( Figures 4 G and 4H). Therefore, the relative tumor resistance of sGsn −/− mice appears due to an antigen-specific CD8 + T cell response.
We tested the possibility that this reflected stronger DNGR-1 activity and generated additional control mice lacking both DNGR-1 and sGSN ( sGsn −/− ; Clec9a gfp/gfp ). Previous work shows that DNGR-1 does not impact dead cell uptake by cDC1s or cDC1 differentiation, migration, or activation ( Canton et al., 2021 11. Canton, J. ∙ Blees, H. ∙ Henry, C.M. ... The receptor DNGR-1 signals for phagosomal rupture to promote cross-presentation of dead-cell-associated antigens Nat. Immunol. 2021; 22 :140-153 Crossref Scopus (100) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sancho et al., 2009 53. Sancho, D. ∙ Joffre, O.P. ∙ Keller, A.M. ... Identification of a dendritic cell receptor that couples sensing of necrosis to immunity Nature. 2009; 458 :899-903 Crossref Scopus (611) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zelenay et al., 2012 70. Zelenay, S. ∙ Keller, A.M. ∙ Whitney, P.G. ... The dendritic cell receptor DNGR-1 controls endocytic handling of necrotic cell antigens to favor cross-priming of CTLs in virus-infected mice J. Clin. Invest. 2012; 122 :1615-1627 Crossref Scopus (212) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistent with this notion, sGSN single or sGSN-DNGR-1 double deficiency did not impact the frequency or number of cDC1 within MCA205 or B16F10 LA-OVA-mCherry tumors or in tumor-draining lymph nodes (tdLNs; Figures S4 C and S4D). Using the mCherry signal as a surrogate for uptake and retention of tumor cell material, we found, as expected ( Roberts et al., 2016 49. Roberts, E.W. ∙ Broz, M.L. ∙ Binnewies, M. ... Critical Role for CD103(+)/CD141(+) Dendritic Cells Bearing CCR7 for Tumor Antigen Trafficking and Priming of T Cell Immunity in Melanoma Cancer Cell. 2016; 30 :324-336 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (683) PubMed Google Scholar ), that it was sampled in the TME and transported to tdLNs by migratory cDC1s and cDC2s ( Figure S4 E). However, DNGR-1 and/or sGSN deficiency did not alter the frequency of mCherry + cDC1s in tumors or of mCherry + migratory cDC1s in tdLNs ( Figures 5 A, S4 F, and S4G). Finally, we confirmed that deficiency in sGSN, irrespective of presence or absence of DNGR-1, did not affect cDC1 activation as measured by levels of CD86 and MHC class II in either TME or tdLNs ( Figures 5 B and S4 H).
The above data are consistent with the notion that DNGR-1 is a dedicated receptor for cross-presentation of dead-cell-associated antigens, acting post-uptake to promote rupture of phagosomes and access of internalized tumor debris to the cytosolic MHC class I presentation pathway of cDC1s ( Canton et al., 2021 11. Canton, J. ∙ Blees, H. ∙ Henry, C.M. ... The receptor DNGR-1 signals for phagosomal rupture to promote cross-presentation of dead-cell-associated antigens Nat. Immunol. 2021; 22 :140-153 Crossref Scopus (100) PubMed Google Scholar ). To assess this directly, we sorted migratory cDC1s from the tdLNs of mice bearing B16F10 LA-OVA-mCherry tumors and co-cultured them with naive OVA-specific OT-I CD8 + T cells. Enhanced proliferation and activation of OT-I T cells was seen with migratory cDC1s from tumor-bearing sGsn −/− mice but not with those from sGsn −/− Clec9a gfp/gfp mice ( Figures 5 C and S4 I). As a control, migratory cDC1s from all mice stimulated OT-I equally when pulsed with OVA peptide ex vivo ( Figure S4 J). Notably, loss of Clec9a completely reversed the relative resistance of sGSN-deficient mice to MCA-205 and B16F10 LA-OVA-mCherry tumors ( Figures 5 D and 5E) but did not impact growth of the same cancers in sGSN-sufficient hosts ( Figures S4 K and S4L). Collectively, our data indicate a role for DNGR-1 in promoting cross-presentation of tumor antigens in the sGsn -deficient background, which leads to priming of anti-tumor CD8 + T cells that mediate cancer rejection.
Given the results in Figure 3 F, we hypothesized that, for some cancers, production of sGSN by tumor ( Asare-Werehene et al., 2020 4. Asare-Werehene, M. ∙ Nakka, K. ∙ Reunov, A. ... The exosome-mediated autocrine and paracrine actions of plasma gelsolin in ovarian cancer chemoresistance Oncogene. 2020; 39 :1600-1616 Crossref Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar ; Chen et al., 2017 14.

Tsai, M.-H. ∙ Wu, C.-C. ∙ Peng, P.-H. ... Identification of secretory gelsolin as a plasma biomarker associated with distant organ metastasis of colorectal cancer J. Mol. Med. (Berl.). 2012; 90 :187-200 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ) and tumor-infiltrating cells could lead to elevated levels of the protein in the TME irrespective of the amount circulating in plasma, impacting immunity and patient outcome. We performed in silico analysis of gelsolin isoform expression using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA; https://www.cancer.gov/tcga ) for 10 cancers including skin, liver, breast, lung, pancreatic, prostate, low-grade glioma (LGG), head and neck, stomach, and colorectal. Due to the limited dynamic range of sGSN transcript levels, slightly different cutoffs were used for different cancers in order to allow for maximum segregation between the highest and lowest expressors while retaining enough data points for comprehensive analysis. For seven cancer types, expression levels of sGSN did not impact overall survival irrespective of the cutoff chosen (data not shown). However, analysis of liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC, n = 370), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC, n = 518) and stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD, n = 408) revealed that lower sGSN transcript expression correlated positively with survival ( Figure 6 A), a difference that was not attributable to age, sex, or disease stage ( Table S1 ). In the same cancers, the expression of the cytoplasmic gelsolin isoform ( cGSN ) did not correlate with patient survival, highlighting a specific association of sGSN but not cGSN with cancer progression ( Figure S5 A). Comparison of low versus high sGSN tumors using REACTOME pathway analysis revealed that sGSN Low LIHC, HNSC, and STAD cancers displayed specific enrichment for gene signatures of antigen processing, MHC class I (cross-)presentation, cell death and, except for STAD, gene signatures of adaptive immunity ( Figure 6 B). Thus, the survival benefit seen in the low sGSN group of LIHC, HNSC, and STAD tumors is broadly associated with gene signatures of anti-tumor immunity.
Separately, we determined the prognostic value of CLEC9A transcript levels in overall cancer survival by comparing top and bottom patient quartiles ( Böttcher et al., 2018 8. Böttcher, J.P. ∙ Bonavita, E. ∙ Chakravarty, P. ... NK Cells Stimulate Recruitment of cDC1 into the Tumor Microenvironment Promoting Cancer Immune Control Cell. 2018; 172 :1022-1037.e14 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1173) PubMed Google Scholar ). CLEC9A expression correlated positively with patient overall survival in LIHC and HNSC but not in the STAD dataset ( Figure S5 B). The latter therefore allowed us to examine whether CLEC9A expression predicted overall survival selectively in the low sGSN STAD patient group. Strikingly, we found that this was the case ( Figures 6 C and S5 C) and that it was specific for sGSN, as higher CLEC9A expression did not correlate with survival when patients were stratified on the basis of expression of cGSN ( Figure S5 D). CLEC9A is a marker of cDC1s, but a specific cDC1 gene signature ( Böttcher et al., 2018 8. Böttcher, J.P. ∙ Bonavita, E. ∙ Chakravarty, P. ... NK Cells Stimulate Recruitment of cDC1 into the Tumor Microenvironment Promoting Cancer Immune Control Cell. 2018; 172 :1022-1037.e14 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1173) PubMed Google Scholar ) did not associate with STAD patient survival irrespective of sGSN expression levels ( Figures S5 E and S5F), which suggests that the association of CLEC9A with patient survival in the low sGSN patient group might predominantly reflect DNGR-1 receptor function rather than intratumoral cDC1 abundance. Interestingly, both CLEC9A and an “effector CD8 T cell” gene signature ( Böttcher et al., 2018 8. Böttcher, J.P. ∙ Bonavita, E. ∙ Chakravarty, P. ... NK Cells Stimulate Recruitment of cDC1 into the Tumor Microenvironment Promoting Cancer Immune Control Cell. 2018; 172 :1022-1037.e14 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1173) PubMed Google Scholar ) correlated with “MHC class I (cross-)presentation-related” gene signatures more strongly in the low sGSN than in the high sGSN subgroup of STAD patients ( Figure 6 D). Furthermore, CLEC9A and “effector CD8 T cell” gene signature also cross-correlated to a greater extent in the low sGSN subgroup when compared together as part of “MHC class I (cross-)presentation related” gene signatures, highlighting their potential intersection in a common pathway ( Figure 6 E). Importantly, by examining the top and bottom quartiles as described before ( Mariathasan et al., 2018 42. Mariathasan, S. ∙ Turley, S.J. ∙ Nickles, D. ... TGFβ attenuates tumour response to PD-L1 blockade by contributing to exclusion of T cells Nature. 2018; 554 :544-548 Crossref Scopus (3242) PubMed Google Scholar ), we found that, although “effector CD8 T cell” and “cross-presentation related” gene signatures did not associate with survival in STAD patients on their own ( Figures S5 G and S5I), in conjunction, they were able to predict survival selectively in the low sGSN patient subgroup, much like CLEC9A expression ( Figures 6 F and S5 J–S5L). Thus, in humans, as in mice, sGSN expression is associated with poorer cancer outcome, which correlates with lower CLEC9A-CD8 T cell immune-mediated control.
As described above, DNGR-1-dependent control of cancer in sGsn −/− mice was most marked for transplantable tumors bearing the LA-OVA model antigen. This suggested that neoantigens resulting from mutations in proteins that associate with F-actin might be preferentially immunogenic in sGSN Low patients. We therefore examined LIHC, HNSC, and STAD patients for mutational burden in F-actin-binding proteins (FABPs; Table S2 ) compared to total mutational burden or, as a specificity control, mutational burden in microtubule-binding proteins (MBPs; Table S3 ). In LIHC, HNSC, and, in particular, STAD we identified multiple patients with one or more non-silent mutations in the coding regions of one or more genes encoding FABPs ( Figure 7 A). LIHC but not HNSC and STAD patients bearing FABP mutations displayed better overall survival in the absence of additional stratification ( Figure S6 A). However, when patients were further stratified by intratumoral sGSN transcript levels, it became obvious that the combination of low sGSN together with mutations in FABP offered the best correlation with overall survival across all three cancer types ( Figure 7 B). This was not seen when the analysis was performed using (cytoplasmic) cGSN transcripts as the binning criterion ( Figure S6 B). Further, it was specific to patients with mutations in FABPs as it was not seen when stratification was carried out on the basis of total mutational burden ( Figure S6 C) or mutations in MBPs ( Figure 7 C). Moreover, even in a cancer such as LGG (n = 515), in which low sGSN expression did not by itself predict survival ( Figure S6 D), mutational burden in FABPs but not total mutational burden or mutations in MBPs revealed a correlation with intratumoral sGSN ( Figures 7 D–7F and S6 E) but not cGSN ( Figure S6 F) expression at the level of overall survival. As seen with STAD patients, increased patient survival in LGG required the intersection of low levels of sGSN transcripts and high levels of CLEC9A transcripts ( Figures S6 G and S6H). In contrast, the intersection of CLEC9A expression with expression of cytoplasmic cGSN did not correlate with survival ( Figure S6 I), and a cDC1 gene signature did not substitute for CLEC9A ( Figures S6 J and S6K). Furthermore, as observed with STAD patients, in the sub-group of LGG with lower sGSN expression, there was a strong correlation between gene signatures for “ CLEC9A -ER phagosome pathway” and “effector CD8 T cell-cross-presentation related” ( Figure S6 L). Collectively, these data suggest that low sGSN expression may selectively enhance immune responses to neoantigens associated with the actin cytoskeleton and patient survival even in cancers such as LGG and LIHC with low mutational burden ( Figures S7 A–S7D).

Section: Discussion

cDC1s have emerged as key players in cross-priming of anti-tumor CD8 + T cells and in the response to cancer immunotherapy ( Broz et al., 2014 9. Broz, M.L. ∙ Binnewies, M. ∙ Boldajipour, B. ...

We and others have shown that cancer cells can block recruitment of cDC1s to escape CD8 + T cell immunosurveillance ( Böttcher et al., 2018 8. Böttcher, J.P. ∙ Bonavita, E. ∙ Chakravarty, P. ...

However, little is known as to whether antigen acquisition and presentation functions of cDC1s are impacted by tumor- or host-derived factors. Furthermore, although the abundance of the cDC1 hallmark transcripts, such as CLEC9A , in tumors correlates positively with cancer patient survival ( Barry et al., 2018 6.

Immunol. 2018; 19 :885-897 Crossref Scopus (151) PubMed Google Scholar ), it is unclear if this reflects a role of the corresponding gene products in cDC1-mediated anti-tumor immunity. Here, we show that the CLEC9A product, DNGR-1, can promote cross-presentation of dead tumor cell antigens leading to anti-tumor immunity but that this effect is often masked by sGSN produced either locally in the TME or circulating in plasma. Thus, sGSN can dictate the degree to which tumor antigenicity is revealed to the CD8 + T cell compartment by cDC1s via DNGR-1-mediated cross-presentation.
DNGR-1 functions in cDC1s by recognizing F-actin on necrotic cargo and signaling to promote phagosomal rupture, with consequent access of dead cell-associated antigens to the cytosolic MHC class I antigen processing pathway ( Canton et al., 2021 11. Canton, J. ∙ Blees, H. ∙ Henry, C.M. ... The receptor DNGR-1 signals for phagosomal rupture to promote cross-presentation of dead-cell-associated antigens Nat. Immunol. 2021; 22 :140-153 Crossref Scopus (100) PubMed Google Scholar ). Rupture is determined in part by the extent of DNGR-1 triggering and therefore is expected to be biased toward phagosomes containing debris with the highest actin cytoskeletal content. Together with the fact that the debris is at various stages of dissolution and leaching its soluble contents, it is likely that DNGR-1-dependent phagosomal rupture will bias cross-presentation toward those antigens that are most intimately associated with actin filaments ( Figure S7 E). Indeed, our findings suggest that DNGR-1-dependent cross-presentation, when not blocked by sGSN, favors cross-priming of anti-tumor CD8 + T cells specific for mutated proteins that are part of the actin cytoskeleton ( Figure S7 E). Interestingly, mutations in FABPs occur frequently in the vast majority of human cancers and can generate tumor neoantigens in both mice and humans ( Matsushita et al., 2012 43. Matsushita, H. ∙ Vesely, M.D. ∙ Koboldt, D.C. ... Cancer exome analysis reveals a T-cell-dependent mechanism of cancer immunoediting Nature. 2012; 482 :400-404 Crossref Scopus (1007) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zorn and Hercend, 1999 72.

Immunol. 1999; 29 :592-601 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ). The fact that such mutations correlate with better prognosis specifically in patients whose tumors have relatively low sGSN transcript levels suggests that local production of sGSN in the TME may be a means of evading DNGR-1-dependent induction of anti-tumor immunity irrespective of plasma sGSN levels. Consistent with that notion, we show that ectopic expression of sGSN is sufficient to promote immune escape of murine tumors even in sGsn −/− mice ( Figure 3 F).
In our analysis, the prognostic value of TME sGSN expression was restricted to specific cancer subtypes (liver, head and neck, stomach cancers, and LGG). The lack of prognostic value of tumor-derived sGSN transcript expression in the other six analyzed TCGA datasets could reflect the shortcomings of estimating local sGSN protein levels based on mRNA counts. Consistent with that possibility, high levels of sGSN proteins have been reported in ovarian and prostate cancer and found to be associated with poorer clinical outcome ( Asare-Werehene et al., 2020 4. Asare-Werehene, M. ∙ Nakka, K. ∙ Reunov, A. ... The exosome-mediated autocrine and paracrine actions of plasma gelsolin in ovarian cancer chemoresistance Oncogene. 2020; 39 :1600-1616 Crossref Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar ; Chen et al., 2017 14. Chen, C.-C. ∙ Chiou, S.-H. ∙ Yang, C.-L. ... Secreted gelsolin desensitizes and induces apoptosis of infiltrated lymphocytes in prostate cancer Oncotarget. 2017; 8 :77152-77167 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, it is also likely that, for many cancers, local production of sGSN is functionally redundant in the face of high circulating levels of sGSN in plasma. Indeed, our mouse data indicate that plasma sGSN is amply sufficient to dampen anti-tumor immunity in many instances. Interestingly, perhaps related to our findings with sGsn -deficient mice, it has been reported that patients with Meretoja’s disease, in which proteolytic cleavage leads to loss of sGSN function, display a lower prevalence of fatal cancers ( Schmidt et al., 2016 54. Schmidt, E.-K. ∙ Atula, S. ∙ Tanskanen, M. ... Causes of death and life span in Finnish gelsolin amyloidosis Ann. Med. 2016; 48 :352-358 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ). Finally, irrespective of sGSN, it is important to note that cDC1s and/or DNGR-1-mediated cross-presentation might be dispensable for immunity to some cancer types ( Asano et al., 2011 3. Asano, K. ∙ Nabeyama, A. ∙ Miyake, Y. ... CD169-positive macrophages dominate antitumor immunity by crosspresenting dead cell-associated antigens Immunity. 2011; 34 :85-95 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (359) PubMed Google Scholar ; Gilfillan et al., 2018 20. Gilfillan, C.B. ∙ Kuhn, S. ∙ Baey, C. ... Clec9A + Dendritic Cells Are Not Essential for Antitumor CD8 + T Cell Responses Induced by Poly I:C Immunotherapy J. Immunol. 2018; 200 :2978-2986 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ma et al., 2013 41. Ma, Y. ∙ Adjemian, S. ∙ Mattarollo, S.R. ... Anticancer chemotherapy-induced intratumoral recruitment and differentiation of antigen-presenting cells Immunity. 2013; 38 :729-741 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (547) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Collectively, our data identify sGSN as a hitherto unsuspected player in tumor evasion of immunity. They further reveal that DNGR-1-mediated cross-presentation favors immune visibility of cancer clones bearing sequence mutations in proteins of the actin cytoskeleton, which are surprisingly common even in patients with low overall mutational burden ( Figures S7 A and S7B). In physiology, sGSN inhibition of DNGR-1 activity might help prevent inappropriate immune responses to cytoskeletal antigens (e.g., myositis). This remains to be assessed, as does the more general point of the extent to which sGSN acts as a barrier to autoimmunity, which can be explored in the future by testing sGsn −/− mice. However, we note that these mice, at least on a C57BL/6 background, do not display signs of spontaneous autoimmunity. Transiently targeting the interaction between sGSN and F-actin might therefore constitute a safe and attractive strategy for tumor immunotherapy. If one can circumvent the difficulty posed by the high concentration of sGSN in plasma, sGSN blockade in the TME could boost the antigenic visibility of tumor cells and, in conjunction with checkpoint blockade immunotherapy, help augment cancer control by CD8 + T cells.
Our results argue that DNGR-1 preferentially promotes cross-presentation of tumor antigens associated with the actin cytoskeleton and that this is opposed by sGSN from circulation or produced by tumor cells. We used LA-OVA, in which OVA is fused to the Lifeact F-actin binding peptide in proof-of-principle studies in mice, but it will be important to extend those findings to tumor cells expressing a bona fide FABP neoantigen. In addition, the full extent to which the DNGR-1-sGSN cross-presentation axis shapes the antigenic repertoire of cancer cells will require analysis of immunoediting of chemically induced cancers ( Matsushita et al., 2012 43. Matsushita, H. ∙ Vesely, M.D. ∙ Koboldt, D.C. ...

Mice selectively lacking sGSN ( sGsn −/− ) were generated by microinjection of mRNA Cas9(D10A) and in vitro transcribed paired guide RNAs (gRNAs), targeting the alternatively-spliced exon coding for the signal peptide of the sGSN gene product, into fertilized single cell staged C57BL/6J embryos ( Figure 1 F). Embryos carrying correctly targeted mutations were selected and founder lines were established. One founder line carrying the targeted allele Gsn em2(sGsn)Crs ( Figure 1 G) was designated sGsn −/− and used for these studies. Gc −/− mice carrying the Gc tm1.1(KOMP)Vlcg allele on a C57BL/6 background were purchased from KOMP repository. Mice doubly deficient for either sGSN and DNGR-1 ( sGsn −/− ;Clec9a gfp/gfp ) or sGSN and Gc ( sGsn −/− ;Gc −/− ) were generated by crossing sGsn −/− mice with either DNGR-1-deficient mice ( Clec9a tm1.1Crs a.k.a., Clec9a gfp/gfp ( Sancho et al., 2009 53.

The above mice, as well as C57BL/6, Clec9a gfp/gfp , another line of DNGR-1 deficient mice ( Clec9a cre/cre ; ( Schraml et al., 2013 55. Schraml, B.U. ∙ van Blijswijk, J. ∙ Zelenay, S. ...

Mouse genotypes were determined using real time PCR with specific probes designed for each gene (Transnetyx, Cordova, TN). Serum was collected from aged C57BL/6J and sGsn −/− mice, and sent to the UT Southwestern Medical Centre Microarray Core facility for autoantibody determination using their autoantigen microarray.
Mice were used at 5 – 12 weeks of age for experiments. For tumor challenge, males and females were used as we did not observe sexual dimorphism (not shown). However, in any one experiment, mice were sex-matched and randomly assigned to treatment or control groups. Mice of different genotypes were littermates and/or co-housed for a minimum of 3 weeks before experiments. Animal experiments were performed in accordance with national and institutional guidelines for animal care and were approved by the Francis Crick Institute Biological Resources Facility Strategic Oversight Committee (incorporating the Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body) and by the Home Office, UK.

For retroviral transduction of cancer cell lines, retrovirus was packaged in 293T cells transfected with a mixture of plasmids: 2 μg of pVSV-G envelope protein-coding plasmid, 3.72 μg of pHIV (gag-pol) packaging plasmid and 10 μg of pMSCV-IRES-Life-Act-OVA-mCherry plasmid using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After two days post-transfection, the pseudotyped virus-containing culture media was harvested, filtered and used to infect target cells (B16F10 and MCA-205) in the presence of 10 μg/mL polybrene. After two rounds of infection the medium in the target cells was exchanged for fresh complete RPMI1640 medium. For positive clone selection the medium was supplemented with puromycin (1.5 μg/mL for B16F10 and 5 μg/mL for MCA-205) and after three passages target cells were FACS-sorted based on mCherry expression. For lentiviral transduction, 293T cells were co-transfected with a mixture of 2 μg of pVSV-G envelope protein-coding plasmid, 3.72 μg of psPAX2 packaging plasmid and 10 μg of PLKO.1-puro-Gsn ShRNA (mouse shRNA, TRCN0000071930, mature sequence anti-sense: TTCAGACACGTGTACTTGAGC) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Viral infection and subsequent selection was performed as above. 5555 Braf V600E Gsn knockdown (KD) cells were positively selected using puromycin (1 μg/mL) containing medium. The MCA-205 LA-OVA-mCherry expressing either cGSN or sGSN achieved using the sleeping beauty transposon system. In brief, cGSN and sGSN RNA was extracted from mouse muscles, converted into cDNA and subsequently cloned into the pSBbi-GFP-hygromycin (GH) resistant vector (Addgene). MCA-205 LA-OVA-mCherry cells were transfected with a mixture of plasmids: 0.4 ug transposase (Addgene) and 1.6 ug pSBbi-GFP-GH using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). For positive clone selection GFP + cells have been sorted using FACS.
Tumor cells were dissociated with trypsin (0.25%), and washed three times in PBS. The final cell pellet was resuspended and diluted in endotoxin-free PBS (between 0.2 × 10 6 to 0.5 × 10 6 cells per 100 μl) and injected s.c. in the shaved right flank of each recipient mouse. Tumor growth was monitored every 1 to 3 days, and the longest tumor diameter ( l ) and perpendicular width ( w ) were measured using digital Vernier callipers; tumor volume was calculated using the formula: length × width 2 /2 and expressed as mm 3 ( Faustino-Rocha et al., 2013 17.

Myosin II Synergizes with F-Actin to Promote DNGR-1-Dependent Cross-Presentation of Dead Cell-Associated Antigens Cell Rep. 2018; 24 :419-428 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, F-actin was transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes by gravity flow using a dot blot apparatus. Post-transfer, membranes were blocked in 5% milk, cut into strips, and either probed directly as per the published protocol or incubated with mouse serum, heat-inactivated FCS or the purified ABPs in blocking solution (5% milk) for 1-2 h, washed and then probed with FLAG-tagged mDNGR-1 ECD followed by HRP-conjugated mouse anti-FLAG antibody (M2, Sigma, 1:20000 dilution). For western blot of mouse serum, equivalent volumes of serum samples were diluted in Laemmli buffer, resolved using reducing SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Merck-Millipore). For cytoplasmic gelsolin, splenic lysates were prepared by homogenization using a TissueLyser II (QIAGEN) in cold protein lysis buffer (RIPA supplemented with protease inhibitors (Roche) before quantification of supernatants using BCA (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Equal amounts of protein were diluted in Laemmli buffer, resolved using reducing SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Merck-Millipore). Secreted, cytoplasmic gelsolin and OVA levels were assessed by probing membranes with anti-gelsolin antibody (D9W8Y, Cell Signaling Technology, 1:1000 dilution) or anti-OVA antibody (polyclonal antibody, Sigma, 1:1000), respectively, followed by HRP-anti-rabbit antibody (1:5000 dilution). Loading controls were developed using HRP-anti-mouse IgG (polyclonal, Life Technologies, 1:10000) for serum or HRP-anti-β-actin (AC-15, Sigma, 1:10000) for lysates. Visualization was carried out with the SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent substrate kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
F-actin was prepared as described ( Ahrens et al., 2012 1. Ahrens, S. ∙ Zelenay, S. ∙ Sancho, D. ... F-actin is an evolutionarily conserved damage-associated molecular pattern recognized by DNGR-1, a receptor for dead cells Immunity. 2012; 36 :635-645 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (322) PubMed Google Scholar ; Schulz et al., 2018 57.

Myosin II Synergizes with F-Actin to Promote DNGR-1-Dependent Cross-Presentation of Dead Cell-Associated Antigens Cell Rep. 2018; 24 :419-428 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, G-actin (10 mg/mL, 200 μM) stock was diluted 1:10 in a mixture of 1x G-actin buffer and 10x F-actin buffer and left at RT for at least 1 h to induce filament formation. Soluble F-actin (20 μM) was then diluted 1:4 in PBS. F-actin was incubated for 1 h at RT and adjusted to the final assay concentration (top dose) with PBS. Dilution series of F-actin preparations were prepared in PBS and used directly for dot blot and reporter cell assays. For coupling to beads, biotinylated, fluorescent F-actin was prepared by mixing equal amounts (20 μl) of rhodamine-G-actin and biotinylated G-actin (both at 20 μM, 1 mg/mL) in the presence of equimolar concentration (20 μM) of phalloidin in 5 μl G-buffer followed by addition of 5 μl 10x F-buffer to start the polymerization reaction (1 h, RT). 12.5 μl of phalloidin-stabilized, rhodamine-labeled and biotinylated F-actin (16 μM) was mixed with 37.5 μl PBS (for F-actin beads) for a final concentration of 4 μM and incubated for 1 h at RT.
4 μM biotin/rhodamine-F-actin or biotin/rhodamine-F-actin was diluted 1:4 with PBS and 100 μl was added to 20 μl streptavidin-coated beads (2μm; Polysciences Inc.), which had been washed twice with wash buffer (PBS + 1% BSA), for 30 min on ice. Washed beads were resuspended in wash buffer and sonicated (2 × 2 min) in a water bath sonicator before storage. F-actin-coupled microbeads were resuspended in HBSS containing 1 mM Ca 2+ and 10 μg/mL sGsn and incubated for 30 min on ice, followed by addition of FLAG-mDNGR-1 reagent. Beads were washed and stained with fluorescent-labeled antibodies including AlexaFluor647-conjugated rat-anti-DNGR-1 antibody (1F6) and AlexaFluor488-conjugated mouse-anti-human gelsolin antibody. Duplicate samples were stained with mouse anti-actin antibody (AC-40) followed by AlexaFluor488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody.
cDC1-mediated cross-presentation of bm1OVAMEF and 5555 Braf V600E cells was carried out as described recently ( Schulz et al., 2018 57. Schulz, O. ∙ Hanč, P. ∙ Böttcher, J.P. ... Myosin II Synergizes with F-Actin to Promote DNGR-1-Dependent Cross-Presentation of Dead Cell-Associated Antigens Cell Rep. 2018; 24 :419-428 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, cells were UV-irradiated (240 mJ/cm 2 ) and left for several h in serum-free RPMI1640 medium. 5555 Braf V600E cells were additionally pulsed with OVA (10 mg/mL) for 1 h at 37°C. Dead cells were added to Mutu DCs (1x10 5 /well) at the indicated ratio and cultured in 96-well round-bottom plates at 37°C in RPMI 1640 medium containing 2 mM glutamine, 50 μM 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 units/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin and 2.5% heat-inactivated sGsn-deficient mouse serum. To facilitate dead cell uptake, plates were centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 3 min at the start of the incubation. Pre-activated OT-I T cells (5x10 4 /well) ( Hanč et al., 2016b 24. Hanč, P. ∙ Schulz, O. ∙ Fischbach, H. ... A pH- and ionic strength-dependent conformational change in the neck region regulates DNGR-1 function in dendritic cells EMBO J. 2016; 35 :2484-2497 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ) were added after 4 h and OT-I T cell activation was determined by measuring IFN-γ levels in the supernatant of overnight cultures by ELISA.
N. brasiliensis was a generous gift from Judi Allen (University of Manchester). The parasite was maintained by serial passage through rats, as described previously ( Camberis et al., 2003 10. Camberis, M. ∙ Le Gros, G. ∙ Urban, J. Animal model of Nippostrongylus brasiliensis and Heligmosomoides polygyrus Curr. Protoc. Immunol. 2003; Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). L3 larvae were extracted from faecal pellets by use of a modified Baermann apparatus and collected in PBS. After at least 3 rounds of washing in sterile PBS, larval numbers were counted and further diluted as needed. Mice were infected subcutaneously with 250 L3 larvae per mouse. For analysis by RT-qPCR, broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples taken at sacrifice were immediately transferred into lysis buffer. Approximately 20 μg tissue from each lung was homogenized using a TissueLyser II (QIAGEN) and clarified using QiaShredder columns (QIAGEN). RNA was extracted using a column-based method (QIAGEN). cDNA synthesis was performed using SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and random hexamers (Thermo Fischer Scientific). cDNA was then diluted eight times in nuclease-free water and analyzed for transcript presence by qPCR using PowerUp SYBR Green master mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Reactions were carried out using QuantStudio 3 or QuantStudio 5 machines (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Primers sequences for qRT-PCR used can be found in Table S4 . Relative expression values were calculated from ΔCts using 18S mRNA as a reference gene. For analysis of BALF cellular content, BALF samples were centrifuged for 8 min at 1400 rpm and the pellet was resuspended in FACS buffer (PBS with 4% FCS, 5 mM EDTA and 0.2% azide), washed once, and then resuspended in PBS for staining. For analysis of total lung leukocyte content, lungs were chopped to small pieces and digested with collagenase IV (200 U/mL) and DNase I (100 mg/mL) for 60 min at 37 þC. Tissue was passed through a 70 μm cell strainer (Falcon) and resuspended in Percoll (GE Healthcare). Leukocytes were enriched by Percoll gradient, washed once with FACS buffer, and resuspended in PBS for staining.
For BALF and lung leukocyte staining, samples were incubated with Fc block for 10-15 min on ice, and subsequently stained for 20-30 min on ice in the dark. Following staining, samples were washed once in PBS and fixed (Nordic-MUbio). Samples were then washed three times and stored at 4 þC in the dark until acquisition on a LSR Fortessa (BD Biosciences). Quantification of total cell numbers by flow cytometry was done using beads (Beckman Coulter). Analysis of data was done in FlowJo. After gating on live, single cells, immune cell populations were defined the following: alveolar macrophages (CD45 + CD64 + F4/80 + CD11c + CD11b - ), monocytes (CD45 + CD64 - F4/80 - Ly-6G - Ly-6C + ), dendritic cells (CD45 + CD64 - F4/80 - MHCII + CD11c + ), neutrophils (CD45 + CD64 - F4/80 - Ly-6G + Ly-6C + ), eosinophils (CD45 + CD64 - F4/80 - Siglec-F + ).
Cytokines were measured in undiluted BALF. All cytokine levels, were assessed using cytometric bead array according to the manufacturer’s instruction (BD Biosciences).
Mouse serum was prepared from blood collected by cardiac puncture, immediately placed into clotting-activator containing microtubes (1.1 mL Z-gel, Sarstedt), allowed to coagulate for 30 min at room temperature and centrifuged (10,000 rpm, 2 min). OVA-specific antibodies were measured in the serum of tumor-bearing mice by ELISA. Ten-fold serial dilutions of serum samples were added to Iimmunoplates coated with ovalbumin (100 μg/mL) and OVA-specific IgG was detected using a mouse-specific anti-IgG antibody. EC 50 values for each serum sample were calculated from the titration curves using an algorithm supplied by the ELISA plate reader (SoftMax Pro) and mice whose titer could not be calculated or was above 0.15 were excluded from the analysis.
Influenza A virus (X31) was a gift from Andreas Wack (The Francis Crick Institute). Mice were infected intranasally with 2.4x10 3 TCID 50 per mouse. Lungs were harvested 40 days after infection and single cell suspensions were prepared by collagenase IV/DNase I digestion (see below). Influenza A - specific CD8 + memory T cells were analyzed by FACS following staining of lung cells with D b -NP 366-374 pentamer and antibodies against CD8, CD103, CD62L and CD44. The percentage of pentamer + CD103 - effector memory T cells were analyzed after gating on CD8 + CD44 + CD62L - cells. Quantification of total cell numbers by flow cytometry was done using beads (Beckman Coulter). Analysis of data was done in FlowJo.
Tumors and tumor draining lymph nodes (tdLN) were excised at the indicated days after cell transplantation. Tumor mass of individual tumors was determined using a microscale. For subsequent analysis by flow cytometry, tumors and tdLN were cut into pieces and digested with collagenase IV (200 U/mL) and DNase I (100 μg/mL) for 30 min at 37°C. Tissue was passed through a 70 μm cell strainer (Falcon), washed with FACS buffer (PBS with1%FCS and 2mM EDTA) and cells were incubated with Fc block (CD16/32, clone 2.4G2, BD Biosciences) for 10 min in 4°C before proceeding with antibody mediated staining.

Normalized read counts for gelsolin isoform expression were downloaded from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) resourse Biobank [ https://gtexportal.org ]. Raw count data for each TCGA dataset was downloaded from [ https://gdac.broadinstitute.org/ ] and normalized using DESEQ2 ( Love et al., 2014 40. Love, M.I. ∙ Huber, W. ∙ Anders, S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2 Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :550 Crossref Scopus (48397) PubMed Google Scholar ). Tumor only samples were ranked using normalized GSN expression. Differential expression between low and high expressing GSN groups was determined using the Wald’s test. The Wald’s statistic was used to rank genes using Preranked GSEA (version 2.2.3) ( Subramanian et al., 2005 62. Subramanian, A. ∙ Tamayo, P. ∙ Mootha, V.K. ...

Total tumor mutational counts, mutational counts for F-actin binding proteins ( Table S2 ) and microtubule binding proteins ( Table S3 ) for each TCGA dataset were downloaded from the TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas [ https://www.cbioportal.org ].
All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad). Statistical significance between two groups was determined using an unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test. Statistical analyses for two or more groups were done by one or two way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni multiple-comparison post hoc correction. One-way ANOVA was used to compare average means of two or more groups obtained in a single time point. Two-way ANOVA was used to compare average means of two or more dose response curves for in vitro assays and individual means per time point for tumor growth profiles. The Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test was used to determine statistical significance for overall survival in cancer patient data from TCGA. In the gene-enrichment analysis using genes were ranked by the Wald’s test false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted p were calculated. Auto-antibody scores were compared using two-tailed Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test. Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r) was calculated as a measure of the strength of the association between the expression values of two genes or gene signatures. Finally, two- tailed chi-square was used to determine any significant differences in frequencies of different clinical parameters between two groups. Data are shown as mean ± SD or mean ± SEM as indicated in the figure legends. Significance was assumed with ∗ p < 0.05; ∗∗ p < 0.01; ∗∗∗ p < 0.001, ∗∗∗∗ p < 0.0001.
