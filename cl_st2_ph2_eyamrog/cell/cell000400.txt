Title: Protective neutralizing antibodies from human survivors of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever


Abstract: Summary

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is a World Health Organization priority pathogen. CCHFV infections cause a highly lethal hemorrhagic fever for which specific treatments and vaccines are urgently needed. Here, we characterize the human immune response to natural CCHFV infection to identify potent neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (nAbs) targeting the viral glycoprotein. Competition experiments showed that these nAbs bind six distinct antigenic sites in the Gc subunit. These sites were further delineated through mutagenesis and mapped onto a prefusion model of Gc. Pairwise screening identified combinations of non-competing nAbs that afford synergistic neutralization. Further enhancements in neutralization breadth and potency were attained by physically linking variable domains of synergistic nAb pairs through bispecific antibody (bsAb) engineering. Although multiple nAbs protected mice from lethal CCHFV challenge in pre- or post-exposure prophylactic settings, only a single bsAb, DVD-121-801, afforded therapeutic protection. DVD-121-801 is a promising candidate suitable for clinical development as a CCHFV therapeutic.

Section: Introduction

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is a tick-borne virus in the family Nairoviridae (order Bunyavirales ) of segmented single-strand RNA viruses that can cause severe hemorrhagic disease in humans. Case fatality rates of 5%–30% are typically observed in CCHF outbreaks but have been reported to be as high as 80% ( Spengler et al., 2018 66. Spengler, J.R. ∙ Bente, D.A. ∙ Bray, M. ...

Carried mainly by ticks of the Hyalomma genus, CCHFV is the most prevalent tick-borne virus that causes human disease and is endemic in countries across Europe, Asia, and Africa ( Bente et al., 2013 6.

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever and expansion from endemic regions Curr. Opin. Virol. 2019; 34 :70-78 Crossref Scopus (88) PubMed Google Scholar ). Human infection typically results from the bite of an infected tick or contact with blood from infected livestock ( Bente et al., 2013 6. Bente, D.A. ∙ Forrester, N.L. ∙ Watts, D.M. ... Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever: history, epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical syndrome and genetic diversity Antiviral Res. 2013; 100 :159-189 Crossref Scopus (593) PubMed Google Scholar ), but nosocomial infection has also been reported ( Conger et al., 2015 18. Conger, N.G. ∙ Paolino, K.M. ∙ Osborn, E.C. ... Health care response to CCHF in US soldier and nosocomial transmission to health care providers, Germany, 2009 Emerg. Infect.

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever: prevention and control limitations in a resource-poor country Clin. Infect. Dis. 2004; 38 :1731-1735 Crossref Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar ). Despite the widespread geographic distribution of CCHFV and the severity of CCHF disease, no specific medical countermeasures are currently available; the broad-spectrum antiviral ribavirin is used off label in some regions, but evidence for its efficacy is controversial ( Johnson et al., 2018 42. Johnson, S. ∙ Henschke, N. ∙ Maayan, N. ... Ribavirin for treating Crimean Congo haemorrhagic fever Cochrane Database Syst. Rev. 2018; 6 :CD012713 PubMed Google Scholar ). In 2017, the World Health Organization declared CCHF a Blueprint Priority Disease ( Mehand et al., 2018 52. Mehand, M.S. ∙ Millett, P. ∙ Al-Shorbaji, F. ... World health organization methodology to prioritize emerging infectious diseases in need of research and development Emerg. Infect. Dis. 2018; 24 :e171427 Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar ).
CCHFV harbors a tripartite, negative-strand RNA genome with the nucleoprotein, glycoprotein precursor, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase encoded by the small (S), medium (M), and large (L) RNA segments, respectively. The glycoprotein precursor is co- and post-translationally processed to generate two structural glycoproteins, Gn and Gc, which mediate cell attachment and membrane fusion, as well as three secreted, putatively non-virion-associated (“nonstructural”) glycoproteins, GP38, GP85, and GP160 ( Zivcec et al., 2016 86.

Circulating strains of CCHFV have been classified into seven distinct clades based on phylogenetic comparison of their M segments ( Carroll et al., 2010 13. Carroll, S.A. ∙ Bird, B.H. ∙ Rollin, P.E. ... Ancient common ancestry of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus Mol. Phylogenet. Evol. 2010; 55 :1103-1110 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ), with most confirmed reports occurring in Turkey, where clade V strains predominate ( Bente et al., 2013 6. Bente, D.A. ∙ Forrester, N.L. ∙ Watts, D.M. ... Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever: history, epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical syndrome and genetic diversity Antiviral Res. 2013; 100 :159-189 Crossref Scopus (593) PubMed Google Scholar ; Spengler et al., 2018 66.

Previous work has shown that the lack of serum antibodies correlates with fatality in human CCHF patients, suggesting that antibodies may play a role in protection from lethal CCHFV infection ( Ergonul et al., 2006 30. Ergonul, O. ∙ Celikbas, A. ∙ Baykam, N. ... Analysis of risk-factors among patients with Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus infection: severity criteria revisited Clin. Microbiol.

Antibody response in Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever Rev. Infect. Dis. 1989; 11 :S801-S806 Crossref Scopus (117) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus far, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and neutralizing mAbs (nAbs) against CCHFV have only been isolated from immunized mice ( Bertolotti-Ciarlet et al., 2005 8. Bertolotti-Ciarlet, A. ∙ Smith, J. ∙ Strecker, K. ... Cellular localization and antigenic characterization of crimean-congo hemorrhagic fever virus glycoproteins J. Virol. 2005; 79 :6152-6161 Crossref Scopus (125) PubMed Google Scholar ). Three Gc-specific nAbs from this panel demonstrated cross-neutralizing activity against multiple strains ( Bertolotti-Ciarlet et al., 2005 8. Bertolotti-Ciarlet, A. ∙ Smith, J. ∙ Strecker, K. ...

GP38-targeting monoclonal antibodies protect adult mice against lethal Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus infection Sci. Adv. 2019; 5 :eaaw9535 Crossref Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar ). By contrast, mAbs targeting the Gn polyprotein precursor (pre-Gn) and/or GP38 lacked neutralizing activity, but a few nonetheless afforded protection in mice, especially when administered prior to viral challenge ( Bertolotti-Ciarlet et al., 2005 8. Bertolotti-Ciarlet, A. ∙ Smith, J. ∙ Strecker, K. ... Cellular localization and antigenic characterization of crimean-congo hemorrhagic fever virus glycoproteins J.

Together, these data indicate that existing recombinant mAbs may have utility against CCHFV but suggest that new mAbs with enhanced potency are needed.
Recent studies with other highly virulent and lethal viruses (e.g., Ebola virus) have shown that mAbs derived from survivors of natural infection can be effective as therapeutics, even when administered after the onset of severe disease ( Bornholdt et al., 2019 11.

Moreover, characterization of human mAbs targeting viral pathogens can illuminate specific targets for vaccine design and enhance outbreak preparedness ( Bloom et al., 2017 9.

A generalized HIV vaccine design strategy for priming of broadly neutralizing antibody responses Science. 2019; 366 :eaax4380 Crossref Scopus (127) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, we mined the B cell repertoires of four CCHF-convalescent donors to discover and characterize mAbs specific for the CCHFV Gn/Gc glycoproteins. We identified broadly neutralizing mAbs (bnAbs) that recognize distinct epitopes in Gc and could protect mice when administered prior to, or shortly after, a lethal dose of CCHFV (pre-exposure or post-exposure prophylaxis, respectively). However, neither these bnAbs nor GP38-specific mAbs from this and previous work afforded therapeutic protection when administered 24 h after viral challenge, either alone or in combination ( Bertolotti-Ciarlet et al., 2005 8. Bertolotti-Ciarlet, A. ∙ Smith, J. ∙ Strecker, K. ... Cellular localization and antigenic characterization of crimean-congo hemorrhagic fever virus glycoproteins J.

GP38-targeting monoclonal antibodies protect adult mice against lethal Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus infection Sci. Adv. 2019; 5 :eaaw9535 Crossref Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar ). To generate antibodies with enhanced antiviral potency, we engineered and evaluated bispecific antibodies (bsAbs) bearing variable domains from synergistic bnAbs and identified one bsAb that could provide therapeutic protection against CCHFV with a single dose. Our findings inform the development of broadly protective CCHF immunotherapeutics and the rational design of vaccines tailored to elicit highly potent bnAbs.

Section: Results

We collected blood samples from four CCHF-convalescent Ugandan donors between 2 and 46 months post-infection ( Table S1 ). To isolate glycoprotein-reactive B cells from peripheral blood, we designed a recombinant polyprotein bait (rGn/Gc) retaining the ectodomains of the polyprotein precursor but lacking the transmembrane domains and endodomains. Further, sequences corresponding to the mature Gn and Gc ectodomains were fused together with a flexible Gly-Ser linker ( Voss et al., 2010 73. Voss, J.E. ∙ Vaney, M.-C. ∙ Duquerroy, S. ... Glycoprotein organization of Chikungunya virus particles revealed by X-ray crystallography Nature. 2010; 468 :709-712 Crossref Scopus (504) PubMed Google Scholar ), and proteolytic cleavage between the GP38 and Gn domains was enhanced by replacement of the SKI-I/S1P-like cleavage site with that of the Golgi proprotein convertase furin ( Figure S1 A). Sera from the CCHF-convalescent donors and previously characterized murine mAbs targeting GP38 and Gc ( Bertolotti-Ciarlet et al., 2005 8. Bertolotti-Ciarlet, A. ∙ Smith, J. ∙ Strecker, K. ...

Virol. 2005; 79 :6152-6161 Crossref Scopus (125) PubMed Google Scholar ; Golden et al., 2019 34. Golden, J.W. ∙ Shoemaker, C.J. ∙ Lindquist, M.E. ... GP38-targeting monoclonal antibodies protect adult mice against lethal Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus infection Sci. Adv. 2019; 5 :eaaw9535 Crossref Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar ) bound to rGn/Gc ( Figures S1 B and S1C). Binding assays using anti-CCHFV mAbs that bind conformation-dependent epitopes ( Bertolotti-Ciarlet et al., 2005 8. Bertolotti-Ciarlet, A. ∙ Smith, J. ∙ Strecker, K. ... Cellular localization and antigenic characterization of crimean-congo hemorrhagic fever virus glycoproteins J. Virol. 2005; 79 :6152-6161 Crossref Scopus (125) PubMed Google Scholar ) suggest that this construct recapitulates conformational features of CCHFV Gc ( Figure S1 C). Surprisingly, despite cleavage of the rGn/Gc polyprotein to liberate the mucin-like and GP38 domains ( Figure S1 D), rGn/Gc was still recognized by the GP38-specific mAbs ( Figure S1 C). Consistent with this result, follow-up analysis of rGn/Gc by mass-spectrometry-based peptide mapping and intact mass analysis identified the presence of GP38 in purified preparations ( Figure S1 E). Incomplete furin cleavage and/or purification may explain the presence of GP38 in these samples. Alternatively, or in addition, it is conceivable that a non-covalent association between GP38 and Gn/Gc accounts for their co-purification in our rGn/Gc preparations. Indeed, GP38 was recently shown to be present on the envelopes of CCHFV-like particles ( Golden et al., 2019 34. Golden, J.W. ∙ Shoemaker, C.J. ∙ Lindquist, M.E. ... GP38-targeting monoclonal antibodies protect adult mice against lethal Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus infection Sci. Adv. 2019; 5 :eaaw9535 Crossref Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We evaluated the CCHFV-glycoprotein-specific memory B cell response in peripheral blood by fluorescently labeling B cell surface markers (CD19, CD20, immunoglobulin M [IgM], IgD, and CD27) and staining with rGn/Gc probes ( Figures 1 A and S1 F), which showed that 0.3%–1% of class-switched B cells (CD19/CD20 + IgM − IgD − ) were rGn/Gc reactive ( Figure 1 A). Approximately 450 (donor 1) or 180 (donors 5–7) rGn/Gc-reactive B cells were single-cell sorted for antibody cloning, sequencing, and production in an engineered strain of S. cerevisiae ( Bornholdt et al., 2016 10.

Methods. 2008; 329 :112-124 Crossref Scopus (769) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although we sorted all rGn/Gc-reactive B cells regardless of antibody isotype or CD27 surface expression, index sorting revealed that most (83%–98%) rGn/Gc-reactive mAbs derived from class-switched B cells ( Figures 1 B and S1 G). Approximately half of the isolated rGn/Gc-reactive B cells from donors 1 and 5 displayed low levels of CD27 surface expression ( Figures 1 B and S1 G), consistent with an increasing CD27 − resting memory B cell population in peripheral blood over time ( Andrews et al., 2019 2.

The median levels of somatic hypermutation (SHM) in the variable region of the heavy chain (5–10 nucleotide substitutions) are similar to those observed in antibodies induced by other primary viral infections or vaccination ( Bornholdt et al., 2016 10.

Longitudinal dynamics of the human B cell response to the yellow fever 17D vaccine Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2020; 117 :6675-6685 Crossref Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ). On average, SHM levels were higher in the mAbs cloned from donors who experienced longer intervals between infection and blood draw ( Figures 1 A and 1C; Table S1 ), suggesting that affinity maturation likely continues for several months following the period of active viral replication, as previously reported in the context of Ebola virus infection and yellow fever vaccination ( Davis et al., 2019 23. Davis, C.W. ∙ Jackson, K.J.L. ∙ McElroy, A.K. ...

USA. 2020; 117 :6675-6685 Crossref Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 1 C). Analysis of paired heavy- and light-chain sequences showed that the rGn/Gc-reactive B cells isolated from all four donors were clonally diverse, with only ∼0%–7% per donor belonging to expanded clonal lineages ( Figure 1 D). Altogether, we generated a panel of 361 rGn/Gc-reactive mAbs from four donors at different times post-infection and largely from clonally diverse, class-switched B cells.
To identify which component of rGn/Gc is targeted by each mAb, we first tested binding to IbAr10200-derived rGn/Gc and Gc antigens using biolayer interferometry. Most of the mAbs (>80%) reacted with both rGn/Gc and Gc ( Figures 2 A and 2D), indicating that they target epitopes in the Gc subunit. The mAbs that reacted with rGn/Gc, but not Gc, were further examined for their capacity to recognize recombinant Gn and GP38. Surprisingly, none reacted with either in-house or commercially produced rGn ( Figure S2 A). Instead, most of these mAbs bound rGP38 ( Figures 2 D and S2 A).
We next assessed mAb cross-reactivity by measuring binding with rGn/Gc antigens derived from IbAr10200, China (79121M18), and Kosova Hoti strains, representing clades III, I, and V, respectively ( Figures 2 B, 2C, and 2E). Concordant with the high degree of Gc sequence similarity among these strains (∼89%–95% identity; Figure S2 B), the majority of the Gc-specific mAbs recognized all three rGn/Gc antigens tested ( Figure 2 E). We also identified seven cross-reactive GP38-specific mAbs, six of which recognized the same conserved antigenic site on GP38 ( Figure S2 C). Further, five of these six cross-reactive, GP38-specific antibodies shared Vλ3-21 germline usage without being clonally related, suggesting convergent recognition of this antigenic site ( Figure S2 D). In summary, the majority of rGn/Gc-reactive antibodies isolated from CCHF-convalescent donors recognize conserved epitopes in Gc, with a smaller subset targeting sites in GP38.
To determine the number and frequency of mAbs targeting distinct antigenic sites within Gc, we used a previously described yeast-based assay to test the entire panel of rGn/Gc-reactive mAbs for competition with seven antigen-binding fragments (Fabs) that bind different epitopes in Gc (ADI-36121, ADI-36122, ADI-36124, ADI-36125, ADI-36136, and ADI-36193) and GP38 (ADI-36120) ( Figure S3 A; Gilman et al., 2016 33. Gilman, M.S.A. ∙ Castellanos, C.A. ∙ Chen, M. ... Rapid profiling of RSV antibody repertoires from the memory B cells of naturally infected adult donors Sci. Immunol. 2016; 1 :eaaj1879 Crossref Scopus (144) PubMed Google Scholar ). The majority of Gc-reactive mAbs from each donor could be assigned to one of six different competition groups ( Figure 3 ). For clarity, these competition groups were designated antigenic sites 1–6 according to frequency (site 1 > site 6) ( Figure 3 A–C). mAbs that competed with ADI-36125 (site 2) often also competed with ADI-36121, ADI-36122, or ADI-36193, suggesting that these epitopes are in close proximity. Accordingly, we designated these antigenic sites 2a–2d ( Figure 3 ).
To elucidate the location of the antigenic sites within Gc, the mAbs that defined each of the six antigenic sites in competitive binding assays were used for epitope mapping studies by employing mutagenized Gc libraries displayed on the surface of yeast ( Mata-Fink et al., 2013 51. Mata-Fink, J. ∙ Kriegsman, B. ∙ Yu, H.X. ... Rapid conformational epitope mapping of anti-gp120 antibodies with a designed mutant panel displayed on yeast J. Mol. Biol. 2013; 425 :444-456 Crossref Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the first and second rounds of fluorescence-activated cell sorting, mutants that lost binding to a particular antibody were isolated. In the third round of sorting, a mixture of antibodies targeting different antigenic sites were used for positive selection, thereby selecting mutants that did not disrupt the global conformation of Gc ( Figures 3 D and S4 A). After sequencing single clones, mutants with a single amino acid mutation were displayed on the surface of yeast and assayed for the binding of antibodies targeting all six antigenic sites to validate the identified mutations ( Figures 3 D, S4 B, and S4C). Comparison of binding relative to wild-type determined whether each antibody was sensitive to the isolated variants. In total, two to six positions were identified to be important for the specific binding of each antibody ( Figures 3 D and S4 B).
Current evidence indicates that the Gc subunits of orthobunyaviruses, phleboviruses, and orthohantaviruses are class II viral membrane fusion proteins structurally homologous to the fusion subunits of alphaviruses, rubiviruses, and flaviviruses ( DuBois et al., 2013 28.

Commun. 2019; 10 :879 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ), strongly suggesting that nairovirus Gc is also a class II fusion protein. Concordantly, we were able to generate a homology model based on the Gc subunit of the orthohantavirus, Maporal virus ( Figure 3 E). To identify the location of the antigenic sites on the structure of CCHFV Gc, we mapped the mutations onto this homology model. Site 1, which is targeted by approximately half (41%–62%) of the antibodies, encompasses the highly conserved fusion loops. Site 2a mAbs mapped to the fusion-loop-proximal region and display convergent sequence features suggestive of a public antibody response. Specifically, they are characterized by (1) the usage of similar germline genes, (2) relatively short CDRH3s, (3) elevated polyreactivity, and (4) similar somatic mutations both within and across donors ( Figures S3 B–S3G). The site 3 mAb ADI-36121 targets residues modeled as domain II. The mAbs targeting sites 4 and 5 mapped to domains II and I, respectively. Site 6 was the only antigenic site mapping to domain III, and binding of the site-6-targeting mAb ADI-36145 to recombinant domain III was verified by biolayer interferometry ( Figure S4 D).
We used transcription- and entry-competent virus-like particles (tecVLPs) to evaluate the neutralizing potential of CCHFV Gn/Gc-reactive mAbs under biosafety level 2 conditions. As previously described, tecVLPs contain all structural proteins of the authentic virus and a minigenome expressing a Nano-Glo luciferase reporter gene. They also recapitulate the behavior of authentic CCHFV in studies of cell entry and inhibition with small molecules and mAbs ( Zivcec et al., 2015 85. Zivcec, M. ∙ Metcalfe, M.G. ∙ Albariño, C.G. ... Assessment of Inhibitors of Pathogenic Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Virus Strains Using Virus-Like Particles PLoS Negl. Trop. Dis. 2015; 9 :e0004259 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ). To identify mAbs with neutralizing potential against a clinically relevant strain, we initially screened a single concentration of each mAb (35 nM) against tecVLPs bearing Oman Gn/Gc. This clade IV strain of CCHFV has been endemic in Oman for at least 20 years, and its incidence has been rising steadily ( Al-Abri et al., 2019 1. Al-Abri, S.S. ∙ Hewson, R. ∙ Al-Kindi, H. ... Clinical and molecular epidemiology of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever in Oman PLoS Negl. Trop. Dis. 2019; 13 :e0007100 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our screens revealed a broad range of neutralizing activity among mAbs derived from each donor. We prioritized potent nAbs, affording reductions of tecVLP reporter activity >90%, for further analysis ( Figure 4 A). A breakdown of nAb potency by targeted antigenic site showed that potent neutralization could be achieved by binding some, but not all, antigenic sites in Gc. Among these, fusion-loop-targeting (site 1) and domain-II-targeting (site 3) nAbs displayed the highest median potencies (∼70%–80% neutralization), with the most potent nAbs belonging to the latter group ( Figure 4 B). None of the GP38-specific mAbs afforded potent neutralization, consistent with previous reports ( Figure 4 B; Golden et al., 2019 34. Golden, J.W. ∙ Shoemaker, C.J. ∙ Lindquist, M.E. ... GP38-targeting monoclonal antibodies protect adult mice against lethal Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus infection Sci.

A challenge to the development of broadly protective immunotherapeutics against CCHF is the existence of multiple, geographically distinct viral clades with divergent Gn/Gc sequences ( Figure S2 B). Strains responsible for the majority of CCHF cases in humans belong to clades III, IV, and V ( Bente et al., 2013 6. Bente, D.A. ∙ Forrester, N.L. ∙ Watts, D.M. ...

Accordingly, we examined the capacity of selected nAbs targeting five different antigenic sites to neutralize not only Oman tecVLPs (clade IV) but also tecVLPs bearing Gn/Gc proteins from the prototypic clade III CCHFV strain IbAr10200 and the virulent clade V strains Turkey and Kosova Hoti. Most of the nAbs potently neutralized IbAr10200 tecVLPs, with IC 50 (nAb concentration at half-maximal inhibition of viral infection) values in the sub-nanomolar or single-digit-nanomolar range. Largely similar results were observed against Oman tecVLPs, with the exception that nAbs targeting site 2a (adjacent to the fusion loops) displayed lower activity against this strain ( Figures 4 and S5 ). Most nAbs targeting sites 1, 3, and 6 retained broad neutralizing activity against the clade V tecVLPs (Kosova Hoti and Turkey), albeit with somewhat reduced potency ( Figures 4 C–4F). The site 3 nAb ADI-36121 was especially noteworthy in its capacity to neutralize Kosova Hoti tecVLPs with sub-nanomolar potency. Based on these findings, we down-selected to three nAbs, ADI-37801 (site 1/fusion loops), ADI-36121 (site 3/domain II), and ADI-36145 (site 6/domain III). The same set of nAbs was active against authentic CCHFV IbAr10200, with potencies equivalent to or surpassing those observed against tecVLPs ( Figure 4 G).
Although antiviral monotherapies have demonstrated clinical efficacy ( Mulangu et al., 2019 56.

To mitigate this risk and identify nAb cocktails with enhanced efficacy and/or breadth, we next explored the synergistic potential of our lead nAbs. Specifically, we measured the activities of equimolar mixtures of noncompeting nAb pairs relative to those of the individual nAbs and performed combination index (CI) analysis of the resulting neutralization curves using the well-established method of Chou and Talalay ( Chou and Talalay, 1984 17.

Virol. 2001; 75 :12198-12208 Crossref Scopus (142) PubMed Google Scholar ). ADI-36121 (site 3/domain II) and ADI-36145 (site 6/domain III) lacked synergistic activity (CI ≥ 1) against Oman tecVLPs ( Figures 5 A and 5D). In contrast, combinations of ADI-37801 (site 1/fusion loops) with either ADI-36121 or ADI-36145 synergistically neutralized Oman tecVLPs (CI < 1) over a broad range of nAb concentrations ( Figures 5 B, 5C, 5E, and 5F). Similar results were observed with IbAr10200, Turkey, and Kosova Hoti tecVLPs, although the effect was smaller for IbAr10200 than for the other strains ( Figure 5 G). Synergistic neutralization also extended to other nAbs targeting site 1, indicating that it is a general property of Gc fusion-loop binders and not specific to ADI-37801 ( Figure S6 ).
We evaluated the prophylactic and therapeutic potential of our lead nAbs and nAb combinations in two distinct immunocompromised rodent models of lethal CCHFV challenge. First, we benchmarked the prophylactic efficacy of ADI-36121, ADI-36145, and ADI-37801 against a chimerized version of the previously described GP38-specific mouse mAb 13G8 (c13G8) ( Mishra et al., 2020 55. Mishra, A.K. ∙ Moyer, C.L. ∙ Abelson, D.M. ... Structure and Characterization of Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Virus GP38 J. Virol. 2020; 94 :e02005-19 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ). We treated type I interferon α/β R −/− (IFNAR1-KO) mice ( Bereczky et al., 2010 7. Bereczky, S. ∙ Lindegren, G. ∙ Karlberg, H. ... Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus infection is lethal for adult type I interferon receptor-knockout mice J. Gen.

Dis. 2013; 207 :1909-1921 Crossref Scopus (98) PubMed Google Scholar ) with 1 mg of each mAb per animal (∼50 mg/kg), as well as with combinations of the Gc-specific nAbs that afforded synergistic neutralization 24 h prior to challenge with CCHFV-IbAr10200. Essentially complete protection was observed with all mAbs and mAb combinations tested ( Figure 6 A), with associated prevention of weight loss ( Figure 6 B). ADI-36121 and ADI-36145 also protected STAT1 −/− (STAT1-KO) mice ( Bente et al., 2010 5. Bente, D.A. ∙ Alimonti, J.B. ∙ Shieh, W.-J. ...

Expression of interferon-induced antiviral genes is delayed in a STAT1 knockout mouse model of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever Virol. J. 2012; 9 :122 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ) against CCHFV-Turkey challenge when administered at 30 min post-exposure ( Figures 6 C and 6D), as shown previously for c13G8 ( Mishra et al., 2020 55. Mishra, A.K. ∙ Moyer, C.L. ∙ Abelson, D.M. ... Structure and Characterization of Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Virus GP38 J. Virol. 2020; 94 :e02005-19 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Having demonstrated pre-exposure and post-exposure prophylactic protection, we next tested the same set of mAbs in a therapeutic setting (24 h post-challenge). Neither individual Gc-specific nAbs nor their combinations afforded measurable protection against CCHFV-IbAr10200 when dosed at 0.5 mg ( Figures 6 E and 6F) or 1 mg ( Figures 6 G and 6H) per animal (25 or 50 mg/kg, respectively). Further, although two 1-mg doses of 13G8 administered at days 1 and 4 post-challenge afforded partial protection in the same murine model ( Golden et al., 2019 34. Golden, J.W. ∙ Shoemaker, C.J. ∙ Lindquist, M.E. ... GP38-targeting monoclonal antibodies protect adult mice against lethal Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus infection Sci. Adv. 2019; 5 :eaaw9535 Crossref Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar ), we observed no significant protection with single doses of c13G8 ( Figures 6 E–6H). Taken together, these findings indicate that human nAbs targeting CCHFV Gc can be at least as efficacious as non-neutralizing mAbs targeting GP38 in prophylactic and pre-exposure settings. However, we also show that single doses of currently available mAbs cannot protect against CCHFV challenge in a therapeutic setting, at least in the highly stringent rodent models presently in use.
We postulated that the synergistic activity of our most potent nAb pairs (ADI-36121 + ADI-37801 and ADI-36145 + ADI-37801) could be further amplified through avidity effects by physically linking their corresponding variable domains into bsAbs ( Wec et al., 2016 77. Wec, A.Z. ∙ Nyakatura, E.K. ∙ Herbert, A.S. ... A “Trojan horse” bispecific-antibody strategy for broad protection against ebolaviruses Science. 2016; 354 :350-354 Crossref Scopus (95) PubMed Google Scholar ). Accordingly, we engineered four dual-variable-domain Igs (DVD-Igs) to bear these pairs of variable domains in both possible configurations (i.e., as “inner” or “outer” variable domains) ( Figure 7 A). The DVD-Igs were purified from ExpiCHO cells, and size-exclusion chromatography indicated the preparations were largely monodisperse and of expected molecular weights ( Figures S7 A–S7D). The capacity of both combining sites in each DVD-Ig to recognize rGn/Gc was confirmed by biolayer interferometry through two-phase experiments in which binding to rGn/Gc in the presence of the respective parental monospecific mAbs was assayed. The DVD-Igs were able to bind rGn/Gc in the presence of each monospecific mAb ( Figures S7 E–S7H), but not in the presence of both mAbs ( Figures S7 I and S7J), indicating that both sets of variable domains recognized their expected epitopes. In neutralization studies, DVD-121-801 was more potent than the equimolar mixture of its parental nAbs against all four tecVLP preparations bearing divergent Gn/Gc proteins ( Figures 7 B–7E). DVD-145-801 also exhibited enhanced potency, but only against Oman and Kosova Hoti tecVLPs; it resembled the mixture of its parental nAbs in its activity against IbAr10200 and Turkey tecVLPs ( Figures 7 F–7I). Interestingly, the relative positions of the two sets of variable domains in these two DVD-Igs was crucial to their enhanced activity; neither of their counterparts bearing the same variable domains in the reverse configuration (DVD-801-121 and DVD-801-145; Figure 7 A) afforded enhanced neutralization against Oman tecVLPs ( Figures 7 B and 7F).
Finally, we sought to test if the enhanced in vitro activity of DVD-121-801 and DVD-145-801 would translate to improved therapeutic efficacy in vivo . To this end, we challenged IFNAR1-KO mice with CCHFV-IbAr10200 and then treated animals with molecular weight-adjusted amounts of DVD-121-801 and DVD-145-801 (to be equimolar to 1 mg of monospecific mAb) as part of the study described above ( Figures 6 G and 6H) that also included nAb and nAb-combination arms. Strikingly, DVD-121-801 afforded essentially complete protection, whereas DVD-145-801 provided no benefit ( Figures 7 J and 7K). This result was concordant with the enhanced neutralizing activity of the former bsAb, but not the latter, against IbAr10200 tecVLPs ( Figures 7 C and 7G). We thus identified a single bsAb that combines two synergizing bnAbs that target distinct sites in Gc domain II to achieve 10- to 100-fold enhanced neutralization potency relative to its component nAbs. A single dose of this bsAb afforded therapeutic protection in a stringent model of lethal CCHFV infection.

Section: Discussion

Previous work suggests that mAb-based treatments can help fulfill the urgent and currently unmet need for medical countermeasures against CCHF disease in humans. mAbs recognizing the CCHFV glycoproteins pre-Gn/GP38 and Gc have been isolated previously through experimental vaccination of mice ( Bertolotti-Ciarlet et al., 2005 8. Bertolotti-Ciarlet, A. ∙ Smith, J. ∙ Strecker, K. ... Cellular localization and antigenic characterization of crimean-congo hemorrhagic fever virus glycoproteins J. Virol. 2005; 79 :6152-6161 Crossref Scopus (125) PubMed Google Scholar ). These studies also found that although mAbs targeting Gc could neutralize viral infection, only non-neutralizing mAbs targeting GP38 could confer protection in mouse models of CCHFV challenge through an unknown mechanism ( Bertolotti-Ciarlet et al., 2005 8. Bertolotti-Ciarlet, A. ∙ Smith, J. ∙ Strecker, K. ... Cellular localization and antigenic characterization of crimean-congo hemorrhagic fever virus glycoproteins J. Virol. 2005; 79 :6152-6161 Crossref Scopus (125) PubMed Google Scholar ; Golden et al., 2019 34. Golden, J.W. ∙ Shoemaker, C.J. ∙ Lindquist, M.E. ... GP38-targeting monoclonal antibodies protect adult mice against lethal Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus infection Sci. Adv. 2019; 5 :eaaw9535 Crossref Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because GP38 sequences are more divergent among different CCHFV clades than those of the Gn/Gc glycoprotein complex, it is unclear if GP38-targeting mAbs can form the sole basis of broadly protective CCHF therapeutics. As a case in point, mAb 13G8 lacked cross-protective activity against relatively closely related viral strains ( Golden et al., 2019 34. Golden, J.W. ∙ Shoemaker, C.J. ∙ Lindquist, M.E. ... GP38-targeting monoclonal antibodies protect adult mice against lethal Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus infection Sci. Adv. 2019; 5 :eaaw9535 Crossref Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar ). Herein, we characterized the human memory B cell response to natural infection in CCHF survivors from Uganda and described fully human nAbs that can target Gn/Gc from a geographically diverse set of CCHFV isolates. We identified synergistic combinations of Gc-specific nAbs and demonstrated that a single dose of a bsAb incorporating one such combination could afford therapeutic protection against lethal CCHFV infection.
Our analysis of 361 mAbs isolated from rGn/Gc-specific human memory B cells identified high-affinity binders to Gc or GP38 but none that could be explicitly mapped to Gn. For some Bunyavirales members, such as phleboviruses, Gn has been suggested as the main nAb target ( Hao et al., 2020 38. Hao, M. ∙ Zhang, G. ∙ Zhang, S. ...

Wang, Q. ∙ Ma, T. ∙ Wu, Y. ... Neutralization mechanism of human monoclonal antibodies against Rift Valley fever virus Nat. Microbiol. 2019; 4 :1231-1241 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ), whereas for others, such as orthohantaviruses, both Gn and Gc were found to be targeted ( Duehr et al., 2020 29. Duehr, J. ∙ McMahon, M. ∙ Williamson, B. ...

Rissanen, I. ∙ Stass, R. ∙ Krumm, S.A. ... Molecular rationale for hantavirus neutralization by a reservoir host-derived monoclonal antibody bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). By contrast, immunization with recombinant ectodomain forms of CCHFV Gc, but not Gn, induced robust nAbs in mice ( Kortekaas et al., 2015 45. Kortekaas, J. ∙ Vloet, R.P.M. ∙ McAuley, A.J. ... Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Virus Subunit Vaccines Induce High Levels of Neutralizing Antibodies But No Protection in STAT1 Knockout Mice Vector Borne Zoonotic Dis. 2015; 15 :759-764 Crossref Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ). We speculate that our failure to isolate CCHFV Gn-specific mAbs and their paucity in the literature reflect the topological arrangement of these subunits on the viral particle and the attendant immunodominance of Gc over Gn. Thus, the nairovirus Gn/Gc complex may more closely resemble its orthobunyavirus counterpart in quaternary organization (Gc≫Gn in surface exposure) than it does the phlebovirus or orthohantavirus Gn/Gc complexes ( Hellert et al., 2019 39.

The hantavirus surface glycoprotein lattice and its fusion control mechanism Cell. 2020; 183 :442-456.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ). Alternatively, it is conceivable that the Gn component of our rGn/Gc probe is occluded or improperly folded and/or that there are significant differences in antigenicity between IbAr10200 Gn and the unknown infecting strain(s) ( Figure S2 B). Unfortunately, no validated Gn-specific reagents, including conformation-sensitive control antibodies, are currently available to evaluate these hypotheses.
Our epitope-binning studies uncovered six distinct antigenic sites in Gc that we fine-mapped by mutagenesis ( Figure 3 D). Strikingly, mapping of the antigenic sites onto a homology-based structural model of Gc ( Figure 3 E), showed that site 1, corresponding to the Gc fusion loops, represented ∼50% of mAbs isolated from each donor, indicating that its targeting is a shared immunological solution in humans. This apparent immunodominance of the fusion loops is concordant with similar observations for some flavivirus E proteins ( Beltramello et al., 2010 4. Beltramello, M. ∙ Williams, K.L. ∙ Simmons, C.P. ...

USA. 2020; 117 :6675-6685 Crossref Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ). Site 1 mAbs afforded neutralization with moderate-to-high potency and breadth; however, they typically failed to fully neutralize tecVLP entry. Quaternary Gn/Gc interactions in the viral envelope that partially and/or transiently occlude the fusion loops and render them unavailable for mAb binding may account for this un-neutralized fraction. Interestingly, similar nAb potencies against Gn/Gc from different CCHFV strains could be accompanied by quantitative differences in un-neutralized fraction (compare ADI-37801 curves in Figures 7 B and 7F versus Figures 7 C and 7G), raising the possibility that sequence-dependent differences in Gn/Gc organization and/or structural dynamics exist.

In contrast to DENV, however, for which cross-reactive fusion-loop-targeting mAbs generally lack neutralizing activity and can promote enhancement of infection ( Dejnirattisai et al., 2010 25. Dejnirattisai, W. ∙ Jumnainsong, A. ∙ Onsirisakul, N. ... Cross-reacting antibodies enhance dengue virus infection in humans Science. 2010; 328 :745-748 Crossref Scopus (726) PubMed Google Scholar ), we found that the fusion-loop-directed mAbs elicited by natural CCHFV infection possess both neutralizing activity and some degree of neutralization breadth. In the case of DENV, this has fueled efforts to design glycoprotein-based immunogens that can steer the antibody response away from the immunodominant fusion loops ( Rouvinski et al., 2017 61. Rouvinski, A. ∙ Dejnirattisai, W. ∙ Guardado-Calvo, P. ... Covalently linked dengue virus envelope glycoprotein dimers reduce exposure of the immunodominant fusion loop epitope Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :15411 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our work suggests instead that CCHFV vaccines may benefit from targeting the fusion loops together with other conserved sites in Gc domains II and III, such as sites 3 and 6, that afford potent neutralization ( Figure 4 C) and can synergize with the site I/fusion-loop binders ( Figures 5 B, 5C, 5E, and 5F). We anticipate that the structural elucidation of CCHFV Gn/Gc in its apo and antibody-bound forms will enhance our understanding of the mechanistic basis of neutralization mediated by mAbs recognizing specific antigenic sites and inform the development of next-generation vaccines that elicit antibodies to these sites.
To enhance neutralization potency and breadth and mitigate the risk of viral mutational escape ( Gilchuk et al., 2020 32. Gilchuk, P. ∙ Murin, C.D. ∙ Milligan, J.C. ...

Only combinations of site 3/domain II or site 6/domain III binders with site 1/fusion-loop binders afforded synergistic neutralization, characterized by Chou-Talalay CI scores < 1 and improvements in both neutralization IC 50 and un-neutralized fraction. The site specificity of nAb synergy suggested that it did not arise solely from the simultaneous engagement of two nonoverlapping functional epitopes ( Diamant et al., 2015 26. Diamant, E. ∙ Torgeman, A. ∙ Ozeri, E. ... Monoclonal Antibody Combinations that Present Synergistic Neutralizing Activity: A Platform for Next-Generation Anti-Toxin Drugs Toxins (Basel). 2015; 7 :1854-1881 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ). Instead, we speculate that these synergies reflect cooperative binding. Specifically, the site 3 and site 6 nAbs may trap “open” Gc conformers in which the fusion loops are more exposed for recognition by site 1 nAbs. The further improvements in neutralization IC 50 with bsAbs may reflect increases in binding avidity of the physically linked variable domains to these pairs of sites, which may be further magnified by the tetravalent DVD format used herein ( Diamant et al., 2015 26. Diamant, E. ∙ Torgeman, A. ∙ Ozeri, E. ... Monoclonal Antibody Combinations that Present Synergistic Neutralizing Activity: A Platform for Next-Generation Anti-Toxin Drugs Toxins (Basel). 2015; 7 :1854-1881 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ; Jakob et al., 2013 41.

A “Trojan horse” bispecific-antibody strategy for broad protection against ebolaviruses Science. 2016; 354 :350-354 Crossref Scopus (95) PubMed Google Scholar ). The reduced potency of the alternate DVD-Ig configurations bearing the fusion-loop-binding domains as outer domains (DVD-801-121 and DVD-801-145) presumably reflects structural constraints that reduce the efficiency of bivalent and/or tetravalent bsAb engagement with Gc. An understanding of these constraints awaits structural elucidation of the supramolecular organization of CCHFV Gn/Gc in intact viral particles.
Single doses of candidate nAbs targeting Gc domains II and III afforded prophylactic protection against virulent CCHFV strains from two distinct viral clades. That these studies were independently performed in two BSL-4 laboratories using genetically distinct immunocompromised murine models attests to the robustness of our findings. However, single doses of all tested nAbs, synergistic nAb combinations, and non-neutralizing GP38-specific mAbs failed to protect mice in a more stringent therapeutic setting. Strikingly, a single bsAb, DVD-121-801, combining variable domains from the synergizing nAbs ADI-36121 (site 3/domain II) and ADI-37801 (site 1/fusion loops), protected mice when administered 24 h post-viral challenge, concordant with its enhanced neutralization potency against tecVLPs bearing Gn/Gc from the cognate challenge strain. DVD-121-801 is thus an antibody-based treatment demonstrated to afford therapeutic protection against lethal CCHFV challenge with a single dose, and it is a lead candidate for further evaluation in murine and nonhuman primate models of CCHFV challenge ( Cross et al., 2020 22. Cross, R.W. ∙ Prasad, A.N. ∙ Borisevich, V. ... Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus strains Hoti and Afghanistan cause viremia and mild clinical disease in cynomolgus monkeys PLoS Negl. Trop.

A cynomolgus macaque model for Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever Nat. Microbiol. 2018; 3 :556-562 Crossref Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar ).
In this study, potent and protective antibodies targeting CCHFV Gc were generated and characterized. However, due to the nature of the human antibody response to natural CCHFV infection and/or the properties of the sorting antigen used, no antibodies targeting Gn were identified. The characteristics of such antibodies therefore remain largely unknown.
Our understanding of the interactions between mAbs or DVDs and CCHFV Gc is currently limited by a lack of structural information regarding Gn/Gc and their supramolecular organization on the surface of viral particles. Structural studies of this kind will greatly advance our understanding of the mechanistic underpinnings of neutralization and will aid in the precise mapping of antigenic sites.
Finally, while stringent immunocompromised rodent models of CCHFV infection are useful in down-selection of mAbs, studies in larger animal models that more faithfully recapitulate human CCHF are needed to advance a lead candidate for therapeutic use in humans.

Animals were provided food and water ad libitum and housed in individual ventilated cages.
Murine challenge studies were conducted under IACUC-approved protocols in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act, PHS Policy, and other applicable federal statutes and regulations relating to animals and experiments involving animals. The facilities where these studies were conducted (USAMRIID and UTMB) are accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care, International (AAALAC), and adhere to principles stated in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, National Research Council, 2013. Euthanasia criteria were defined as follows: mouse displays severely hunched posture, inability or reluctance to move, appears weak (staggering when moving around cage), or has labored breathing.
CCHF convalescent donors were recruited through the Uganda Virus Research Institute, Entebbe, Uganda. All donors had documented clinical history of CCHF infection in Agago and Nakaseke districts, Uganda, ranging from 2013 to 2017. The study was approved by the Helsinki committees of Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI), Entebbe, Uganda (reference number GC/127/13/01/15); Soroka Hospital, Beer Sheva, Israel (protocol number 0263-13-SOR); and the Ugandan National Council for Science and Technology (UNCST) (registration number HS1332). Written informed consent, as well as a personal health questionnaire, was completed for each donor who participated in this study. Study participants were adults, or minors with parental consent, and were not related. We confirm that all experiments were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations.
A construct containing CCHFV strain IbAr10200 GPC residues 1 to 1579 with an internal deletion of residues 691-1040 replaced with a 29-amino acid glycine/serine linker, fusing Gn to Gc was expressed in stably transfected Schneider 2 (S2) insect cells. The N-terminal MLD (GPC residues 1 to 247) was cleaved at the native furin cleavage site (GPC residues 244 to 247), and GP38 was also cleaved via an introduced furin cleavage site, replacing the native SKI-1 site (residues 516 to 519). The resulting Gn/Gc fusion protein was secreted and harvested from clarified S2 culture supernatant via a C-terminal double strep-tag II sequence using affinity chromatography (5 mL StrepTrap HP column, Cytiva) using phosphate buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with 150 mM NaCl and eluted using the same buffer with 2.5 mM desthiobiotin. The Gn/Gc protein was then purified by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) using an S200 column (Cytiva) in PBS supplemented with 150 mM NaCl.
A construct containing CCHFV strain IbAr10200 GPC residues 1 to 690 was expressed in stably transfected Schneider 2 (S2) insect cells. The N-terminal MLD (GPC residues 1–247) was cleaved at the native furin cleavage site (GPC residues 244–247), and GP38 was also cleaved from Gn via an introduced furin cleavage site, replacing the native SKI-1 site (residues 521–524). The resulting Gn protein was secreted and harvested from clarified S2 culture supernatant via a C-terminal double strep-tag II sequence using affinity chromatography (5 mL StrepTrap HP column, Cytiva) using phosphate buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with 150 mM NaCl and eluted using the same buffer with 2.5 mM desthiobiotin.
A construct containing CCHFV strain IbAr10200 GPC residues 1–1579 with an internal deletion of residues 520–1039, fusing Gc directly to the MLD and GP38 was expressed in stably transfected Schneider 2 (S2) insect cells. The N-terminal MLD (GPC residues 1–247) was cleaved at the native furin cleavage site (GPC residues 244–247), and GP38 was also cleaved from Gn via an introduced furin cleavage site at the C terminus of GP38 (residue 519) prior to the Gc sequence. The resulting Gc protein was secreted and harvested from clarified S2 culture supernatant via a C-terminal double strep-tag II sequence using affinity chromatography (5 mL StrepTrap HP column, Cytiva) using phosphate buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with 150 mM NaCl and eluted using the same buffer with 2.5 mM desthiobiotin.
GP38 was expressed in stably transfected Schneider 2 (S2) insect cells and the protein construct consisted of GPC residues 1–519 of CCHFV strain IbAr10200. The N-terminal MLD (GPC residues 1–247) was cleaved at the native furin cleavage site (GPC residues 244–247), and secreted GP38 was purified from clarified supernatant via streptavidin affinity chromatography utilizing a double C-terminal Strep-tag-II sequence and eluted into phosphate buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with 2.5mM desthiobiotin followed by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) into PBS.
For experiments detailed below using biotinylated rGn/Gc or GP38, the proteins were biotinylated with EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC Biotin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 14–16 h at 4°C followed by desalting using a Zeba spin column (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Amino acid sequences of the IbAr10200, China-79121M18, and Kosova Hoti strain GPCs used to generate recombinant CCHFV glycoproteins were derived from GenBank M-segment sequences with accession numbers NC_005300 , GU477493 , and ABW04159 respectively.
rGn/Gc serum reactivity ELISAs were performed in Greiner high-binding half-area plates. Individual wells were coated with 250 ng of purified, recombinant Gn/Gc diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4). Wells were washed three times with PBS supplemented with 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) and then blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS. Five-fold serial dilutions of CCHF patient serum, control serum, or PBS were then added to the blocked wells, followed by incubation for 1 h at ambient temperature. Samples were prepared in duplicate. After 3 washes with PBST, bound rGn/Gc-specific antibody was detected with an anti-human Fc secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP). KPL SureBlue TMB microwell peroxidase was used as the HRP substrate, and the reaction was stopped with an equal volume of 1M sulfuric acid. The absorbance at 450 nm was measured with a Perkin Elmer EnVision multimode plate reader.
Following affinity purification, IbAr10200 rGn/Gc was analyzed by SEC using an S200 10/300GL column as described above. The two major peaks resolved by gel filtration were collected separately and analyzed on a 4%–20% Biorad mini-PROTEAN TGX Stain-free SDS-PAGE gel (BioRad, Cat#4568096). For sample preparation, 2.5 μg of protein was diluted with 2x Laemmeli Sample Buffer (BioRad, Cat#1610737) to a final concentration of 1x and either loaded directly, or reduced with 10 mM DTT and boiled prior to loading. The gel was run at 200V for 30 min, then imaged directly with a BioRad ChemiDoc MP imager.
Gn/Gc protein was buffer-exchanged with 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) using 3 kDa MWCO spin filter (Amicon Ultra, Millipore) to remove the desthiobiotin buffer. N-deglycosylation was performed by adding PNGaseF Prime (N-Zyme Scientifics) to the sample and incubating overnight at 37°C. The deglycosylated rGn/Gc was desalted offline using C4 Ziptip (Millipore) and analyzed by MALDI-TOF in the positive linear mode using UltrafleXtreme MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker).
The rGn/Gc sample was buffer-exchanged with 50 mM NH 4 HCO 3 using 3 kDa MWCO spin filter (Amicon Ultra, Millipore) to remove the desthiobiotin buffer. The sample was then dried down by vacuum centrifugation and then re-suspended in 8 M Urea/ 5 mM DTT and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. This was followed by alkylation with 20 mM iodoacetamide in 50 mM NH 4 HCO 3 for 30 min in the dark at room temperature. The sample was diluted with 50 mM NH 4 HCO 3 down to 1.4 M urea final concentration and digested with Trypsin Gold (Promega) overnight at 37°C. The peptide digests were desalted using C18 HLB Oasis resin (Waters) and analyzed by nanoLC-ESI-MS/MS using a nanoRSLC UPLC system (Dionex, Thermo Scientific) equipped with a C-18 reverse phase column connected to an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). Protein identification was performed by automated protein database search using Proteome Discoverer v 2.4 (Thermo Scientific) against the rGn/Gc protein sequence. Identified spectra were filtered for < 1% false discovery rate.
IbAr10200 rGn/Gc streptamers were generated by complexing IbAr10200 rGn/Gc with Strep-Tactin PE (IBA Lifesciences) or Strep-Tactin APC (IBA Lifesciences) (1.4 μg rGn/Gc, 1.65 μL streptactin, PBS to a total of 20 uL) for at least 20 min on ice and in the dark prior to staining. Amounts were calculated such that upon diluting the streptamers in the staining solution, the B cells were stained with 25 nM of each protein/fluorophore combination. PBMCs from CCHFV convalescent donors or a healthy donor control were stained with PerCP-Cy5.5 labeled anti-human CD3 (BioLegend), CD8 (BioLegend), CD14 (Invitrogen), CD16 (BioLegend), PE-Cy7 labeled anti-human CD19 and CD20 (BioLegend), and 25 nM PE and APC streptamers and incubated for 1 hour on ice in the dark. PBMCs were additionally stained with AF488 labeled anti-human IgM (BioLegend), BV421 labeled anti-human IgD (BioLegend), BV510 labeled anti-human CD27 (BioLegend), and propidium iodide (Sigma) and incubated for 30 min on ice in the dark. The PBMCs were loaded onto a BD FACS Fusion (BD Biosciences) for analysis and sorting. Total rGn/Gc-specific B cells (CD19/CD20 + cells) were single cell sorted into 96-well tissue culture plates containing 20 μL per well of lysis buffer [5 μL of 5X first strand cDNA buffer (Invitrogen), 0.625 μL of NP-40 (Thermo Scientific), 0.25 μL RNaseOUT (Invitrogen), 1.25 μL 0.1M dithiothreitol (Invitrogen), and 12.875 μL dH2O]. Plates were briefly centrifuged before storage at −80°C.
Antibody variable genes were amplified based on previously described methods ( Tiller et al., 2008 72. Tiller, T. ∙ Meffre, E. ∙ Yurasov, S. ... Efficient generation of monoclonal antibodies from single human B cells by single cell RT-PCR and expression vector cloning J. Immunol. Methods. 2008; 329 :112-124 Crossref Scopus (769) PubMed Google Scholar ). IgH, Igκ, and Igλ variable genes were reverse transcribed (Superscirpt III, Thermo Fisher) prior to two rounds of PCR using a mixture of IgG-, IgA-, and IgM-specific primers and HotStarTaq Plus polymerase (QIAGEN). The primers in the second round of PCR contain homologous ends to a digested expression plasmid for cloning by homologous recombination in an engineered strain of S. cerevisiae using the lithium acetate chemical transformation method ( Gietz and Woods, 2006 31. Gietz, R.D. ∙ Woods, R.A. Yeast transformation by the LiAc/SS Carrier DNA/PEG method Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 313 :107-120 PubMed Google Scholar ). A combination of 10 μL of unpurified variable heavy chain PCR product, 10 μL of unpurified variable light chain PCR product, and 200 ng of digested plasmid were used for transformation into 10 7 yeast cells by resuspending the cells in a mixture of polyethylene glycol 3350 (240 uL, 50% w/v, Sigma), lithium acetate (36 uL, 1M, Sigma), boiled salmon sperm DNA (10 uL, Invitrogen), water (67 uL), and the unpurified PCR products and digested plasmids. After transformation and plating, single yeast colonies were picked for sequencing and IgG production.
mAbs used in biolayer interferometry assays and neutralization studies were produced as soluble, full-length IgG 1 in S. cerevisiae as previously detailed ( Wec et al., 2020b 80. Wec, A.Z. ∙ Wrapp, D. ∙ Herbert, A.S. ... Broad neutralization of SARS-related viruses by human monoclonal antibodies Science. 2020; 369 :731-736 Crossref Scopus (382) PubMed Google Scholar ). Supernatant was harvested by centrifugation and IgG was purified by Protein A-affinity chromatography. IgG bound to Protein A agarose was eluted with 200 mM acetic acid / 50 mM NaCl (pH 3.5) into 1/8th volume 2M HEPES buffer (pH 8.0) and subsequently buffer-exchanged into PBS (pH 7.0). Fab fragments used for competition assays were generated from full-length IgG by 2 h of papain digestion, which was terminated by iodoacetamide addition. Fab was purified from the mixture by passing the solution over Protein A agarose to remove molecules with intact Fc, followed by purification using CaptureSelect IgG-CH1 affinity resin (Thermo Fisher). The Fab fragments were eluted with 200 mM acetic acid / 50 mM NaCl (pH 3.5) into 1/8th volume 2M HEPES (pH 8.0) and buffer-exchanged into PBS (pH 7.0).
Murine antibodies 13G8, 5A5, 6B12, 10E11, 7F5, 8F10, 11F6, 12A9, 30F7, 13G5, 1H6, 3E3, and 11E7 were obtained from BEI Resources. c13G8 (chimeric 13G8 with human constant regions) as well as Gc-targeting mAbs and DVDs used for animal challenges were constructed and purified at Mapp Biopharmaceutical. Antibodies were expressed transiently in ExpiCHO cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and purified from cell supernatants using a GE MabSelect SuRe LX protein A affinity chromatography column on an AKTA pure fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) system. The antibodies were eluted using a glycine elution buffer at pH 2.2 and neutralized with 2M Tris base to a pH of ∼7.
Biolayer interferometry (BLI) kinetic measurements were acquired at 25°C with a ForteBio Octet HTX instrument (Sartorius) using Phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% BSA (PBSF). For binding analyses to rGn/Gc, IgG (100 nM in PBSF) were captured with anti-human IgG Fc capture (AHC) sensors (Sartorius). For binding experiments with Gc, IgG (100 nM in PBSF) were captured with with Protein A (ProA) sensors (biotinylated Protein A captured to a streptavidin sensor tip (ForteBio) (Sartorius). After capture of IgG, the sensors were soaked in PBSF for a minimum of 30 min. Baseline was recorded for 60 s in PBSF before dipping the sensors into the antigen solution (100 nM in PBSF) for 180 s (association) followed by PBSF for 180 s (dissociation). For binding studies with GP38, biotinylated GP38 (100 nM in PBSF) was loaded onto streptavidin sensors (ForteBio, Cat #: 18-5021), soaked in PBSF (30 min), exposed to IgG in solution (100 nM in PBSF, 180 s), and then dipped into PBSF (dissociation, 180 s). For binding studies with murine antibodies, either murine IgG was loaded onto anti-mouse Fc capture (AMC, ForteBio) sensors, or biotinylated antigen (Gn/Gc, Gc, or GP38) was loaded onto streptavidin sensors and the assays were performed as described above. Binding was determined by a response of > 0.1 nm upon exposure to the antigen or IgG. The binding curves were fit to a 1:1 binding model using the ForteBio Data Analysis Software version 11.1.3.10. Irrelevant, anti-hen egg lysozyme human IgG or murine IgG isotype controls were used as negative controls in these assays.
Biotinylated CCHFV rGn/Gc IbAr10200 (5 nM, 15 nM, or 50 nM) was incubated with a twentyfold excess of anti-CCHFV Fab (100 nM, 300 nM, or 1 μM respectively) for 30 min at room temperature before mixing with yeast expressing monoclonal anti-CCHFV rGn/Gc IgG. After washing with PBSF to remove unbound antigen, the bound antigen was detected using streptavidin Alexa Fluor 633 (Invitrogen) and antibody light chain was detected using Goat F(ab’)2 anti-human kappa FITC and Goat F(ab’)2 anti-human lambda FITC (SouthernBiotech). The samples were analyzed by flow cytometry using FACSCanto II (BD Biosciences). The amount of antigen bound was normalized to the light chain FITC level. Competition level was determined by the fold reduction in normalized antigen binding in the presence of a competitor Fab compared to antigen binding in the absence of competition: Fold Reduction = (AF633 MFI/FITC MFI) No-competition / (AF633 MFI/FITC MFI) Competition . Antibodies with greater than tenfold reduction were considered to be in competition with the precomplexed Fab.
A plasmid was designed whereby CCHFV Gc (IbAr10200, Gc amino acid residues [from GenBank Accession: NC_005300 ] 1041-1579) was inserted into a plasmid with an N-terminal HA tag - G 4 S linker and C-terminal G 4 S linker - HA tag - (G 4 S) 2 linker - Aga2. Yeast carrying the plasmid encoding CCHFV Gc (see below for transformation details) were grown overnight in synthetic complete (SC) media minus tryptophan, 4% dextrose, 0.1 M sodium phosphate, pH 6.3). The following day, yeast were inoculated into a new culture at a density of 0.2 OD. Once the yeast had grown to ∼1.0 OD, the yeast were pelleted (2200 x g, 3 minutes) and the pellet was resuspended with the same volume of galactose-containing media (SC media minus tryptophan, 2% galactose, 2% raffinose, 0.01 M Sodium phosphate, 0.13 M NaCl, pH 6.0). The cultures were then shaken at 16°C for 36-48 hours. After 36-48 hours, the yeast were pelleted and washed once with cold PBSF (PBS + 0.1% BSA) before staining for flow cytometry (see below).
Alanine scan libraries across the whole length of CCHFV IbAr10200 Gc were constructed by using pools of eight overlapping 60-mer oligonucleotides (Integrated DNA Technologies) each encoding sequential alanine mutations in the center of each oligonucleotide. Each pool was used to mutagenize eight sequential individual amino acids to alanine with the QuikChange Multi Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent) according to the manufacturer’s directions. The resulting plasmid pools were transformed into chemically competent E. coli in 96-well plates (NEB, Cat#C2987P). After overnight growth of E. coli , the plasmid pools were isolated by a 96-well miniprep kit (Macherey-Nagel, Cat#740616.4). Isolated plasmid pools were then transformed chemically as described above ( Gietz and Woods, 2006 31. Gietz, R.D. ∙ Woods, R.A. Yeast transformation by the LiAc/SS Carrier DNA/PEG method Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 313 :107-120 PubMed Google Scholar ). For sorting, pools of eight mutations from each well were combined to ∼160 amino acid stretches (∼20 pools, 4 alanine scanning libraries) for ease of downstream sequencing.
As previously reported ( Mata-Fink et al., 2013 51. Mata-Fink, J. ∙ Kriegsman, B. ∙ Yu, H.X. ... Rapid conformational epitope mapping of anti-gp120 antibodies with a designed mutant panel displayed on yeast J. Mol. Biol. 2013; 425 :444-456 Crossref Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ), PCR with an error-prone polymerase (Agilent, GeneMorph II Random Mutagenesis Kit) was used to generate a randomly mutagenized Gc library. Amplification of 500 ng of target DNA in 25 cycles was used to keep the mutation rate low. The resulting product was combined with digested plasmid and electroporated into yeast (strain EBY100, ATCC:MYA-4941), resulting in a maximal diversity of ∼1.6 × 10 7 as determined by the number of colonies that grew on agar plates lacking tryptophan after electroporation.
Displayed wild-type IbAr10200 Gc was used as a control to draw the gates for negative selection of mutant libraries. All staining steps were performed on ice and in the dark when fluorophores were present. Wild-type Gc or Gc mutant libraries were stained with an anti-CCHFV rGn/Gc IgG at 10 nM in PBSF. After washing twice with PBSF, wild-type Gc or Gc mutant libraries were stained with an anti-HA APC antibody (BioLegend, Clone: 16B12, Dilution: 1:100) and Goat F(ab’) 2 anti-human IgG PE (SouthernBiotech, Dilution: 1:100). Clones displaying loss-of-binding mutants were sorted and cultured in SC media containing dextrose (see above) for subsequent rounds of selection.
Wild-type Gc or Gc mutant libraries were stained with five non-competing antibodies and detected as described above. Displayed wild-type Gc was used as a control to draw the gates for the positive selection of mutant libraries. Mutant clones stained as similar levels relative to wild-type were sorted and plated on agar plates lacking tryptophan. Between 16-32 clones were picked for each library for sequencing. Validation of loss of binding (see below) was performed on clones that contained only single mutations.
Yeast carrying plasmid encoding a single Gc mutation were induced in deep 96-well plates as described above. 36-48 hours after induction, the yeast were washed with PBSF and stained as described above at antibody concentrations of 1 nM or 10 nM. Bound antibody was detected as above. Antibody binding was normalized to the amount of HA tag expression on the surface of the yeast (PE signal / APC signal). Background was determined by staining with an irrelevant anti-hen egg lysozyme antibody followed by the same secondary stain. To determine loss of binding, the normalized binding score was compared to wild-type as a percentage for each antibody tested: (Mutant binding - Mutant background) / (Wild-type binding - Wild-type background) x 100%. Each Gc mutant clone was tested against a panel of antibodies targeting non-overlapping epitopes to ensure loss of binding was specific for a given antibody and antigenic site.
Based on sequence and secondary structure alignment, a homology model for CCHFV Gc was obtained using the structure of Maporal virus Gc in prefusion conformation (PDB ID: 6y62 ) as a template via SWISS-MODEL in the expasy web server ( Waterhouse et al., 2018 75. Waterhouse, A. ∙ Bertoni, M. ∙ Bienert, S. ... SWISS-MODEL: homology modelling of protein structures and complexes Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46 :W296-W303 Crossref Scopus (7341) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Antibody polyreactivity was tested as described previously ( Xu et al., 2013 82. Xu, Y. ∙ Roach, W. ∙ Sun, T. ... Addressing polyspecificity of antibodies selected from an in vitro yeast presentation system: a FACS-based, high-throughput selection and analytical tool Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2013; 26 :663-670 Crossref Scopus (128) PubMed Google Scholar ). 2 × 10 6 IgG-presenting yeast were pelleted in a 96-well plate before resuspension with biotinylated (ThermoFisher Scientific Cat #A39257) soluble membrane and cytosolic protein preparations from Chinese hamster ovary cells and incubated on ice for 20 min. Cells were washed twice with cold PBSF before staining with 50 μL of Extravadin-R-PE (Sigma), goat F(ab’)2 anti-human kappa-FITC (SouthernBiotech), goat F(ab’)2 anti-human lambda-FITC (SouthernBiotech), and propidium iodide (Sigma) and incubating on ice for 20 min. After two additional washes with cold PBSF, cells were resuspended in 50 μL of PBSF to be analyzed by a FACSCanto II (BD Biosciences) with an HTS sample injector. Polyreactivity was determined by the fluorescence intensity of the PE and FITC signals and normalized to three control antibodies with low, medium, and high levels of polyreactivity.
Amino acid sequences for the IbAr10200, Oman, Kosova Hoti, and Turkey strain GPCs were derived from GenBank M-segment sequences with accession numbers NC_005300 , KR864901 , EU037902 , and ALT31694, respectively. Transcription- and entry-competent virus-like particles bearing CCHFV Gn/Gc were generated as described by Zivcec et al. (2015) 85. Zivcec, M. ∙ Metcalfe, M.G. ∙ Albariño, C.G. ... Assessment of Inhibitors of Pathogenic Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Virus Strains Using Virus-Like Particles PLoS Negl. Trop. Dis. 2015; 9 :e0004259 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar . Briefly, BSR-T7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium (DMEM; Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals), 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Life Technologies) and 1% GlutaMax (Life Technologies), prior to transfection with plasmids encoding the CCHFV nucleoprotein (NP), glycoprotein complex (GPC), polymerase (L), as well as T7 polymerase and a minigenome expressing Nano-Glo Luciferase. 10 h post-transfection, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline in order to remove residual Luciferase-expressing plasmid, before supplying fresh DMEM growth media. 48 h post-transfection, tecVLP-containing supernatants were collected, clarified by low-speed centrifugation, and finally pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 30,000 × g for 2.5 h. Pelleted tecVLPs were then resuspended in plain DMEM before storage at −80°C prior to use in any infection experiments.
Infectivity of Oman tecVLPs in the presence of CCHFV-specific mAbs was assessed in Vero cells, maintained in DMEM (Life Technologies) supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Flowery Branch, GA), 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Life Technologies) and 1% GlutaMax (Life Technologies). Prior to infection, a set amount of Oman tecVLPs was incubated with each mAb at concentrations of 35 or 350 nM for 1 h at 4°C. The amount of tecVLPs was determined empirically, in order to achieve a maximal luciferase signal in the target cells of > 500-fold over background. Luciferase signal was assayed in target cells ∼14 h post-infection using the Nano-Glo Luciferase assay system (Promega). The signal for each mAb tested was then normalized to a no antibody control.
Neutralization by select candidate mAbs against tecVLPs carrying divergent Gn/Gc were assessed in Vero cells, maintained as above. Antibodies were diluted to starting concentrations of 350, 175 or 125 nM, before making 3-fold dilutions in complete DMEM. Empirically determined amounts of CCHFV Gn/Gc VLPs, determined as above, were then added and incubated together with the antibodies for 1 h at 4°C. Antibody:tecVLP mixtures were then added to Vero cells and infection allowed to proceed for ∼14 h before Nano-Glo Luciferase activity was assayed. Absolute or relative IC 50 values for each mAb were derived from inhibition curves using non-linear regression (variable slope, 4 parameters; GraphPad Prism).
In order to assess synergistic neutralization, mAbs were combined at a 1:1 molar ratio before performing neutralization assays as described above. Neutralization curves of individual mAbs, and the combinations thereof, were then used to derive combination index values in accordance with the process described for CompuSyn ( Chou, 2006 16. Chou, T.-C. Theoretical basis, experimental design, and computerized simulation of synergism and antagonism in drug combination studies Pharmacol. Rev. 2006; 58 :621-681 Crossref Scopus (4055) PubMed Google Scholar ; Chou and Talalay, 1984 17. Chou, T.-C. ∙ Talalay, P. Quantitative analysis of dose-effect relationships: the combined effects of multiple drugs or enzyme inhibitors Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1984; 22 :27-55 Crossref Scopus (6240) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, values were log transformed and analyzed using simple linear regression. From the slope and median effect dose, CI values were then calculated using the Combination index equation.
CCHFV-IbAr10200 was incubated with serial 3-fold dilutions of mAbs for 1 h at 37°C in a humidified incubator. The antibody-virus mixture was applied to monolayers of Vero-E6 cells in a 96-well plate at final multiplicity of infection of 3 and incubated for 1 hour at 37°C in a humidified incubator. Infection media was then removed, and cells were washed once with 1X PBS, followed by addition of fresh cell culture media. Culture media was removed 24 h post infection and cells were washed once with 1X PBS. PBS was removed and plates were submerged in formalin fixing solution, then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton-X for 10 min at room temp and treated with blocking solution. Infected cells were detected by sequential incubation with CCHFV-specific antibody 9D5 (BEI, NR40270) and secondary detection antibody (goat anti-mouse) conjugated to AlexaFluor 488. Infected cells were enumerated using Operetta high content imaging instrument and data analysis was performed using the Harmony software (Perkin Elmer). IC 50 values for each mAb were derived from inhibition curves using nonlinear regression analysis (variable slope, 4 parameters; GraphPad Prism).
pMAZ-IgH and pMAZ-IgL vectors encoding DVD-Igs were subcloned with outer variable domains for both the heavy and light chains N-terminally linked via “ASTKGP” and “TVAAP” linkers, respectively, as previously described ( Wu et al., 2007 81. Wu, C. ∙ Ying, H. ∙ Grinnell, C. ... Simultaneous targeting of multiple disease mediators by a dual-variable-domain immunoglobulin Nat. Biotechnol. 2007; 25 :1290-1297 Crossref Scopus (296) PubMed Google Scholar ). All sequences were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Heavy and light chain vectors were co-transfected into ExpiCHO-STM cells (GIBCO) as per manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were incubated in a humidified shaking incubator (37°C, 8% CO2, 125 rpm), fed on day 1 and harvested on day 8 according to manufacturer’s standard protocol. Clarified supernatant (4000 rpm, 15 min) was incubated with 1ml protein A resin (GoldBio) for 2 h at 4°C. Antibodies were purified using the Gentle Antibody Elution System (Thermo Scientific) and buffer exchanged into 150 mM HEPES [pH7.4], 200 mM NaCl.
Binding properties of DVD-Igs were determined using the OctetRed™ system (ForteBio). Parental IgG was initially loaded onto anti-human IgG Fc biosensors (ForteBio). Biosensors were then allowed to equilibrate in solution containing CCHFV (IbAr10200 strain) rGn/Gc before being transferred into a solution with DVD-Ig.
4- to 8-week-old female 129S6/SvEv- Stat1 tm1Rds (STAT-1 −/− ) mice (Taconic) were exposed to CCHFV-Turkey2004 through intraperitoneal (IP) injection of viral stocks diluted in Hanks balanced salts medium with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS) for a final challenge dose of 100 PFU. Thirty min after challenge, all treatment groups were administered 0.25 mg/mouse of the indicated mAb IP. Animals were then observed for clinical scoring, temperature, and weight change. Mice were monitored daily and euthanized upon reaching institutionally approved endpoint score criteria or study endpoint (28 days postinfection).
5–8-week old male and female Type 1 interferon α/β receptor knockout mice (Type 1 IFNα/β R −/− ) (Jackson Labs) were treated IP with 1 mg of indicated mAb or mAb cocktail or an equivalent volume (200 μL) of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) vehicle. Twenty-four h post-treatment, mice were exposed IP to 100 plaque forming units (pfu) of CCHFV-IbAr10200. Animals were observed daily for clinical signs of disease and morbidity for 28 days. Daily observations were increased to a minimum of twice daily while mice were exhibiting signs of disease. Moribund mice were humanely euthanized on the basis of IACUC-approved criteria.
6–9-week old male and female Type 1 interferon α/β receptor knockout mice (Type 1 IFNα/β R −/− ) (Jackson Labs) were exposed IP to 100 plaque forming units (pfu) of CCHFV-IbAr10200. Mice were treated IP with 1 mg of indicated mAb or mAb cocktail, molar equivalent dose of bsAb, or an equivalent volume (200 μL) of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) vehicle 24 h post-exposure. Animals were observed daily for clinical signs of disease and morbidity for 28 days. Daily observations were increased to a minimum of twice daily while mice were exhibiting signs of disease. Moribund mice were humanely euthanized on the basis of IACUC-approved criteria.
Statistical details for each experiment can be found in the respective figure legends and in the results section. These include the number of replicates (n), measures of precision, and the statistical test used. Levels of somatic hypermutation in Figure 1 were compared using a Mann-Whitney test. Dose-response neutralization curves were analyzed using a 4 parameter logistic model. Survival curves in Figures 6 and 7 were compared by a Mantel-Cox (log-rank) test. All statistical analyses were carried out in GraphPad Prism.
