Title: Vision-dependent specification of cell types and function in the developing cortex


Abstract: Summary

The role of postnatal experience in sculpting cortical circuitry, while long appreciated, is poorly understood at the level of cell types. We explore this in the mouse primary visual cortex (V1) using single-nucleus RNA sequencing, visual deprivation, genetics, and functional imaging. We find that vision selectively drives the specification of glutamatergic cell types in upper layers (L) (L2/3/4), while deeper-layer glutamatergic, GABAergic, and non-neuronal cell types are established prior to eye opening. L2/3 cell types form an experience-dependent spatial continuum defined by the graded expression of ∼200 genes, including regulators of cell adhesion and synapse formation. One of these genes, Igsf9b , a vision-dependent gene encoding an inhibitory synaptic cell adhesion molecule, is required for the normal development of binocular responses in L2/3. In summary, vision preferentially regulates the development of upper-layer glutamatergic cell types through the regulation of cell-type-specific gene expression programs.

Section: Introduction

The establishment of neural circuitry in the mammalian cortex relies on the interaction of the developing postnatal animal with its environment. Cortical circuits comprise diverse cell types interconnected by complex synaptic networks ( Motta et al., 2019 38. Motta, A. ∙ Berning, M. ∙ Boergens, K.M. ...

The formation of this circuitry relies on genetically hard-wired mechanisms mediated by cell recognition molecules and sensory-independent neural activity ( Ackman et al., 2012 1.

These periods of developmental plasticity, known as “critical periods,” are observed in sensory cortical areas and regulate processes such as language development and cognition ( Reh et al., 2020 45. Reh, R.K. ∙ Dias, B.G. ∙ Nelson, 3rd, C.A. ... Critical period regulation across multiple timescales Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2020; 117 :23242-23251 Crossref Scopus (210) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The influence of experience on cortical circuitry in the primary visual cortex (V1) is accessible to molecular, genetic, and functional analysis in the mouse and, thus, is well suited for mechanistic studies ( Hooks and Chen, 2020 20. Hooks, B.M. ∙ Chen, C. Circuitry underlying experience-dependent plasticity in the mouse visual system Neuron. 2020; 107 :986-987 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ). Neural circuitry is patterned by vision ( Gordon and Stryker, 1996 12. Gordon, J.A. ∙ Stryker, M.P. Experience-dependent plasticity of binocular responses in the primary visual cortex of the mouse J.

Binocular circuitry is sensitive to vision after eye opening, but its peak period of sensitivity, demonstrated and defined by the effects of monocular deprivation on cortical ocular dominance, begins about a week after eye opening (∼P21) and continues through ∼P35 ( Espinosa and Stryker, 2012 10.

Visual experience during this period is necessary for the development and maintenance of the neural circuitry underlying binocular vision ( Espinosa and Stryker, 2012 10.

Recent advances in single-cell transcriptomics have uncovered a vast neuronal diversity in the adult mouse V1 ( Hrvatin et al., 2018 21. Hrvatin, S. ∙ Hochbaum, D.R. ∙ Nagy, M.A. ...

Shared and distinct transcriptomic cell types across neocortical areas Nature. 2018; 563 :72-78 Crossref Scopus (871) PubMed Google Scholar ). Previous investigations of vision-dependent changes in gene expression during the critical period have relied on comparing bulk transcriptomic profiles of V1 between normally reared (NR) and visually deprived animals ( Majdan and Shatz, 2006 33.

Lyckman, A.W. ∙ Horng, S. ∙ Leamey, C.A. ... Gene expression patterns in visual cortex during the critical period: synaptic stabilization and reversal by visual deprivation Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105 :9409-9414 Crossref Scopus (59) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consequently, these studies did not investigate vision-dependent gene expression at the level of the diverse cell types in V1. This resolution is crucial to understanding the mechanisms by which experience regulates neural circuitry at the molecular, cellular, and functional levels.
Here, we studied the role of vision in the development of V1 cell types and their circuitry in mice by combining single-nucleus (sn) transcriptomics, statistical inference, sensory perturbations, genetics, and in vivo functional imaging. We assembled a developmental transcriptomic atlas of postnatal mouse V1. Using this as a foundation, we discovered that: (1) vision is required for the establishment and maintentance of L2/3 glutamatergic types, but not other cell types in V1; (2) L2/3 glutamatergic cell types are organized as sublayers in V1 and form a transcriptomic continuum through the graded expression of ∼200 genes; and (3) among these genes, Igsf9b , a vision-regulated cell adhesion molecule, is required in a graded fashion for the functional maturation of L2/3 glutamatergic neurons. Together, our study establishes a framework for future investigations of how experience regulates cell type specification in the brain.

Section: Results

To survey the transcriptomic diversity and maturation of cells in V1, we used droplet-based sn RNA-seq to profile this region during postnatal development in NR mice ( Figures 1 A and S1 D). We collected samples from six postnatal time points: P8, P14, P17, P21, P28, and P38 ( Figure 1 B). Three of these are prior to the classical critical period for ocular dominance plasticity, with synaptogenesis occurring between P8 and eye opening (P14) ( Hinojosa et al., 2018 19. Hinojosa, A.J. ∙ Deogracias, R. ∙ Rico, B.

Bull. 2010; 81 :107-113 Crossref Scopus (59) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures S1 A–S1C), and the remaining three span the critical period of ocular dominance plasticity ( Gordon and Stryker, 1996 12.

Data from each time point consisted of four sn library replicates, each derived from cells collected from multiple mice ( STAR Methods ). The resulting gene expression matrices were filtered to remove low-quality cells and doublets ( Wolock et al., 2019 61. Wolock, S.L. ∙ Lopez, R. ∙ Klein, A.M. Scrublet: computational identification of cell doublets in single-cell transcriptomic data Cell Syst. 2019; 8 :281-291.e9 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (835) PubMed Google Scholar ), as well as cells with a high proportion of mitochondrial transcripts (>1%). In total, we obtained 144,725 high-quality nuclear transcriptomes across the six time points ( Figures S1 D–S1H).
We used dimensionality reduction and clustering to derive a developmental taxonomy consisting of cell classes, subclasses, and types ( Yao et al., 2020 65. Yao, Z. ∙ Liu, H. ∙ Xie, F. ...

Neuronal cell-type classification: challenges, opportunities and the path forward Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2017; 18 :530-546 Crossref Scopus (475) PubMed Google Scholar ) at each of the six time points ( Figures 1 C, 1D, and S1 D; STAR Methods ). Cell classes consisted of glutamatergic neurons (n = 92,856; 3,176 genes/cell detected on average), GABAergic neurons (n = 13,374; 2,966 genes/cell), and non-neuronal cells (n = 38,495; 1,549 genes/cell) identified by canonical markers ( Figure S1 I; Table S1 ) ( Hrvatin et al., 2018 21. Hrvatin, S. ∙ Hochbaum, D.R. ∙ Nagy, M.A. ... Single-cell analysis of experience-dependent transcriptomic states in the mouse visual cortex Nat.

Adult mouse cortical cell taxonomy revealed by single cell transcriptomics Nat. Neurosci. 2016; 19 :335-346 Crossref Scopus (1056) PubMed Google Scholar , 2018 53. Tasic, B. ∙ Yao, Z. ∙ Graybuck, L.T. ... Shared and distinct transcriptomic cell types across neocortical areas Nature. 2018; 563 :72-78 Crossref Scopus (871) PubMed Google Scholar ). The relative proportions of the three cell classes were consistent across biological replicates (data not shown).
Glutamatergic cells separated into eight subclasses within the four cortical layers—L2/3, L4, L5IT, L5NP, L5PT, L6CT, L6IT, and L6b ( Figures 2 A and 2B). We also identified six GABAergic subclasses, which included the four well-known groups defined by the selective expression of Pvalb , Sst , Vip , and Lamp5 ( Zeng and Sanes, 2017 68. Zeng, H. ∙ Sanes, J.R. Neuronal cell-type classification: challenges, opportunities and the path forward Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2017; 18 :530-546 Crossref Scopus (475) PubMed Google Scholar ) and two smaller subclasses that selectively expressed the genes Stac and Frem1 . Non-neuronal cells included oligodendrocytes, oligodendrocyte precursor cells, astrocytes, vascular and leptomeningeal cells, endothelial cells, and microglia ( Figure 1 D). Similar results were obtained using an alternative computational pipeline ( Satija et al., 2015 47. Satija, R. ∙ Farrell, J.A. ∙ Gennert, D. ... Spatial reconstruction of single-cell gene expression data Nat. Biotechnol. 2015; 33 :495-502 Crossref Scopus (3012) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S1 K). We found a tight correspondence between the transcriptome-wide gene signatures that defined developing subclasses in our dataset and the subclasses identified in a recent survey of the adult mouse cortex ( Tasic et al., 2018 53. Tasic, B. ∙ Yao, Z. ∙ Graybuck, L.T. ... Shared and distinct transcriptomic cell types across neocortical areas Nature. 2018; 563 :72-78 Crossref Scopus (871) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S1 J).
The relative proportions of most neuronal subclasses were stable over time ( Figures 2 C and S1 L), although proportions of non-neuronal subclasses varied ( Figure S1 M). This suggests that the neuronal subclass composition of V1 is established before P8, our earliest time point. We also identified subclass-specific markers ( Figures 2 B and S2 A–S2E; Table S3 ). This included Ccbe1 (collagen- and calcium-binding epidermal growth factor [EGF] domain-containing protein 1), which is specific for L2/3 glutamatergic neurons throughout development ( Figures 2 D and S2 A–S2C).
Next, we performed dimensionality reduction and clustering for each class at each age separately. We henceforth refer to transcriptomically distinct clusters as types. The eight glutamatergic subclasses separated into 14–16 types, the six GABAergic subclasses separated into 14–15 types, and the six non-neuronal subclasses separated into 9–11 types depending upon age ( Figure 1 D) ( STAR Methods ). Post hoc differential expression analysis identified robust cell-type-specific markers at each age ( Figures S3 A–S3C; Table S4 ).
While the number of cell types within each class was similar at each age, it was not immediately clear how types identified at different ages were related to each other. Using transcriptomic similarity as a proxy for temporal relationships, we tracked the postnatal maturation of types within each class using a supervised classification framework ( STAR Methods ). We observed striking subclass-specific differences in the maturation of glutamatergic neuron types ( Figure 2 E). L5 and, to a slightly lesser extent, L6 neuron types tightly corresponded throughout the time course, indicating that these types are established prior to eye opening and maintained. Conversely, upper-layer neuron types (L2/3 and L4) exhibited poor correspondences, suggesting gradual specification. Within L2/3, two neuron types at P8 and P14 matured into three types after eye opening. By contrast, differences in the maturational patterns of GABAergic and non-neuronal subclasses were less pronounced ( Figures S2 F–S2I; STAR Methods ).
These subclass-specific differences in the timing of glutamatergic neuron type development are supported by five quantitative observations: (1) L5/6 types at different ages could be related in a 1:1 fashion with each other while L2/3/4 types could not be. These differences were based on the adjusted rand index (ARI), a measure of transcriptomic correspondence between two sets of clusters ( Figure 2 F). Furthermore, the clustering results for L2/3 and L4 were more sensitive (p < 0.0001, one-way ANOVA) to changes in the resolution parameter than those for L5 and L6 ( Figure 2 G); (2) the transcriptomic separation among L2/3 and L4 types was lower than that among L5 and L6 types, GABAergic types, and non-neuronal types at all ages ( Figures S2 J–S2L); (3) differentially expressed genes that distinguished L2/3 and L4 neuron types varied with age, whereas those that defined L5 and L6 neuron types were stable ( Figures S3 D–S3G); (4) in a statistical test to identify temporally differentially expressed (tDE) genes in each layer (see STAR Methods ), L2/3 and 4 contained twice as many tDE genes as L5 and 6 ( Figure S3 H); and (5) the relative frequency of L2/3 and L4 types varied over time (see below). By contrast, the relative proportions of the 10 L5 and L6 types, the smallest of which was present at an overall frequency of 1%, were stable throughout the time course. Together, these results suggest that within glutamatergic neurons of V1, transcriptomic specification of types within upper-layer subclasses (L2/3 and L4) occurs later compared with that within lower-layer subclasses (L5 and L6).
We classified L2/3 glutamatergic neurons into three types (A, B, and C) beginning at P17, the first time point assessed after the onset of vision at P14 ( Figure 3 A). These were visualized in tissue using in situ hybridization for marker genes Cdh13 , Trpc6 , and Chrm2 for types L2/3_A, L2/3_B, and L2/3_C, respectively ( Figures 3 B–3D). Within the L2/3 glutamatergic neuron subclass, these transcripts are specific for the aforementioned glutamatergic types. They are, however, expressed in other subclasses as well. Cells expressing the three transcripts were organized into sublayers that became more pronounced with age: L2/3_A close to the pia, L2/3_C bordering L4, and L2/3_B in between ( Figures 3 D and 3E). At the boundaries of these sublayers, cells co-expressed more than one type-specific marker, indicating a lack of discrete, sharp boundaries and mirroring the continuous transcriptomic arrangement observed in silico (see below).
Prior to the onset of vision (P8 and P14), however, only two transcriptomic types were resolved. We denote these as AB and BC. AB and BC were organized as two sublayers based on their differential expression of Cdh13 and Chrm2 ( Figures 3 C and S4 A–S4E), with cells at the border co-expressing the two markers. In contrast, the B marker Trpc6 was weakly expressed in cells scattered throughout L2/3 at these early stages ( Figures 3 B, 3C, 3E–3H, S4 D, and S4E). There is a striking difference in the distribution of Cdh13 between P8 and P38. At P8, Cdh13 extends to the deep sublayers of L2/3, whereas by P38, expression is restricted to a narrow strip of cells at the top of L2/3. By contrast, Chrm2 expression extends slightly more toward upper sublayers at P38. Multiple A-, B-, and C-specific markers were not expressed before P14 and only appeared at later stages ( Figure S3 D). Thus, we infer that the L2/3 glutamatergic types A, B, and C arise from AB and BC types following the onset of vision ( Figure 2 E; STAR Methods ).
The emergence of three L2/3 neuron types following eye opening prompted us to explore the role of vision in defining cell types. It is well established that vision is required for the development of cortical circuitry during the critical period for ocular dominance plasticity (P21–P38) ( Espinosa and Stryker, 2012 10. Espinosa, J.S. ∙ Stryker, M.P. Development and plasticity of the primary visual cortex Neuron. 2012; 75 :230-249 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (457) PubMed Google Scholar ; Gordon and Stryker, 1996 12. Gordon, J.A. ∙ Stryker, M.P. Experience-dependent plasticity of binocular responses in the primary visual cortex of the mouse J. Neurosci. 1996; 16 :3274-3286 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). We used snRNA-seq to profile V1 in animals that were dark reared (DR) from P21 to P28 and from P21 to P38. For brevity, these experiments are referred to as P28DR and P38DR, respectively. We also profiled animals that were exposed to 8 h of ambient light after DR from P21 to P28 to assess the impact of visual stimulation following prolonged deprivation ( Figure 4 A). We refer to this experiment as P28DL (DL = dark light). In total, we recovered 77,150 high-quality nuclei across these three experiments and identified classes, subclasses, and types using the same computational pipeline applied to the NR samples ( Figure 4 B; STAR Methods ).
We performed three computational analyses to probe the effect of visual deprivation (DR and DL) on the transcriptomic patterns observed in NR mice. First, we compared the overall transcriptional profiles of cell types across the three conditions. We found that DR disrupted the type identities of L2/3 and L4, but not L5 and L6, glutamatergic neurons ( Figures 4 C and S5 F). Furthermore, DR altered neither the gene expression patterns that defined subclasses nor those defining GABAergic and non-neuronal cell types ( Figures S5 A–S5C). Second, the cell type markers identified in NR mice were disrupted by DR in L2/3 and slightly in L4, but not in L5 and 6 ( Figures 4 D, 4E, S5 D, and S5E). Third, we probed the effect of visual deprivation on type-specific genes within each layer. While the signatures within all four layers were different when comparing DR to NR, the effect was most dramatic for L2/3 ( Figure S6 H). Thus, vision selectively influences transcriptomic profiles of upper-layer glutamatergic cell types.
The effect of DR was particularly striking in L2/3. The L2/3 clusters observed in DR mice poorly resembled the three types in NR animals, and the expression patterns of cell-type-specific marker genes were disrupted ( Figures 4 C and 4D). By contrast to the three sublayers highlighted by Cdh13 , Trpc6 , and Chrm2 expression in L2/3 in NR mice, only two sublayers were observed in DR mice. Notably, there was a sharp decrease in Trpc6 -expressing cells ( Figures 4 F–4J), consistent with snRNA-seq data ( Figure 4 D). There was also an increase in the number of Cdh13 -expressing cells, and the domain of expression extended into deeper layers. This was not simply a loss of one cell type, however, but a global disruption of gene expression patterns throughout L2/3 (see below, Figure 6 ). The two-layered pattern was more prominent in DR animals at P38 than at P28 ( Figures 4 G–4I, S5 H, and S5I). Thus, in the absence of vision, the expression patterns of these markers were similar to those prior to the onset of vision (see panels P8 and P14 in Figure 3 E).
The loss of cell type identity in animals deprived of light during the first half of the critical period was partially reversible. L2/3 transcriptomic clusters in mice exposed to 8 h of ambient light after DR between P21 and P28 showed a marked recovery of gene expression patterns observed in NR animals ( Figures 4 C, 4D, S5 G, and S6H). In addition, the layered arrangement of Cdh13 -, Trpc6 -, and Chrm2 -expressing cells in these animals was also shifted toward that observed in NR animals ( Figures 4 F–4J, S5 H, and S5I). These results demonstrate that vision is needed to maintain the transcriptomic and spatial identities of L2/3 cell types.
As the spatial expression of cell type markers in the absence of vision and at eye opening were similar, we set out to assess whether vision was not only necessary to maintain cell types but also required for their establishment. To test this, we DR mice from P8 to P17 ( Figure 5 A) and assessed the expression patterns of Cdh13 , Trpc6 , and Chrm2 in tissue sections. These mice had two, instead of three, sublayers within L2/3, similar to P8 and P14 NR animals ( Figures 5 B–5D). These changes included a dramatic reduction in Trpc6- expressing cells and an increase in Cdh13 expression, which was accompanied by an expansion in its expression domain toward the middle sublayer in mice with no visual experience ( Figure 5 E). This was not a general effect on glutamatergic cell types, as the relative proportions of L5 neuron types were insensitive to changes in visual experience ( Figures S4 G and S4H). In summary, these results show that vision acts selectively in L2/3 to establish and maintain cell types.
The sublayers corresponding to types A, B, and C in L2/3 were partially overlapping, mirroring the continuous arrangement of their transcriptomes ( Figures 3 A and 3E). Consistent with this continuous arrangement, more than 70% of the 285 differentially expressed genes among the L2/3 types in NR mice exhibited graded, rather than digital, differences ( Figures 6 A and S6 A–S6H). In DR mice, these genes were no longer expressed in a graded fashion between the L2/3 clusters, although their overall (i.e., bulk) expression levels, for all but a few genes, were unaltered ( Figure S6 C). These gradients were partially recovered by brief restoration of normal visual experience to DR animals during the critical period ( Figure 6 A). Thus, vision selectively regulates gene expression in a sublayer-specific fashion, contributing to the continuous variation of L2/3 cell types.
We hypothesized that graded genes, which are temporally regulated and expressed in a vision-dependent manner, could be associated with functional changes in L2/3 during the critical period. Several genes fit this description, including cell surface molecules (CSMs) and transcription factors (TFs) ( Figures 6 B, 6C, S6 I, and S6J). Among these were cell surface and secreted proteins previously shown to be involved in the development of neural circuits, including proteins regulating cell recognition (e.g., Kirrel3 , Sdk2 ) and synaptic adhesion (e.g., Tenm1 and Cbln2 ) ( Figures 6 B and 6C).
To identify candidate cell surface proteins from this set that may contribute to vision-dependent changes in circuitry during the critical period, we selected genes that satisfied three criteria across all L2/3 glutamatergic types: (1) selective upregulation during the critical period; (2) downregulation in DR animals; and (3) upregulation in DR animals in response to 8 h of ambient light at P28 (i.e., P28DL mice). Five genes ( Igsf9b , Epha10, Cdh4 , Sdk2 , and Sema4a ) satisfied all three criteria ( Figures 6 E and 6F), and all five encode cell surface proteins implicated in regulating neuronal wiring, raising the possibility that they contribute to experience-dependent circuit development in L2/3. As the expression levels and dynamics of Igsf9b were the most robust of this group, we explored its function during the critical period.
IGSF9B is a homophilic cell adhesion molecule of the immunoglobulin superfamily that promotes neuroligin 2 (Nlgn2)-dependent inhibitory synapse formation ( Lu et al., 2017 31. Lu, W. ∙ Bromley-Coolidge, S. ∙ Li, J. Regulation of GABAergic synapse development by postsynaptic membrane proteins Brain Res. Bull. 2017; 129 :30-42 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ; Woo et al., 2013 62. Woo, J. ∙ Kwon, S.K. ∙ Nam, J. ... The adhesion protein IgSF9b is coupled to neuroligin 2 via S-SCAM to promote inhibitory synapse development J. Cell Biol. 2013; 201 :929-944 Crossref Scopus (69) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 6 D). This protein is of particular interest because inhibition plays an important role in regulating V1 circuitry during the critical period ( Reh et al., 2020 45. Reh, R.K. ∙ Dias, B.G. ∙ Nelson, 3rd, C.A. ... Critical period regulation across multiple timescales Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2020; 117 :23242-23251 Crossref Scopus (210) PubMed Google Scholar ). We assessed the spatial distribution of Igsf9b transcripts in L2/3 at different times in development using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) ( Figure 6 G) and in silico by regarding the transcriptomic positions of L2/3 neurons in gene expression space as “pseudo” spatial coordinates ( Figure 6 H; STAR Methods ). Igsf9b levels were low prior to eye opening and increased during the critical period in a graded manner, favoring increased expression deeper into L2/3. Sensory activity further modulated the expression level and lamination of Igsf9b . DR during the critical period decreased Igsf9b expression and slightly disrupted its graded expression in L2/3 neurons ( Figures 6 F, 6I, 6J, and S6 K). These effects were reversed, and Igsf9b expression levels were upregulated when DR animals were exposed to ambient light for 8 h. Given the graded expression of Igsf9b across the sublaminae increasing from upper to lower layers, it was particularly intriguing that a second gene encoding another Ig superfamily protein, Mdga1, a negative regulator of Nlgn2 ( Figure 6 D), was expressed in a graded and opposite spatial pattern to Igsf9b ( Figures 6 G, 6H, and S6 F). Together, the spatiotemporal dynamics of Igsf9b and Mdga1 expression after eye opening form a gradient of inhibitory synapse potential along the pial-ventricular axis of L2/3, with lower sublayers exhibiting increased inhibition.
To explore the role of Igsf9b in the development of inhibitory synapses in L2/3, we examined the expression of five markers of inhibitory synapses in wild-type (WT) and Igsf9b knockout (KO) mice. These markers included three postsynaptic proteins (gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor subunit alpha 1 [GABRA1], neurolign2 [NLGN2], and gephryin [GPHN]) and two presynaptic proteins (the presynaptic vesicular GABA transporter [VGAT] and the enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase [GAD65]) ( Figure S7 A). Expression levels of the postsynaptic markers GABRA1 and NGLN2 were significantly decreased in P37 KO mice relative to WT littermates ( Figure S7 B), although GPHN remained unchanged (not shown). By contrast, there was an increase in the levels of presynaptic markers GAD65 and VGAT ( Figure S7 B); this increase may reflect a homeostatic response to the changes reflected in the decrease in postsynaptic markers. Consistent with our finding that expression of Igsf9b in L2/3 increases with depth, these phenotypes were more pronounced toward the bottom of L2/3 ( Figures S7 D–S7G, 6G, and 6H). By contrast, excitatory synapse markers were unaffected in KO mice ( Figure S7 C). Thus, loss of Igsf9b specifically affects inhibitory synapses in a graded fashion along the L2/3 pial-ventricular axis.
A defining feature of the critical period in V1 is the vision-dependent maturation of binocular neurons, which are required for depth perception, also known as stereopsis ( La Chioma et al., 2019 29. La Chioma, A. ∙ Bonhoeffer, T. ∙ Hübener, M. Area-specific mapping of binocular disparity across mouse visual cortex Curr. Biol. 2019; 29 :2954-2960.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ). To mediate stereopsis, these neurons must selectively respond to the same kind of visual information from both eyes (binocular matching). Although binocular neurons can be detected shortly after eye opening, they exhibit poor matching at early stages. Visual experience during the critical period (P21–P36) changes the population of binocular cells; binocular cells that are poorly tuned are rendered monocular, and new well-tuned binocular neurons arise from well-tuned monocular neurons through recruitment of matched inputs from the other eye ( Tan et al., 2020 51. Tan, L. ∙ Tring, E. ∙ Ringach, D.L. ... Vision changes the cellular composition of binocular circuitry during the critical period Neuron. 2020; 108 :735-747.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar , 2021 50. Tan, L. ∙ Ringach, D.L. ∙ Zipursky, S.L. ... Vision is required for the formation of binocular neurons prior to the classical critical period Curr. Biol. 2021; 31 :4305-4313.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (12) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We examined whether Igsf9b is required for the normal development of binocular responses in L2/3 using in vivo 2-photon calcium imaging in binocular V1 ( Figures S7 H and S7I). This region of V1 comprises not only neurons responsive to both eyes (i.e., binocular cells) but also monocular neurons responsive to stimuli presented to the ipsilateral or contralateral eye only. We measured responses of thousands of excitatory neurons to stimulation of each eye at P21 and P36 in NR WT and Igsf9b KO mice ( Figure 7 A; see STAR Methods ). These results were also compared with those from GCaMP6s transgenic mice that were NR or DR during the critical period ( Tan et al., 2020 51. Tan, L. ∙ Tring, E. ∙ Ringach, D.L. ... Vision changes the cellular composition of binocular circuitry during the critical period Neuron. 2020; 108 :735-747.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 7 A). Neuronal responses were measured at three depths, spanning the top (type A), middle (type B), and bottom (type C) sublayers of L2/3, corresponding to the regions of low, intermediate, and high Igsf9b expression, respectively ( Figures 7 B–7D and S7 J–S7L; see STAR Methods ). At P21, the proportion of binocular neurons and their orientation matching in KO mice were indistinguishable from those in WT mice ( Figure 7 E). This is consistent with the low expression of Igsf9b in L2/3 before P21 ( Figures 6 and 7 A). At P36, after closure of the critical period—when Igsf9b expression would normally have increased—only about half the normal number of binocular neurons were observed in KO mice, and these few neurons displayed poor binocular matching ( Figure 7 F). This phenotype resembles that observed in DR mice ( Figure 7 G).
We also noted a marked decrease in the proportion of tuned cells in KO mice. Untuned cells were active, but by contrast to tuned cells, they were not responsive to specific visual stimuli in a time-locked fashion ( Figures 7 H and 7I). While visual deprivation decreased the proportion of visually responsive neurons from 75% (NR) to 66% (DR), Igsf9b KO decreased the proportion of responsive neurons to 47% by P36 ( Figure 7 J). This reduction in proportion of tuned neurons in KO mice from P21 to P36 correlated with a marked reduction in the signal to noise ratios (SNRs) of neuronal responses at critical period closure ( Figure 7 K, left and middle panels). The extent of SNR impairment in KO was more severe than in DR mice ( Figure 7 K, compare middle and right panels). Notably, the severity of reduction of tuned neurons in KO mice increased with depth ( Figure 7 L), mirroring the graded expression of Igsf9b in L2/3 types A, B, and C along the pial-ventricular axis in NR WT mice (see Figure 6 ). Taken together, these findings establish that Igsf9b regulates the vision-dependent maturation of L2/3 excitatory neurons in a graded fashion along the L2/3 pial-ventricular axis.

Section: Discussion

Critical periods define windows of postnatal development where neural circuitry is particularly sensitive to experience. Here, we sought to gain insight into how experience influences circuitry during this period at the level of cell types in mouse V1.
To study vision-dependent cortical development at the level of cell types, we generated a developmental atlas of mouse V1 comprising over 220,000 nuclear transcriptomes spanning six postnatal ages and three light-rearing conditions. Several features of this dataset enabled us to identify robust and reproducible biological signals. First, we identified a similar number of transcriptomic clusters at all six ages, which were collected and processed separately. For all clusters, transcriptomic identities and relative proportions were comparable between independent samples, consistent with these being bona fide cell types. Second, computational inference of transcriptomic maturation showed that the GABAergic, deep-layer glutamatergic, and non-neuronal cell types were present prior to eye opening and remained largely unchanged through the critical period, whether animals were reared in a normal dark/light cycle or in the dark. Third, these stable cell types served as important “negative controls” that enabled us to identify the minority of cell types among the upper-layer glutamatergic neurons that were specified following eye opening and whose transcriptomic identities were profoundly influenced by vision. Fourth, we identified cell type markers that enabled us to uncover the arrangement of L2/3 cell types in sublayers ( Figures 3 B–3D). Finally, the developmental atlas served as a foundation to investigate vision-dependent functional maturation of V1 at the resolution of cell types and molecules.
In this study, we define a cell type based on a core transcriptomic signature that distinguishes it from other types. When the signature becomes invariant during development, we consider the cell type to be specified. For L2/3 and 4 cell types, these signatures are established following eye opening, whereas for the remaining cell types, they are present from P8. These signatures allow us to assess cell-type-specific gene regulation under sensory deprivation. While activity-dependent gene expression changes occur in every layer, the changes are more extensive in L2/3 and 4, where cell type identity is disrupted. This is not the case for deeper layers (L5 and L6).
It is striking that the acquisition of transcriptomic cell type identity in L2/3 excitatory neurons follows a time course similar to their functional maturation. We previously showed that there are few binocular neurons in L2/3 at eye opening. Their numbers increase over the next several days in a vision-dependent process ( Tan et al., 2021 50. Tan, L. ∙ Ringach, D.L. ∙ Zipursky, S.L. ... Vision is required for the formation of binocular neurons prior to the classical critical period Curr. Biol. 2021; 31 :4305-4313.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (12) PubMed Google Scholar ). During the critical period, these binocular neurons, most of which are poorly tuned, are rendered monocular. In parallel, new binocular neurons are formed from the conversion of other well-tuned monocular neurons, which gained matched responses to the other eye ( Tan et al., 2020 51. Tan, L. ∙ Tring, E. ∙ Ringach, D.L. ... Vision changes the cellular composition of binocular circuitry during the critical period Neuron. 2020; 108 :735-747.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is through this exchange of neurons that well-tuned and matched binocular neurons emerge to give rise to mature binocular circuitry. This process relies on vision during the critical period. Activity may drive cell type changes that, in turn, instruct changes in circuit organization, or alternatively, transcriptomic programs could be regulated by circuit activity. Further experiments will be necessary to distinguish between these and other mechanisms. Experience-dependent regulation of upper-layer cortical cell types may be a general principle underlying cortical development during critical periods.
Although unsupervised clustering defined three predominant glutamatergic neuronal types in L2/3, the gene expression differences between them were graded, giving rise to continuous variation in transcriptomic identity ( Figures 6 A, S6 A, and S6B). This continuous variation in silico was seen as a spatially graded, sublayered arrangement in L2/3 via FISH. This is not a general feature of glutamatergic cell type specification, as glutamatergic cell type identity in L5, for example, is neither graded nor dependent upon vision. Continuous variation of cell type identity has been reported in other regions of the mammalian brain ( Cembrowski et al., 2016 7. Cembrowski, M.S. ∙ Bachman, J.L. ∙ Wang, L. ...

That the molecular heterogeneity in L2/3 reflects functional differences is supported by a recent retrograde labeling analysis of adult V1, which identified transcriptional signatures of L2/3 glutamatergic neurons that project to the anterolateral (AL) and posteromedial (PM) higher visual areas (HVAs) ( Kim et al., 2018 24. Kim, M.H. ∙ Znamenskiy, P. ∙ Iacaruso, M.F. ... Segregated subnetworks of intracortical projection neurons in primary visual cortex Neuron. 2018; 100 :1313-1321.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar , 2020 23. Kim, E.J. ∙ Zhang, Z. ∙ Huang, L. ... Extraction of distinct neuronal cell types from within a genetically continuous population Neuron. 2020; 107 :274-282.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (66) PubMed Google Scholar ). PM- and AL-projecting neurons localize in the upper and lower regions of L2/3 and express the markers Cntn5/Grm1 and Astn2/Kcnh5 , respectively ( Figure S6 D). In our data, these markers are expressed in a graded and opposite fashion along the pial-ventricular axis, suggesting that PM- and AL-projecting L2/3 neurons localize to the upper (type A) and lower (type C) sublayers, respectively ( Figure S6 E).
L2/3 neurons form numerous “local” circuits that process diverse visual information, but these are yet to be defined at the cell type level ( Harris and Mrsic-Flogel, 2013 16. Harris, K.D. ∙ Mrsic-Flogel, T.D. Cortical connectivity and sensory coding Nature. 2013; 503 :51-58 Crossref Scopus (386) PubMed Google Scholar ). While a given excitatory neuron may participate in multiple circuits, there is evidence for synaptic specificity ( Kim et al., 2018 24. Kim, M.H. ∙ Znamenskiy, P. ∙ Iacaruso, M.F. ... Segregated subnetworks of intracortical projection neurons in primary visual cortex Neuron. 2018; 100 :1313-1321.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is tempting to speculate that this functional segregation may, in part, be due to graded molecular differences between neurons uncovered in our transcriptomic analysis. These graded differences may also exist along the mediolateral and anteroposterior axes to further subdivide V1 into functional circuits.
One of our main findings is that vision specifies L2/3 cell types in V1 and that these cell types are arranged in a sublayered fashion. Recent studies have reported the sublayer organization of cell types in L2/3 of the mouse motor cortex, in addition to the visual cortex ( Berg et al., 2021 6.

Spatially resolved cell atlas of the mouse primary motor cortex by MERFISH Nature. 2021; 598 :137-143 Crossref Scopus (138) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting an analogous experience-dependent mechanism may be involved in patterning this region. Emerging transcriptomic, morphological, and physiological evidence of similar cell type continuums arranged in sublayers in L2/3 of the human cortex ( Berg et al., 2021 6. Berg, J. ∙ Sorensen, S.A. ∙ Ting, J.T. ... Human neocortical expansion involves glutamatergic neuron diversification Nature. 2021; 598 :151-158 Crossref Scopus (114) PubMed Google Scholar ) raises the exciting possibility that experience-dependent cell type specification may be a general principle of mammalian cortical development.
Patterns of experience-dependent activity may promote the expression of recognition molecules that regulate wiring. Indeed, different patterns of experience-independent activity have been shown to regulate the expression of cell-type-specific wiring genes in the mouse olfactory system ( Nakashima et al., 2019 40. Nakashima, A. ∙ Ihara, N. ∙ Shigeta, M. ... Structured spike series specify gene expression patterns for olfactory circuit formation Science. 2019; 365 , eaaw5030 Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar ). Our identification of vision-regulated recognition molecules expressed in L2/3 neurons and genetic studies on Igsf9b provide support for the view that experience-dependent processes may also contribute to cell-type-specific wiring ( Figures 7 and S7 ).
Analyses of V1 in mice that lack Igsf9b revealed changes in inhibitory, but not excitatory, synaptic markers. More significantly, Igsf9b −/− mice showed a significant decrease in the proportion of binocular neurons and the proportion of tuned neurons. In the case of the latter phenotype, the severity of the defect increased in deeper sublayers, where in WT animals, Igsf9b expression is higher. A similar impact on the tuning of glutamatergic neurons, more broadly within L2/3, was observed in optogenetic experiments in which perisomatic parvalbumin (PV) inhibitory neuron activity was suppressed ( Zhu et al., 2015 70. Zhu, Y. ∙ Qiao, W. ∙ Liu, K. ... Control of response reliability by parvalbumin-expressing interneurons in visual cortex Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 :6802 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, IGSF9B may modulate PV inhibitory input onto L2/3 excitatory neurons during the critical period. These findings are consistent with previous studies demonstrating the role of IGSF9B in regulating inhibitory synapses.
Our data clearly establish that many genes are expressed in a graded fashion along the pial-ventricular axis of L2/3. The simplest interpretation of this finding is that individual cells at different depths express varying ratios of these genes, which would be consistent with the single-cell sequencing data. However, to directly test this hypothesis, future studies should quantify the expression of multiple genes simultaneously in the same cell as a function of the cell’s position using spatial transcriptomics methods ( Ortiz et al., 2021 43. Ortiz, C. ∙ Carlén, M. ∙ Meletis, K. Spatial transcriptomics: molecular maps of the mammalian brain Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2021; 44 :547-562 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Our single-cell sequencing, FISH, and genetic data support a model in which IGSF9B acts within L2/3 excitatory neurons in a graded fashion to regulate function. This observation mirrors the graded distribution of Igsf9b expression along the pial-ventricular axis in L2/3. However, as our deletion of Igsf9b was systemic, the precise molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the phenotype are unclear. Future experiments in this regard would include inducible, cell-type-specific KOs of Igsf9b in L2/3 excitatory neurons, as well as other neuronal populations, with the goal of examining the maturation of L2/3 receptive tuning properties during the critical period. As IGSF9B physically interacts with Negr1 ( Wojtowicz et al., 2020 58. Wojtowicz, W.M. ∙ Vielmetter, J. ∙ Fernandes, R.A. ... A human IgSF cell-surface interactome reveals a complex network of protein-protein interactions Cell. 2020; 182 :1027-1043.e17 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ), a heterophilic ligand expressed on inhibitory neurons, genetic experiments will be necessary to assess the role of Negr1 in regulating the maturation of L2/3 neurons and to discriminate between the role of IGSF9B-mediated heterophilic versus homophilic interactions in circuit maturation. In a larger context, detailed biochemical, histological, and physiological analyses will be necessary to establish the relationship between the genetic requirement for IGSF9B for the functional maturation of L2/3 neurons and the development of inhibitory synapses.
In summary, our results raise the exciting possibility that experience-dependent cell type specification is a general phenomenon in mammalian brain development. Understanding how the interplay between circuit function, cell type specification, and experience sculpts the circuitry will rely on integrating multiple levels of analysis from molecules to behavior.

Mouse breeding and husbandry procedures were carried out in accordance with UCLA's animal care and use committee protocol number 2009-031-31A, at University of California, Los Angeles. Mice were given food and water ad libitum and lived in a 12-hr day/night cycle with up to four adult animals per cage. Only virgin male C57BL/6J wild-type mice were used for single nuclei sequencing and FISH experiments in this study.
For genetic analysis of Igsf9b , mice used in immunohistochemistry and 2-photon imaging experiments were naive subjects with no prior history of participation in research studies. All live imaging was performed on mice expressing jGCaMP7f in V1B neurons. GCaMP expression was induced by AAV (pGP-AAV-syn-jGCaMP7f-WPRE) intracortically injected into Igsf9b WT and KO mice. WT ( Igsf9b +/+ ) and KO ( Igsf9b -/- ) mice were bred from Igsf9b +/- mice graciously gifted by the Krueger-Burg lab. These mice were originally obtained by their lab from Lexicon Pharmaceuticals (Thee Woodlands, TX, U.S.A.; Omnibank clone 281214, generated through insertion of the Omnibank gene trap vector 48 into Igsf9b gene in Sv129 ES cells). The commercial version of this mouse has since sold to Taconic Biosciences (1 Discovery Drivee, Suite 304, Rensselaer, NY 12144) ( https://www.taconic.com/knockout-mouse/igsf9b-trapped ). The mice were backcrossed onto C57BL/6J background for at least 6 generations by the Krueger-Burg lab and confirmed to be null KO in ( Babaev et al., 2018 3. Babaev, O. ∙ Cruces-Solis, H. ∙ Piletti Chatain, C. ... IgSF9b regulates anxiety behaviors through effects on centromedial amygdala inhibitory synapses Nat Commun. 2018; 9 :5400 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-07762-1 ). Genotyping was performed on P6-P9 pups, and genotypes of pups were identified by PCR that was outsourced to Transnetyx ( transnetyx.com ). Plots for NR and DR mice in Figures 7 G, 7J, and 7K were from unpublished results in Tan et al., 2020 51. Tan, L. ∙ Tring, E. ∙ Ringach, D.L. ... Vision changes the cellular composition of binocular circuitry during the critical period Neuron. 2020; 108 :735-747.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar . A total of 14 mice, both male (9) and female (5) were used in 2-photon imaging. P21 WT: 3 males and 1 female. P21 KO: 1 male and 2 females. P36 WT: 4 males and 1 female (1 female overlaps with P21 WT). P36 KO: 1 male and 4 females (2 females overlap with P21 KO).
Mice that were dark-reared were done so in a box covered from inside and outside with black rubberized fabric (ThorLabs Cat# BK5) for 7-17 days (P21-P28 or P21-P38) or 9 days (P8-P17) before being euthanized. The dark box was only opened with red light on in the room (mice are more than 10-fold less sensitive to red light). Mice that were dark-light reared were first dark-reared for 7 days from P21 to P28 in the dark, and then transferred back to the mouse room to receive 8 hours of ambient light prior to euthanasia. Normally reared mice were housed in a 12 hr light-ON, 12 hr light-OFF cycle. Tissue was collected during a range of 4-8 hours into the light-ON phase. DR mice were dark-reared for a period of 7 (P28 DR) and 17 (P38 DR) days with no light. Tissue was collected immediately after retrieving the mice from the dark box. For the dark-light rearing (P28 DL), mice were placed in the light for 8 hours during the light phase in the mouse room after coming out of the dark box.
Normally-reared mice were dissected at P8, P14, P17, P21, P28, and P38. Isoflurane was used for anesthetization and mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation. Dark-reared mice were dissected at P28 and P38. Dark-light reared mice were dissected at P28 after exposure to 8 hr ambient light. For each age or condition group, 30 mice were dissected: 15 for each biological replicate of single-nucleus(sn) RNA-sequencing. Mice were anesthetized in an isoflurane chamber, decapitated, and the brain was immediately removed and submerged in Hibernate A (BrainBits Cat# HACA). While the dissection was aimed to target V1b, the region enriched for binocular neurons, due to the small size of this region, the dissection invariably captured neighboring V1 tissue. Therefore, we refer to the tissue as V1. Extracted brains were placed on a metal mold and the slice containing V1 was isolated by inserting one blade 0.5 mm posterior to the lambdoid suture and a second blade 1.5 mm further anterior (2 spaces on the mold). This slice was removed and lowered to Hibernate A in a 60cc petri dish, which was placed on a ruler under a dissecting microscope. The midline was aligned with the ruler and the first cut was bilaterally 3.3 mm out from the midline. The second cut was 0.7 mm medial to the first cut. The cortex was peeled off the underlying white matter. The V1 piece with a total of 1 mm cortex depth by 1.5 mm thickness was transferred to a dish containing 600 μl of RNAlater (Thermo Fisher Cat# AM7020) and kept on ice until dissections were complete. Dissected tissues were then kept in RNAlater at 4°C overnight and transferred to -20°C the next day. Tissue was stored this way for up to 1 month prior to being processed for snRNA-seq.
For each biological replicate, dissected V1 regions from 15 mice were removed from RNAlater, weighed, then chopped with a small blade on a cleaned slide on top of a cooling cube. Tissue was then transferred to a dounce homogenizer chilled to 4°C and denounced slowly 30 times with a tight pestle in 1 ml of homogenization buffer containing 250mM Sucrose, 150mM KCl, 30mM MgCl 2 , 60mM Tris pH 8, 1 μM DTT, 0.5x protease inhibitor (Sigma-Aldrich Cat# 11697498001), 0.2 U/μl RNase inhibitor, and 0.1%TritonX. All solutions were made with RNase-free H 2 O. Each sample was filtered through a 40 μm cell strainer and then centrifuged at 1000g for 10 minutes at 4°C. The pellet was resuspended in the homogenization buffer and an equal volume of 50% iodixanol was added to the resuspended pellet to create 25% iodixanol and nuclei mix. This mix was layered upon 29% iodixanol and spun at 13,500g for 20 minutes at 4°C. The supernatant was removed and the pellet was washed in a buffer containing 0.2 U/μl RNAse inhibitor, PBS (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 8 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , and 2 mM KH 2 PO 4, pH 7.4), 1% bovine serum albumin, and then filtered over a 40 μm filter and centrifuged at 500g for 10 minutes at 4°C. The pellet was resuspended and filtered with two more 40 μm filters, cells counted on a hemocytometer and then diluted to 700-1200 nuclei/mm 3 . Nuclei were re-counted on a 10X automated cell counter. Nuclei were further diluted to the optimal concentration to target capturing 8000 cells per channel.
Nuclei from each biological replicate were split into two and run separately on two channels of 10X v3, targeting 8,000 cells per channel. We refer to these as library replicates. For each experiment, we performed two biological replicates towards a total of four library replicates. The two biological replicates were processed on different days. Sequencing was performed using the Illumina NovaSeq™ 6000 Sequencing System (S2) to a depth of ∼30,000 reads per cell. All library preparation and sequencing were performed at the UCLA’s Technology Center for Genomics & Bioinformatics (TCBG) core.
C57/BL6J mice were anesthetized in isoflurane at ages ranging from P8 to P38 and then perfused transcardially with heparinized PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) diluted in PBS and adjusted to pH 7.4. Following perfusion, the brains were collected and postfixed for 24h at 4°C in 4% PFA, and then cryoprotected sequentially in 10%, 20%, and 30% sucrose in PBS solution until the brain sank. Brains were then frozen in OCT using a methylbutane and dry ice bath and stored at -80°C until time of sectioning. Brains were cut into 15 μm thick coronal sections at -22/-20°C using a cryostat (Leica CM 1950) and single sections were collected in a charged microscope slide in ascending order from the frontal to the occipital region starting in V1. For localization of the visual cortex V1 and binocular zone of V1, coordinates from ( Franklin and Paxinos, 2012 11. Franklin, K.P. ∙ Paxinos, G. Paxinos and Franklin's the mouse brain in stereotaxic coordinates, compact, [Fourth Edition] Elsevier, 2012 Google Scholar ) were used. Sections were stored at -80°C until further processing. For all FISH experiments, coronal sections were selected to be from a similar anatomical region within V1 when comparing conditions or ages.
Multiplex FISH was performed following ACD Biology’s Multiplex RNAscope v2 assay (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Cat# 323110). Briefly, thawed sections were baked at 60°C, post-fixed for 1 hr at 4°C in 4% PFA, and then dehydrated in sequential ethanol treatments followed by H 2 O 2 permeabilization and target retrieval. Protease III treatment was used, then application of probes and sequential amplification and fluorophore development fluorophores (Akoya Biosciences Cat# FP1487001KT, FP1488001K, FP1497001KT). Slides were counterstained with 1 ug/ml 4,6-diamidino-2-pheenylindole (DAPI, Sigma Cat #D9542) and mounted with Prolong Gold (Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat# P36930). RNAscope probes used include: Igsf9b (Cat# 832171-C3), Mdga1 (Cat#546411, 546411-C2), Nlgn2 (Cat# 406681). Cdh13 (Cat # 443251-C3), Chrm2 (Cat # 495311-C2), Deptor (Cat #481561 - C3), Gad1 (Cat3 400951-C2), Slc17a7 (Cat# 416631-C2, 416631, 416631-C3), Trpc6 (Cat# 442951), Tshz2 (Cat# 431061-C1). Each time point or condition had three to four biological replicates comprising brain sections from different mice. NR mice at P8, P14, P17, P21, P28, and P38, DR mice at P17, P28, and P38, and DL mice at P28 were used.
Immunolabeling for VGLUT1 and GAD65 on brains at all time points shown was performed on perfusion-fixed brains that underwent the same preparation as for smFISH. Brains were sectioned to 15 μm sections. Sections were then incubated for 24 hr with anti-VGLUT1 (guinea pig polyclonal Millipore Sigma Cat# AB5905) and anti-GAD65 (mouse monoclonal Millipore Sigma Cat#MAB3521R) diluted 1:500 in blocking solution (10% NGS in 0.3% PBST), washed 3x times in PBS, and then incubated for 2 hr with goat anti-mouse 488 (Invitrogen Cat# A11029) and goat anti-guinea pig 568 (Invitrogen Cat#A11075) both diluted 1:500 in blocking solution.
Immunolabeling for synaptic markers in IGSF9B KO vs WT experiments were performed on perfusion-fixed brains sectioned to 40 μm and preserved in aliquots of antifreeze (42.8g Sucrose Fisher Cat # S25590B, 0.33g of MgCl2.6H2O Sigma Cat#M2670, 312.5g (250 mL) glycerol Sigma Cat#G7757, 25mL 10X PBS, total to 500 mL w/ ddH2O). On the day of the experiment, tissues were washed 4 times at 15 minutes per wash from antifreeze using 0.3% PBST, blocked with 10% goat serum in PBST, incubated with primary antibody at 4C for 2 nights (∼44 hours). Samples were washed 4 times, 15 minutes each in 1X PBS, then secondary antibody diluted in blocking solution was added for 2 hr at room temperature. Samples were washed 4 times at 10minutes per wash in 1X PBS then stained with 1:10k DAPI for 15 minutes, washed for 10 min in PBS, and then mounted with Prolong Gold. Primary antibodies used include: anti-VGLUT1 (guinea pig polyclonal Millipore Sigma Cat# AB5905), anti-VGLUT2 (Guinea pig polyclonal Synaptic Systems Cat#135404, anti-GAD65 (mouse monoclonal Millipore Sigma Cat#MAB3521R), anti-NLGN2 (guinea pig polyclonal Synaptic Systems Cat#129205), anti-GABRA1 (rabbit polyclonal Synaptic Systems Cat#224203), anti-GABRG2 (guinea pig polyclonal Synaptic Systems Cat#224004 (anti-GPHN (mouse monoclonal Synaptic Systems Cat#147011), anti-VGAT (rabbit polyclonal Synaptic Systems Cat#131002), anti-PSD95 (rabbit polyclonal Invitrogen Cat#VH307495), anti-SSCAM (rabbit polyclonal Sigma Aldrich Cat#2441). Secondary antibodies used include goat anti-guinea pig 566 (Invitrogen Cat#A11075), goat anti-guinea pig 647 (Life Technologies Cat#A21450), goat anti-mouse 488 (Invitrogen Cat#A11029), goat anti-guinea pig 568 (Invitrogen Cat#A11075), goat anti-rabbit 488 (Life Technologies Cat#A11008), goat anti-mouse 568 (Invitrogen Cat#A11031), goat anti-rabbit 647 (Invitrogen Cat#A21244), goat anti-rabbit 568 (Invitrogen Cat#A11011).
All histology images were acquired on a Zeiss LSM 880 confocal microscope with Zen digital imaging software. In situ hybridization images were acquired using 20x and 40x magnification objectives with 0.8 NA and 1.2 NA, respectively. Each image frame was 1024 pixels x 1024 pixels. For 20X and 40X images, this corresponded to a 425.1 μm x 425.1 μm and 212.5 μm x 212.5 μm coverage area per frame, respectively. Vertically tiled 20X images were acquired covering all cortical layers, as well as 40X horizontal tiled images to cover L2/3 only. Z-stacks were taken to cover the entire 15 μm section. Mdga1 and Ccbe1 , both L2/3-markers, were used as markers to assess the cortical depth covered by each 40X image. For each 40X frame starting at layer 2, one frame covered the depth of L2/3 based on Mdga1 and Ccbe1 signals.
For immunolabeling experiments of synaptic markers, images were taken using a confocal microscope with high NA 63X magnification objective (1.4 NA), imaged on both hemispheres of the brain in L2/3 of V1 based on anatomical landmarks. Each z-stack comprising 15 optical sections spanned the first 5 μm of each section imaged with step interval of 0.3648 μm. For thick (40 μm) immunohistochemical sections, two 5 μm thick z-stacks under 63X objective were vertically tiled to cover the entire L2/3 of V1. Each individual imaging frame is 1024x1024 in pixel with 134.95 μm x 134.95 μm area coverage; two tiled images result in a final area coverage of 134.95 μm x 269.9 μm.
3D z-stacked images were z-projected on FIJI version 2.1.0/1.53c. The entire z-stack covering the slide was projected into a 2D image with maximum intensity. 20X images were tiled using DAPI and Slc17a7 channels (when available) as guides through linear blending to capture the entire cortical thickness. 40X and 63X images were processed as is. Maximum-projected images were entered into CellProfiler using a custom pipeline modified from the original SABER-FISH pipeline ( Kishi et al., 2019 25. Kishi, J.Y. ∙ Lapan, S.W. ∙ Beliveau, B.J. ... SABER amplifies FISH: enhanced multiplexed imaging of RNA and DNA in cells and tissues Nat. Methods. 2019; 16 :533-544 Crossref Scopus (225) PubMed Google Scholar ). Modifications were made to detect up to four imaging channels ( McQuin et al., 2018 36. McQuin, C. ∙ Goodman, A. ∙ Chernyshev, V. ... CellProfiler 3.0: next-generation image processing for biology PLoS Biol. 2018; 16 , e2005970 Crossref Scopus (1113) PubMed Google Scholar ). CellProfiler was used to perform nuclear and cell segmentation, as well as puncta counting. Nuclear segmentation was done by using DAPI and cellular segmentation was done by taking a fixed radius of 5 pixels around the nucleus. For downstream computation, nuclear segmentation results were used. Segmented images had nuclear boundaries as well as individual puncta married in an overlay color with original image items in gray. All segmented images were inspected to ensure no aberration in segmentation or puncta calling.
After segmentation and puncta calling, data were analyzed in R using custom scripts to compare nuclear mRNA counts (i.e., number of puncta) between time points and conditions. For cell type experiments, cells were sorted into types based on mRNA counts of marker genes. Briefly, cells were ranked based on their mRNA counts of each gene and visualized as a scatter plot of counts vs. rank. The knee of this plot was located ( Arneson et al., 2018 2. Arneson, D. ∙ Zhang, G. ∙ Ying, Z. ... Single cell molecular alterations reveal target cells and pathways of concussive brain injury Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :3894 Crossref Scopus (92) PubMed Google Scholar ). The mRNA count value at the knee was chosen as the cutoff for cell type assignment. Quantification of protein puncta in immunolabeling experiments also used Cell Profiler by adapting the same pipeline developed to count mRNA puncta. Protein puncta were quantified per image and normalized by the number of nuclei segmented in that image ( Figures S7 B–S7F). In Figure S7 G, the unique peri-nuclear somatic distribution of NLGN2 enabled its quantification using a 20-pixel boundary around the nucleus and counting the puncta that fell in that boundary. This allowed for quantifying NLGN2 protein puncta per cell.
All epifluorescence and two-photon imaging experiments were performed through chronically implanted cranial windows. Mice aged P10-11 (for P21 imaging) or P25-26 (for P36 imaging) were administered with carprofen analgesia prior to surgery, anesthetized with isoflurane (5% for induction; 0.75–1.5% during surgery), mounted on a stereotaxic surgical stage via ear bars and a mouth bar. Their body temperature was maintained at 37°C via a heating pad. The scalp and connective tissue were removed, and the exposed skull was allowed to dry. Then a thin layer of Vetbond was used to cover the exposed skull and wound margins. Once dry, a thin layer of dental acrylic was applied around the wound margins, avoiding the region of skull overlying V1. A metal head bar was affixed with dental acrylic caudally to V1. A 3mm circular piece of skull overlying binocular V1 on the left hemisphere was removed after using high-speed dental drill to thin the bone along the circumference of this circle. Care was taken to ensure that the dura was not damaged at any time during drilling or removal of the skull.
Local AAV injection into binocular V1 took place after the skull was removed. Exposed brain was submerged in normal saline during injection. AAV was diluted in 1xPBS that contains 2.5% mannitol (w/v) to a final titer of 6.7∼7.5x10 12 genomes per ml. Mannitol was used to increase the viral spread ( Mastakov et al., 2001 35. Mastakov, M.Y. ∙ Baer, K. ∙ Xu, R. ... Combined injection of rAAV with mannitol enhances gene expression in the rat brain Mol Ther. 2001; 3 :225-232 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ). For both age groups, virus was injected at least 10 days before imaging. Virus injection was done using a glass micropipette (tip diameter: 19-25 μm) and Nanoject III (Drummond Scientific Company) attached on Scientifica PatchStar Micromanipulator (Scientifica) controlled with LinLab2 (Scientifica). Injection site was at 3 mm lateral from the midline and 1 mm rostral from lambda. Injections occurred at three depths: 470, 340 and 210 μm below the pial surface. At each depth, 65 cycles of injection were done, with each cycle injecting 5 nL at 5 nL/s speed, with 10 second intervals between cycles. Thus, 325 nL of AAV was injected at each depth, and 975 nL was injected into V1B in total. After virus injection, a sterile 2.5 mm diameter cover glass was placed directly on the exposed dura and sealed to the surrounding skull with Vetbond. The remainder of the exposed skull and the margins of the cover glass were sealed with dental acrylic. Mice were then recovered on a heating pad. When alert, they were placed back in their home cage. Carprofen was administered daily for 3 days post-surgery. Mice were left to recover for at least 10 days prior to imaging. Mice injected at P10-11 would also be imaged at P36 if their cranial windows remained clear.
The precise location of the binocular region in V1 on the left hemisphere for each mouse was identified using low magnification, epifluorescence imaging of jGCaMP7f signals. For all mice, visual areas were mapped the day before imaging. Briefly, jGCaMP7f was excited using a 470nm light-emitting diode. A 27-inch LCD monitor (ASUS, refreshed at 60 Hz) was positioned such that the binocular visual field fell in the center of the monitor. The screen size was 112 deg in azimuth and 63 deg in elevation and the monitor was placed 20 cm from the eyes. A contrast reversing checkerboard (checker size 10x10 degree) bar windowed by a 1D Gaussian were presented along the horizontal or vertical axis to both eyes ( Figure S7 H). The checkerboard bar drifted normal to its orientation and swept the full screen width in 10 sec. Both directions of motion were used to obtain an absolute phase map along the two axes. Eight cycles were recorded for each of the four cardinal directions. Images were acquired at 10 frames per second with a PCO edge 4.2 sCMOS camera using a 35mm fixed focal length lens (Edmund optics, 35mm/F1.65, #85362, 3mm field of view). The camera focused on the pial surface. The visual areas were obtained from retinotopic maps of azimuth and elevation. The binocular area of the primary cortex was defined as the region of primary visual cortex adjacent to the higher visual area LM ( Figure S7 I).
Two-photon imaging was targeted to the binocular area of V1 using a resonant/galvo scanning two-photon microscope (Neurolabware, Los Angeles, CA) controlled by Scanbox image acquisition software (Los Angeles, CA). A Coherent Discovery TPC laser (Santa Clara, CA) running at 920 nm focused through a 16x water-immersion objective lens (Nikon, 0.8 numerical aperture) was used to excite jGCaMP7f. The objective was set at an angle of 10-11 degrees from the plumb line to reduce the slope of the imaging planes. Image sequences (512x796 pixels, 490x630 μm) were captured at 15.5 Hz at a depth of 120 to 320μm below the pial surface on alert, head-fixed mice that were free to run on a 3D-printed running wheel (14cm diameter). A rotary encoder was used to record the rotations of this running wheel. Three planes that were well separated in depth and covered the top, middle and bottom of L2/3 were imaged per mouse ( Figure S7 J). To measure responses of neurons to each eye separately, an opaque patch was placed immediately in front of one eye when recording neuronal responses to visual stimuli presented to the other eye.
On the same screen that was used for visual area mapping, a set of sinusoidal gratings with 18 orientations (equal intervals of 10 degrees from 0 to 170 degrees), 12 spatial frequencies (equal steps on a logarithmic scale from 0.0079 to 0.1549 cycles per degree) and 8 spatial phases were generated in real-time by a Processing sketch using OpenGL shaders (see https://processing.org ). These static gratings were presented at 4 Hz in full screen in pseudo-random sequence with 100% contrast ( Figure 7 A). Imaging sessions were 15 min long (3600 stimuli in total), thus each combination of orientation and spatial frequency appeared 16 or 17 times. Transistor-transistor logic signals were used to synchronize visual stimulation and imaging data. The stimulus computer generated these signals, and these were sampled by the microscope electronics and time-stamped by the acquisition computer to indicate the frame and line number being scanned at the time of the TTL.
Movies for either eye from the same plane were processed together using a standard pipeline consisting of movie concatenation, motion correction, cell segmentation and ROI signal extraction using Suite2p ( https://suite2p.readthedocs.io/ ). ROIs determined for each experiment were inspected and confirmed visually ( Figure S7 K). Neuronal spiking was estimated via non-negative temporal deconvolution of the extracted ROI fluorescence signal using Vanilla algorithm ( Figure S7 L) ( Berens et al., 2018 5. Berens, P. ∙ Freeman, J. ∙ Deneux, T. ... Community-based benchmarking improves spike rate inference from two-photon calcium imaging data PLoS Comput Biol. 2018; 14 :e1006157 Crossref Scopus (73) PubMed Google Scholar ). Subsequently, fluorescent signals and estimated spiking for each cell were split into separate files corresponding to the individual imaging session for each eye. Each imaging plane was processed independently.
A power analysis was not performed a-priori to determine sample size. All statistical analyses were performed in MATLAB ( https://www.mathworks.com/ ), using non-parametric tests with significance levels set at α < 0.05. Bonferroni corrections for multiple comparisons were applied when necessary. Mann-Whitney U-tests (Wilcoxon rank sum test) or two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests were used to test differences between two independent populations.
Fastq files with raw reads were processed using Cell Ranger v3.1.0 (10X Genomics) with default parameters. The reference genome and transcriptome used was GRCm38.92 based on Ensembl 92, which was converted to a pre-mRNA reference package by following Cell Ranger guidelines. Each single-nucleus library was processed using the same settings to yield a gene expression matrix (GEM) of mRNA counts across genes (columns) and single nuclei (rows). Each row ID was tagged with the sample name for later batch correction and meta-analysis. We henceforth refer to each nuclear transcriptome as a “cell.”
This section outlines the initial transcriptomic analysis of data from normally reared samples. Unless otherwise noted, all analyses were performed in Python using the SCANPY package ( Wolf et al., 2018 59. Wolf, F.A. ∙ Angerer, P. ∙ Theis, F.J. SCANPY: large-scale single-cell gene expression data analysis Genome Biol. 2018; 19 :15 Crossref Scopus (2665) PubMed Google Scholar ). The complete computational workflow is illustrated in Figure S1 D. 1. Raw GEMs from 23 snRNA-seq libraries were combined: 6 ages, 2 biological replicates per age and 2 library replicates per biological replicate except for P38, where one of the technical replicates failed quality metrics at the earliest stage of processing. This resulted in a GEM containing 184,936 cells and 53,801 genes. 2. We then generated scatter plots of the number of transcript molecules in each cell (n_counts), the percent of transcripts derived from mitochondrially encoded genes (percent_mito), and the number of expressed genes (n_genes) to identify outlier cells. Cells that satisfied the following conditions were retained: 700 < n_genes < 6500, percent_mito < 1%, and n_counts < 40,000. Only genes detected in more than 8 cells were retained for further analysis. This resulted in a GEM of 167,384 cells and 30,869 genes. 3. Cells were normalized for library size differences. Transcript counts in each cell were rescaled to sum to 10,000 followed by log-transformation. For clustering and visualization, we followed steps described previously ( Peng et al., 2019 44. Peng, Y.R. ∙ Shekhar, K. ∙ Yan, W. ... Molecular classification and comparative taxonomics of foveal and peripheral cells in primate retina Cell. 2019; 176 :1222-1237.e22 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (259) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, we identified highly variable genes (HVGs), z-scored expression values for each gene, and computed a reduced dimensional representation of the data using principal component analysis (PCA). The top 40 principal components (PCs) were used to compute a nearest-neighbor graph on the cells. The graph was then clustered using the Leiden algorithm ( Traag et al., 2019 54. Traag, V.A. ∙ Waltman, L. ∙ van Eck, N.J. From Louvain to Leiden: guaranteeing well-connected communities Sci. Rep. 2019; 9 :5233 Crossref Scopus (1694) PubMed Google Scholar ) and embedded in 2D via the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) algorithm ( Becht et al., 2018 4. Becht, E. ∙ McInnes, L. ∙ Healy, J. ... Dimensionality reduction for visualizing single-cell data using UMAP Nat. Biotechnol. 2018; Crossref Scopus (2405) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The analysis above yielded 42 clusters ( Figures S1 E and S1F). Canonical marker genes for cortical classes and subclasses were used to annotate these clusters ( Figure S1 G and Table S1 ). We then used Scrublet ( Wolock et al., 2019 61. Wolock, S.L. ∙ Lopez, R. ∙ Klein, A.M. Scrublet: computational identification of cell doublets in single-cell transcriptomic data Cell Syst. 2019; 8 :281-291.e9 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (835) PubMed Google Scholar ) to identify doublets ( Figure S1 H). Clusters that expressed markers of two or more classes or contained more than 50% doublets were labeled “Ambiguous” ( Figure S1 I). Removal of ambiguous clusters and doublets in the dataset resulted in a GEM containing 147,236 cells by 30,868 genes.
For further analysis, this matrix was subsetted by cell class (glutamatergic neurons, GABAergic neurons, and non-neuronal cells) and age (P8, P14, P17, P21, P28 and P38) into 18 separate GEMs ( Figure S1 D).
Each of the 18 GEMs were separately clustered using the procedure described above with one modification. Following PCA, we used Harmony ( Korsunsky et al., 2019 28. Korsunsky, I. ∙ Millard, N. ∙ Fan, J. ... Fast, sensitive and accurate integration of single-cell data with Harmony Nat. Methods. 2019; 16 :1289-1296 Crossref Scopus (2446) PubMed Google Scholar ) to perform batch correction. The nearest-neighbor graph was computed using the top 40 batch-corrected PCs.
Each GEM was then iteratively clustered. We began by clustering cells using the Leiden algorithm, with the resolution parameter fixed at its default value of 1. As before, UMAP was used to visualize the clusters in 2D. Through manual inspection, small clusters with poor quality metrics or ambiguous expression signatures were discarded, likely representing trace contaminants that escaped detection in the earlier steps. The remaining clusters were annotated by subclass based on canonical expression markers ( Table S1 , Figure 1 D). Next, we performed a differential expression (DE) analysis between each cluster and other clusters in its subclass. If a cluster did not display unique expression of one or more genes, it was merged with the nearest neighboring cluster in the UMAP embedding as a step to mitigate over-clustering. This DE and merging process was repeated until each cluster had at least one unique molecular signature ( Figures S3 A–S3C). We refer to the final set of clusters as types.
To assess transcriptomic correspondence of clusters across ages or between rearing conditions, we used XGBoost, a gradient boosted decision tree-based classification algorithm ( Chen and Guestrin, 2016 9. Chen, T. ∙ Guestrin, C. XGBoost: A scalable tree boosting system Proceeding of the 22nd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining 2016; 785-794 arXiv: 1603.02754v3 Crossref Scopus (24021) Google Scholar ). In a typical workflow, we trained an XGBoost (version 1.3.3) classifier to learn subclass or type labels within a “reference” dataset, and used it to classify cells from another, “test” dataset. The correspondences between cluster IDs and classifier-assigned labels for the test dataset are used to map subclasses or types between datasets. The classification workflow is described in general terms below and applied to various scenarios in subsequent sections.
Let R denote the reference dataset containing N R cells grouped into r clusters. Let T denote the test dataset containing N T cells grouped into t clusters. Here, each cell is a normalized and log-transformed gene expression vector u ∈ R or v ∈ T . The length of u or v equals the number of genes. Based on clustering results, each cell in R or T is assigned a single cluster label, denoted cluster( u ) or cluster( v ). cluster( u ) may be a type or subclass identity, depending on context.
The main steps are as follows: 1. We trained multi-class XGBoost classifiers C R 0 and C R T on R and T independently using all 30,868 genes as features. In each case, the dataset was split into training and validation subsets. For training we randomly sampled 70% of the cells in each cluster, up to a maximum of 700 cells per cluster. The remaining “held-out” cells were used for evaluating classifier performance. Clusters with fewer than 100 cells in the training set were upsampled via bootstrapping to 100 cells in order to improve classifier accuracy for the smaller clusters. Classifiers achieved a 99% accuracy or higher on the validation set. XGBoost parameters were fixed at the following values: 1. ‘Objective’: ‘multi:softprob’ 2. ‘eval_metric’: ‘mlogloss’ 3. ‘Num_class’: r (or t ) 4. ‘eta’: 0.2 5. ‘Max_depth’: 6 6. ‘Subsample’: 0.6 2. When applied to a test vector c , the classifier C R 0 or C R T returns a vector p = (p 1 , p 2 , …) of length r or t , respectively. Here, p i represents the probability value of predicted cluster membership within R or T , respectively. These values are used to compute the “softmax” assignment of c , such that cluster( c ) = arg max i p i if arg max i p i is greater than 1.2 ∗ (1/r) or 1.2 ∗ (1/t). Otherwise c is classified as ‘Unassigned’. 3. Post training, we identified the set of top 500 genes based on average information gain for each C R 0 and C R T . These gene sets are denoted G R and G T . 4. Using the common genes G = G R ⋂ G T , we trained another classifier C R on 70% of the cells in R, following the procedure outlined in 1. As before, the performance of C R was evaluated on the remaining 30% of the data. 5. Finally, we trained a classifier C R on 100% of the cells in R. C R was then applied to each cell v ∈ T to generate predicted labels cluster( v ).
We used the aforementioned classification workflow to evaluate the correspondence between V1 subclasses in this work ( Figure 1 D) and those reported in a recent study of the adult V1 and motor cortex (ALM) ( Tasic et al., 2018 53. Tasic, B. ∙ Yao, Z. ∙ Graybuck, L.T. ... Shared and distinct transcriptomic cell types across neocortical areas Nature. 2018; 563 :72-78 Crossref Scopus (871) PubMed Google Scholar ). We trained a classifier on the V1/ALM subclasses and used it to assign an adult label to each V1 cell collected in this study. A confusion matrix was used to visualize the correspondence between developmental V1 subclasses and V1/ALM subclasses at adulthood ( Figure S1 J). This correspondence served as a proxy to evaluate the overall conservation of subclass-specific transcriptomic signatures across developmental stages (developing vs. adult), RNA source (single-nucleus vs. single-cell), platform (3’ droplet-based vs. full-length plate-based), and region (V1 vs. V1/ALM).
Differential expression (DE) was performed in multiple settings to identify genes enriched in specific classes, subclasses, types, or rearing conditions. We used the scanpy.tl.rank_genes_groups() function and Wilcoxon rank-sum test in the scanpy package for statistical comparisons ( Wolf et al., 2018 59. Wolf, F.A. ∙ Angerer, P. ∙ Theis, F.J. SCANPY: large-scale single-cell gene expression data analysis Genome Biol. 2018; 19 :15 Crossref Scopus (2665) PubMed Google Scholar ). While searching for genes enriched in a particular group of interest, only those expressed in >20% of cells in the tested group were considered.
The results of the DE analyses were used in the following contexts: (1) To assess the quality of cell populations identified in the initial analysis, where each cluster in Figure S1 F was compared to the rest. Clusters that did not express a unique signature or those that express markers known to be mutually exclusive were removed; (2) To identify subclass markers ( Figures 2 B, S2 D, and S2E). This was accomplished by comparing each subclass against the rest; (3) To identify type-specific markers within each subclass ( Figures S3 A–S3C). Here, each type was compared to other types of the same subclass; and (4) To identify gene expression changes as a result of visual deprivation. We performed DE between NR and DR (both ways) subclasses ( Figure 6 A and S6A).
We compared each L2/3 type to the other two (e.g., A vs B and C) to identify 287 type-specific genes at fold change > 2 and p-value < 10 -10 (Wilcoxon test). The expression levels of these genes were z-scored, and we used k -means clustering to identify k =7 groups based on their pattern of expression among the three types ( Figure S6 A). The optimal number of groups was identified using the elbow method. Five of the seven groups, containing 217 genes, showed graded expression differences that could be classified into one of the following patterns based on visual inspection: A > B > C (77 genes), A < B > C (36 genes), C > A > B (9 genes), C > B > A (85 genes) and A > C > B (10 genes). The remaining X genes were expressed in a digital fashion that fell into one of two groups: C > B = A (35 genes) and A > B = C (35 genes). Thus, approximately 75% of the DE genes among L2/3 types are expressed in a graded fashion.
FISH experiments targeting the three L2/3 glutamatergic type markers revealed that type A resides at the top (near the pia), type B in the middle, and type C at the bottom of L2/3, bordering L4 ( Figure 3 ). Surprisingly, this relative positioning of A, B, and C types was mirrored in the UMAP embedding. We therefore hypothesized that the UMAP coordinates of a neuron may serve as a proxy for the approximate relative position of its soma in the tissue and used this to calculate the expected spatial expression profiles of genes in each dataset.
In a given scenario, we marked the “A” and “C” cells furthest from each other on the UMAP space as the “root” and the “leaf” and assumed that these represent the top and bottom of L2/3 respectively. We used diffusion pseudo-time (DPT) ( Haghverdi et al., 2015 15. Haghverdi, L. ∙ Buettner, F. ∙ Theis, F.J. Diffusion maps for high-dimensional single-cell analysis of differentiation data Bioinformatics. 2015; 31 :2989-2998 Crossref Scopus (383) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wolf et al., 2019 60. Wolf, F.A. ∙ Hamey, F.K. ∙ Plass, M. ... PAGA: graph abstraction reconciles clustering with trajectory inference through a topology preserving map of single cells Genome Biol. 2019; 20 :59 Crossref Scopus (641) PubMed Google Scholar ) to order all L2/3 cells relative to the root cell. DPT and similar methods have been used previously to order cells based on their developmental state (i.e., pseudo-time); we have used it in this context to infer “pseudo-spatial” position based on the observed correspondence described above. Pseudo-spatial positions for cells were close to 0 at the top, where type A begins, and gradually increased through types B and C, reaching the maximum normalized value of 1 at the end of L2/3 in UMAP space. We performed this pseudo-spatial analysis for L2/3 neurons in each of the six normally reared samples.
For the DR and DL datasets, where the spatial organization and transcriptomic profiles are disrupted, a root cell was randomly selected from the beginning of L2/3 in UMAP space (e.g., a cell from the edge of cluster “L2/3_1” was chosen for P28DR) ( Figure 4 B). Finally, to visualize the expression of gradient genes as a function of pseudo-spatial position ( Figures 6 F and 6H), we averaged the expressions along bins of pseudo-spatial location that contained as many cells as ∼10% of a given dataset.
This analysis was repeated separately for each of L2/3, L4, L5, and L6. Of the 30,868 genes in the data, we considered only those expressed in more than 20% of the cells in at least one of the six time points. This resulted in 6339, 5746, 6096, and 5428 genes for further analysis in L2/3, L4, L5, and L6, respectively. We first computed the average expression strength of every gene at each of the six time points. Here, the average expression strength 𝐸 𝑔 , 𝑡 of gene 𝑔 at age 𝑡 is defined as follows, 𝐸 𝑔 , 𝑡 = 𝐹 𝑔 , 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑋 𝑔 , 𝑡 where 𝐹 𝑔 , 𝑡 is the fraction of cells at age 𝑡 that express gene 𝑔 and 𝑋 𝑔 , 𝑡 is the mean transcript counts of 𝑔 among cells with non-zero expression. We only considered genes that satisfied the following condition, 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑥 ⁡ ( 𝐸 𝑔 , 𝑡 ) − 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁡ ( 𝐸 𝑔 , 𝑡 ) 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑥 ⁡ ( 𝐸 𝑔 , 𝑡 ) ≥ 0 . 3
resulting in 2594, 2410, 2190, and 2192 genes for further analysis in L2/3, L4, L5, and L6, respectively. Next, to identify genes that showed significant temporal variation, we z-scored each 𝐸 𝑔 vector and randomly shuffled the temporal identities of the cells. We then recomputed a randomized analog of 𝐸 𝑔 , 𝑡 , which we call ̂ 𝐸 𝑔 , 𝑡 . We then defined for each gene 𝑔 a deviation score between the actual and randomized expression vectors, α 𝑔 = ∑ 𝑇 𝑡 ( 𝐸 𝑔 , 𝑡 − ̂ 𝐸 𝑔 , 𝑡 ) 2 √ ∑ 𝑇 𝑡 𝐸 2 𝑔 , 𝑡 ⁢ ∑ 𝑇 𝑡 ̂ 𝐸 2 𝑔 , 𝑡
Here, 𝑇 = 6 is the number of time points and the denominator acts as a normalizing factor; we observed a bias towards highly expressed genes in its absence. High values of α 𝑔 indicate that the observed temporal pattern of expression is significantly different from the randomized pattern. We picked 855 genes for further analysis that had 𝛼 𝑔 > 0.2. This threshold was chosen by computing an empirical null distribution for 𝛼 𝑔 using two randomizations 𝐸 1 𝑔 , 𝑡 and ̂ 𝐸 2 𝑔 , 𝑡 . The 99.9 th percentile value of 𝑃 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁡ ( α 𝑔 ) was 0.05, making 𝛼 𝑔 = 0.2 a conservative threshold. Finally, we counted the number of temporally differentially expressed (tDE) genes identified in each layer ( Figure S3 H)
In addition to clustering each time separately in SCANPY, Seurat (version 3.1, ( Satija et al., 2015 47. Satija, R. ∙ Farrell, J.A. ∙ Gennert, D. ... Spatial reconstruction of single-cell gene expression data Nat. Biotechnol. 2015; 33 :495-502 Crossref Scopus (3012) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used to cluster data from all times and conditions together. This analysis was done to evaluate class and subclass level clustering, and to provide a framework to broadly check gene expression for FISH experiments in all subclasses at all times collectively. Seurat clustering was performed using two methods with similar final results. In the log-normalization based method, data were log normalized and scaled to 10,000 transcripts per cell, with 2000 variable genes used. In the generalized linear model method “SCTransform” ( Hafemeister and Satija, 2019 14. Hafemeister, C. ∙ Satija, R. Normalization and variance stabilization of single-cell RNA-seq data using regularized negative binomial regression Genome Biol. 2019; 20 :296 Crossref Scopus (1641) PubMed Google Scholar ), normalization was used with 3000 variable genes. In both methods cells with fewer than 1000 or over 6000 genes or >1% mitochondrial content were filtered out. PCA was performed and unsupervised clustering was applied to the top 80 PCs. Major cell type markers from ( Tasic et al., 2016 52. Tasic, B. ∙ Menon, V. ∙ Nguyen, T.N. ... Adult mouse cortical cell taxonomy revealed by single cell transcriptomics Nat. Neurosci. 2016; 19 :335-346 Crossref Scopus (1056) PubMed Google Scholar ) and ( Tasic et al., 2018 53. Tasic, B. ∙ Yao, Z. ∙ Graybuck, L.T. ... Shared and distinct transcriptomic cell types across neocortical areas Nature. 2018; 563 :72-78 Crossref Scopus (871) PubMed Google Scholar ) were used to assign class and subclass designations to clusters. Clusters having two or more major markers were discarded as “doublet/debris” clusters, and clusters that were solely composed of one or two replicates were also discarded as debris clusters. In both log-normalization and SCT clustering by Seurat, the P8 cortico-cortical projecting excitatory neurons clustered separately from similar subclass neurons of later time points. Thus, P8 was clustered separately, and cell IDs from P8-only clustering were used to re-label the corresponding P8 cells in the full dataset. Class and subclass level clustering results matched SCANPY-based results ( Figure S2 J).
The Seurat-based clustering results were primarily used to assess subclass-level differentially expressed genes. Gene signatures of each cell subclass at different time points were identified with the FindMarkers function, performing pairwise time or condition comparisons and by comparing one time point to the average of others (a second method only used normally reared datasets). Genes were considered if they were present in 10% of cells, 0.25 log fold enriched (1.28-fold change or more), and had a Benjamini-Hochberg corrected P <0.05. Of these, genes that were 0.4 log fold enriched (1.5-fold change or more) were classified as enriched.
