Title: Receptor-associated independent cAMP nanodomains mediate spatiotemporal specificity of GPCR signaling


Abstract: Summary

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) relay extracellular stimuli into specific cellular functions. Cells express many different GPCRs, but all these GPCRs signal to only a few second messengers such as cAMP. It is largely unknown how cells distinguish between signals triggered by different GPCRs to orchestrate their complex functions. Here, we demonstrate that individual GPCRs signal via receptor-associated independent cAMP nanodomains (RAINs) that constitute self-sufficient, independent cell signaling units. Low concentrations of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and isoproterenol exclusively generate highly localized cAMP pools around GLP-1- and β 2 -adrenergic receptors, respectively, which are protected from cAMP originating from other receptors and cell compartments. Mapping local cAMP concentrations with engineered GPCR nanorulers reveals gradients over only tens of nanometers that define the size of individual RAINs. The coexistence of many such RAINs allows a single cell to operate thousands of independent cellular signals simultaneously, rather than function as a simple “on/off” switch.

Section: Introduction

Receptors and their downstream signaling pathways regulate essentially all functions of multicellular organisms. The main class of receptors is constituted by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and their downstream intracellular second messengers, notably cAMP and calcium ( Rosenbaum et al., 2009 52.

Since a single cell can express up to 100 different GPCRs ( Insel et al., 2015 33. Insel, P.A. ∙ Wilderman, A. ∙ Zambon, A.C. ... G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) expression in native cells: “novel” endoGPCRs as physiologic regulators and therapeutic targets Mol. Pharmacol. 2015; 88 :181-187 Google Scholar ), it poses a formidable challenge for a cell to distinguish between the inputs from its different GPCRs to assure specific downstream cell functions. This appears particularly difficult for the many GPCRs that stimulate intracellular cAMP, which has been generally considered a highly diffusible molecule that would rapidly equilibrate across a cell and would, thus, produce the same biochemical response irrespective of the specific GPCR.
Attempts to search for specific signaling signatures of different GPCRs have been made for several decades. Thus, it has been shown long ago that in some cells, for example, cardiac myocytes and hepatocytes, two different GPCRs may increase intracellular cAMP levels to the same extent but may have distinct functional effects ( Brunton et al., 1979 13.

Nikolaev, V.O. ∙ Moshkov, A. ∙ Lyon, A.R. ... Beta2-adrenergic receptor redistribution in heart failure changes cAMP compartmentation Science. 2010; 327 :1653-1657 Google Scholar ). A classic example is the observation that isoproterenol (via β-adrenergic receptors) and prostaglandin E 1 (via EP receptors) cause the same cAMP increase, but only isoproterenol increases cardiac contractile force and activates glycogen metabolism ( Buxton and Brunton, 1983 14. Buxton, I.L. ∙ Brunton, L.L. Compartments of cyclic AMP and protein kinase in mammalian cardiomyocytes J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258 :10233-10239 Google Scholar ). Similarly, we have shown that in cardiac myocytes stimulation of β 2 -adrenergic receptors (β 2 -ARs) increases cAMP only locally, whereas stimulation of β 1 -ARs increases cAMP globally, eventually leading to changes in gene transcription ( Bathe-Peters et al., 2021 7.

Beta2-adrenergic receptor redistribution in heart failure changes cAMP compartmentation Science. 2010; 327 :1653-1657 Google Scholar ). Another example suggests that basal cAMP levels at the cell membrane may be higher than in the bulk cytosol and that low concentrations of agonists may be sufficient to trigger responses limited to the cell membrane ( Agarwal et al., 2014 2.

Such studies have given rise to the concept that compartmentation of cAMP signaling may describe the ability of cells to spatially separate different cAMP signals and, consequently, to trigger distinct downstream responses ( Langeberg and Scott, 2015 35.

For a long time, the concept of compartmentation appeared to be contradicted by observations that cAMP is essentially a freely diffusible second messenger ( Agarwal et al., 2016 1.

Intracellular tortuosity underlies slow cAMP diffusion in adult ventricular myocytes Cardiovasc. Res. 2016; 110 :395-407 Google Scholar ), which would preclude the formation of intracellular concentration gradients and subcellular compartments. However, recently we have shown that under basal conditions, cAMP is mostly bound to intracellular binding sites and that free diffusion only occurs once its levels are elevated well above the number of its binding sites ( Bock et al., 2020 11. Bock, A. ∙ Annibale, P. ∙ Konrad, C. ... Optical mapping of cAMP signaling at the nanometer scale Cell. 2020; 182 :1519-1530.e17 Google Scholar ). This is supported by the recent discovery of liquid-liquid phase separation of a regulatory protein kinase A subunit (PKA RIα) that sequesters cAMP ( Zhang et al., 2020 68. Zhang, J.Z. ∙ Lu, T.W. ∙ Stolerman, L.M. ... Phase separation of a PKA regulatory subunit controls cAMP compartmentation and oncogenic signaling Cell. 2020; 182 :1531-1544.e15 Google Scholar ). We have further shown that this leads to very low concentrations of free cAMP, which in turn allows cAMP phosphodiesterases (PDEs) to generate nanometer-size domains of even lower cAMP, where local cAMP targets are protected from cellular cAMP signals ( Bock et al., 2020 11. Bock, A. ∙ Annibale, P. ∙ Konrad, C. ... Optical mapping of cAMP signaling at the nanometer scale Cell. 2020; 182 :1519-1530.e17 Google Scholar ).
Along these lines, we reasoned that the existence of cAMP binding sites at micromolar concentrations might provide a mechanism to generate and shape cAMP signals triggered by receptor stimulation and might permit the formation of gradients of elevated cAMP concentrations around individual GPCRs. Such spatially limited cAMP gradients might in turn enable cells to specifically sense cAMP signals stemming from a particular GPCR and to propagate GPCR-specific cAMP signals to defined downstream functions.
We therefore set out to search for such domains of high cAMP concentrations associated with GPCRs. To do so, we investigated specifically two G s -coupled GPCRs: first, the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R), a receptor playing a key role in glucose metabolism and in diabetes therapy ( Drucker, 2018 19. Drucker, D.J. Mechanisms of action and therapeutic application of glucagon-like Peptide-1 Cell Metab. 2018; 27 :740-756 Google Scholar ; Drucker et al., 2017 20.

Invest. 2017; 127 :4217-4227 Google Scholar ) that responds to peptidic as well as nonpeptidic agonists ( Fletcher et al., 2016 22. Fletcher, M.M. ∙ Halls, M.L. ∙ Christopoulos, A. ...

Activation of the GLP-1 receptor by a non-peptidic agonist Nature. 2020; 577 :432-436 Google Scholar ). GLP-1Rs regulate insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cells via cAMP-dependent stimulation of PKA, and this effect appears to require cellular compartmentation of PKA via anchoring proteins ( Lester et al., 1997 37. Lester, L.B. ∙ Langeberg, L.K. ∙ Scott, J.D. Anchoring of protein kinase A facilitates hormone-mediated insulin secretion Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1997; 94 :14942-14947 Google Scholar ). In addition, we studied the β 2 -AR, the main receptor mediating the effects of epinephrine and norepinephrine, which has also been linked to compartment-dependent downstream effects ( Buxton and Brunton, 1983 14.

Beta2-adrenergic receptor redistribution in heart failure changes cAMP compartmentation Science. 2010; 327 :1653-1657 Google Scholar ).
We aimed to explore such domains by fusing a FRET-based cAMP biosensor to receptors with ruler-like spacers of defined nanometer length, to map cAMP levels at defined distances from the receptors. Finally, to show the relevance of such putative domains of high cAMP, we measured activation of downstream PKA with similarly targeted constructs to generate activity maps around individual GPCRs.

Section: Results

To provide direct evidence for the existence of putative cAMP compartments in the vicinity of individual GPCRs, we designed three different FRET-based cAMP biosensors. The first is GLP1R-camps that is composed of the human GLP-1R fused to the cAMP biosensor Epac1-camps ( Nikolaev et al., 2004 43. Nikolaev, V.O. ∙ Bünemann, M. ∙ Hein, L. ... Novel single chain cAMP sensors for receptor-induced signal propagation J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279 :37215-37218 Google Scholar ) ( Figure 1 ) to measure cAMP in the immediate vicinity of the GLP-1R. The second sensor, Epac1-camps-CAAX , was used to measure cAMP in the immediate vicinity of the cell membrane. And untargeted Epac1-camps served as a sensor for bulk cytosolic cAMP levels ( Figure 1 A).
The functionality and localization of the sensors were assessed in several control experiments ( Figures 1 A and S1 ). We showed that the sensors retained the functionalities of their parent components by demonstrating that (1) the GLP1R-camps sensor bound GLP-1-(7-36)-amide (from here on termed GLP-1) and stimulated whole-cell cAMP production with nanomolar potency similar to wild-type GLP-1R ( Figure S1 A), (2) upon stimulation with GLP-1, single HEK cells transiently expressing GLP1R-camps responded with a change in FRET ratio ( Figure S1 B), (3) this FRET change specifically indicated increases in cAMP, since a mutated construct GLP1R-camps-R279E , which does not bind cAMP, showed no FRET change in response to a variety of cAMP-increasing stimuli ( Figure S1 C), and (4) all three sensors ( GLP1R-camps , Epac1-camps-CAAX , and Epac1-camps ) had the same affinity for cAMP ( Figure S1 D). Finally, we confirmed that the three sensors displayed the expected subcellular distribution when expressed in HEK cells: confocal microscopy showed that the GLP1R-camps and Epac1-camps-CAAX were expressed at the cell membrane, while the untargeted Epac1-camps showed a ubiquitous cytosolic expression ( Figure 1 A).
To assess basal cAMP concentrations in the three compartments, we employed a previously developed calibration approach for cAMP determination in intact cells ( Börner et al., 2011 12. Börner, S. ∙ Schwede, F. ∙ Schlipp, A. ... FRET measurements of intracellular cAMP concentrations and cAMP analog permeability in intact cells Nat. Protoc. 2011; 6 :427-438 Google Scholar ) ( Figure 1 B). This approach uses inhibition of basal activity of adenylyl cyclase with MDL-12,330A to reach minimal levels of cAMP ( Figure 1 B; R MIN ). Addition of 100 μM of MDL-12,330A to cells expressing either of the three sensors resulted in quite distinct FRET responses: it strongly decreased cAMP levels at the GLP-1R and at the cell membrane in general ( Figure 1 C, orange and green traces, respectively), but much less in the bulk cytosol ( Figure 1 C, blue trace).
Saturation of all sensors was subsequently reached by application of the cell-permeable, specific Epac activator 8-Br-2′-O-Me-cAMP-AM, followed by inhibition of endogenous PDEs with IBMX, yielding FRET values for maximal cAMP signals ( Figures 1 B and 1C; R MAX ). Calculation of relative basal cAMP levels from appropriate calibration curves ( Börner et al., 2011 12. Börner, S. ∙ Schwede, F. ∙ Schlipp, A. ... FRET measurements of intracellular cAMP concentrations and cAMP analog permeability in intact cells Nat. Protoc. 2011; 6 :427-438 Google Scholar ) revealed that these levels were similar in the vicinity of GLP-1R and in the membrane compartment ( Figure 1 D and compare initial values in Figure 1 C), which is expected considering that GLP1R-camps is exclusively membrane-localized. Interestingly, cAMP levels appeared to be much lower for the cytosolic sensor Epac1-camps ( Figure 1 D). These data indicate that different basal cAMP concentrations may exist in different regions of a cell, with higher concentrations near the cell membrane than in bulk cytosol, confirming earlier notions of such differences ( Agarwal et al., 2014 2.

Rich, T.C. ∙ Xin, W. ∙ Mehats, C. ... Cellular mechanisms underlying prostaglandin-induced transient cAMP signals near the plasma membrane of HEK-293 cells Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2007; 292 :C319-C331 Google Scholar ).
To assess the cAMP dynamics in the different compartments at equal GLP-1R expression levels, we stimulated HEK cells with various concentrations of GLP-1 and monitored cAMP in the different compartments. To do so, cells were transfected with GLP1R-camps or bicistronic plasmids encoding either GLP-1R WT plus Epac1-camps-CAAX or GLP-1R WT plus Epac1-camps ( Figure 2 ).
Upon stimulation with GLP-1, single HEK cells transiently expressing GLP1R-camps responded with a change in FRET ratio ( Figures 2 B–2D). Interestingly, low GLP-1 (1 pM)—a concentration that hardly increased bulk cellular cAMP levels ( Figure S1 A)—led to a robust cAMP increase in the direct vicinity of GLP-1R ( Figure 2 B, orange). In contrast, 1 pM GLP-1 induced a significantly smaller increase in cAMP at the cell membrane ( Figure 2 B, green) and—in line with whole-cell cAMP data ( Figure S1 A)—showed virtually no cAMP increase in the cell cytosol ( Figure 2 B, blue). As all three sensors ( GLP1R-camps , Epac1-camps-CAAX , and Epac1-camps ) display the same affinity for cAMP ( Figure S1 D) and agonist-stimulated FRET responses are independent of sensors’ expression levels ( Figures S2 D and S2E), these data demonstrate that low concentrations of GLP-1 produce a local cAMP pool, which appears to be confined to the immediate vicinity of GLP-1 receptors and spatially distinct from other compartments of the cell. In addition, kinetic analysis indicated that cAMP concentrations increase faster directly at GLP-1 receptors than in the cell cytosol ( Figures S2 A–S2C).
Elevated GLP-1 concentrations (1 and 100 nM) saturated cAMP levels at the GLP-1R, the cell membrane, and in the cytosol and thereby, abolished these cAMP gradients ( Figures 2 C and 2D).
Our experiments show that stimulation of GLP1R-camps with its cognate agonist GLP-1 produces a receptor-associated cAMP pool, which, at low agonist concentrations, does not appear to spread to other cellular compartments on the timescale of our measurements (i.e., minutes) ( Figures 2 B–2D). Thus, cAMP that is produced inside this receptor-associated compartment is severely hindered in its ability to diffuse out of this compartment. We hypothesized that, reciprocally, cAMP from outside sources might be restricted in its ability to diffuse into the GLP-1 receptor-associated compartment. To provide experimental evidence for this hypothesis, we stimulated endogenous β 2 -ARs with the synthetic agonist isoproterenol (Iso) and measured cAMP within the GLP-1R-associated compartment using GLP1R-camps ( Figures 2 E–2G). Again, we used Epac1-camps-CAAX to measure cAMP at the cell membrane and untethered Epac1-camps to determine bulk cytosolic cAMP.
Stimulation of β 2 -ARs with low concentrations of Iso (10 pM) strongly increased cAMP levels at the cell membrane; however, the cAMP levels in the GLP-1R-associated compartment were significantly lower, and cytosolic cAMP remained unchanged ( Figure 2 E). Addition of 100 pM Iso caused a large cAMP response both at the cell membrane and in the cytosol. Interestingly, however, the increase in cAMP levels in the GLP-1R-associated compartment remained significantly lower ( Figure 2 F). Higher Iso concentrations (10 nM) led to the same relative cAMP increase in all three compartments and thus dissipated the observed cAMP gradients ( Figure 2 G). Our data suggest that, similar to GLP-1Rs, stimulation of β 2 -ARs produced at least three spatially segregated pools of cAMP. However, the order in which these compartments show increases in cAMP is different: first, cAMP levels increase at the cell membrane, then in the bulk cytosol, and finally in the GLP-1R-associated compartment. These findings contrast with those measured upon GLP-1R stimulation, in which we first observed an increase in the GLP-1R-associated compartment, then at the cell membrane, and finally in the cytosol ( Figures 2 B–2D).
Together, these data strongly argue for the existence of distinct receptor-associated cAMP pools within a single cell that are spatially segregated and under the control of individual GPCRs. Stimulation of a given receptor would thereby increase cAMP initially in its own immediate compartment (and not affect the compartments of other receptors), followed by an increase of cAMP in the cell membrane compartment and finally, in the cytosol. Importantly, at low GLP-1 concentrations, cAMP gradients remain stable (i.e., the concentrations remain highest at the receptor), and cAMP levels between different compartments do not equilibrate.
We hypothesized that the size of receptor-associated compartments needs to be very small for a cell to organize signaling inputs from many GPCRs simultaneously with sufficient spatial separation. To provide direct values for the size of such compartments in intact cells, we set out to precisely map the dimensions of these receptor-associated cAMP compartments. To do so, we developed a set of tools where the Epac1-camps sensor is placed at defined distances from the GLP-1R. To achieve these defined distances, we used genetically encodable single-alpha-helical (SAH) domain linkers based on ER/K repeats ( Bock et al., 2020 11. Bock, A. ∙ Annibale, P. ∙ Konrad, C. ... Optical mapping of cAMP signaling at the nanometer scale Cell. 2020; 182 :1519-1530.e17 Google Scholar ; Sivaramakrishnan and Spudich, 2011 56. Sivaramakrishnan, S. ∙ Spudich, J.A. Systematic control of protein interaction using a modular ER/K alpha-helix linker Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108 :20467-20472 Google Scholar ). SAH linkers have been shown to have a size range in nanometers and a rod-like shape that allows us to position two proteins at defined distances from each other.
Based on such linkers, we generated GPCR nanorulers by placing a 30 nm SAH linker (SAH30) derived from a Kelch-motif family protein from Trichomonas vaginalis , or a tandem spacer of two such domains, between the GLP-1R and Epac1-camps to create GLP1R-SAH30-camps or GLP1R-SAH60-camps , respectively ( Table S1 ). These constructs should, therefore, measure cAMP levels at 30 or 60 nm distance from the receptor in real time and in intact cells. To verify that the SAH linkers did indeed result in the predicted spacing, we generated a reference construct, which was a membrane-localized version of SAH60 sandwiched between two HaloTags fluorescently labeled with Halo JF-646 ( Figure S3 A). We performed direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) in fixed cells expressing the labeled construct ( Figures 3 A and S3 ). Analysis of the frequency distribution demonstrated that the most abundant molecules had a length of 60 nm (peak of distribution at 69 nm) ( Figures S3 B and S3C) and, thus, confirmed that an individual SAH30 linker is approximately 30 nm long. Moreover, we confirmed that the GPCR nanorulers were expressed at similar expression levels ( Figure S3 D), had the same potency for stimulating cAMP production as wild-type GLP-1R ( Figure S3 E), and had the same affinity for cAMP as Epac1-camps ( Figure S3 F).
Stimulation of HEK cells with 1 pM GLP-1—a concentration that robustly increased cAMP within the GLP-1R-associated compartment but virtually not in the cytosol ( Figure 2 )—led to a significantly smaller relative FRET change in cells expressing GLP1R-SAH30-camps compared with GLP1R-camps ( Figure 3 B). As the affinities of the two sensors for cAMP are equal ( Figure S3 F), these data demonstrate that the cAMP levels at 30 nm distance from the receptor are significantly lower than in its direct vicinity ( Figures 3 B and 3E). However, the cAMP concentrations measured with GLP1R-SAH30-camps were significantly higher than in the cell cytosol ( Figures 3 B and 3E), suggesting that the GLP-1R-associated cAMP compartment has a dimension of more than 30 nm.
To measure cAMP beyond the 30 nm distance, we stimulated HEK cells expressing the longer GLP1R-SAH60-camps nanoruler with 1 pM GLP-1. This resulted in significantly smaller relative FRET changes than those seen with GLP1R-SAH30-camps and GLP1R-camps ( Figures 3 B and 3E) and which were only slightly, albeit significantly, larger than the signals measured in the cytosol ( Figures 3 B and 3E). This suggests that the GLP-1R-associated cAMP pool has a diameter of approximately 60 nm. Given the dimensions of these receptor-associated cAMP pools, we propose to term them receptor-associated independent cAMP nanodomains (RAINs) .
To assess how these domains change upon stronger stimulation of the receptors, we performed similar experiments with 1 nM GLP-1 ( Figure 3 C). Interestingly, at these higher concentrations, differences in FRET ratios at 0, 30, and 60 nm distance from the receptor were no longer visible, indicating that the cAMP gradients seen with 1 pM GLP-1 were abolished ( Figures 3 C and 3F).
As the GLP-1 RAINs are protected from cAMP generated by β 2 -ARs ( Figure 2 E), we wondered whether the GLP1R nanorulers , i.e., GLP1R-SAH60-camps and GLP1R-SAH30-camps , would sense this “foreign” cAMP earlier than GLP1R-camps . To test this hypothesis, we expressed all three constructs at similar levels and stimulated endogenous β 2 -AR in HEK cells with 10 pM Iso ( Figure 3 D). In line with our hypothesis, GLP1R-SAH60-camps detected a significantly larger cAMP increase than GLP1R-SAH30-camps and GLP1R-camps did ( Figures 3 D and 3G). These data demonstrate that GLP-1R cAMP nanodomains are gradually protected from cAMP generated by other receptors and, thus, further support the existence and size of RAINs.
PDEs have repeatedly been suggested to contribute to the compartmentation of cAMP ( Baillie, 2009 5. Baillie, G.S.

Physiol. 2012; 302 :H379-H390 Google Scholar ). We have demonstrated recently that this is due to the fact that under basal physiological conditions, most cAMP is not freely diffusible but bound to specific sites, which results in free cAMP low enough for individual PDEs to shape cAMP concentration gradients ( Bock et al., 2020 11. Bock, A. ∙ Annibale, P. ∙ Konrad, C. ... Optical mapping of cAMP signaling at the nanometer scale Cell. 2020; 182 :1519-1530.e17 Google Scholar ). Therefore, we tested whether endogenous PDEs might have a role in shaping RAINs. Pretreatment with the global PDE inhibitor IBMX (100 μM) alone led to different FRET changes in the direct vicinity of the GLP-1R and at 30 and 60 nm distances from the receptors. This suggests that PDE activity may have different consequences at certain nanometer distances from the receptor ( Figures 4 A and 4B). Interestingly, IBMX pretreatment abolished the differences in cAMP levels directly at the GLP-1R versus at 30 and 60 nm distance upon stimulation with 1 pM GLP-1 ( Figure 4 C). These data suggest that localized PDE activity is a key factor in shaping the size of RAINs.
The observations that cAMP levels are higher in the immediate vicinity of a GPCR and that these domains are somewhat protected from the influx of cAMP generated at other receptors can only be explained if cAMP is not freely diffusible at these sites. We have recently discovered that cytosolic cAMP under basal conditions is buffered by binding to specific binding proteins, such as protein kinase A (PKA) ( Bock et al., 2020 11. Bock, A. ∙ Annibale, P. ∙ Konrad, C. ... Optical mapping of cAMP signaling at the nanometer scale Cell. 2020; 182 :1519-1530.e17 Google Scholar ). To assess whether similar mechanisms might account for the formation of cAMP gradients around GPCRs, we investigated whether local cAMP-buffering sites exist within these RAINs. We used the FRET-based PKA activity reporter AKAR4 ( Depry et al., 2011 17. Depry, C. ∙ Allen, M.D. ∙ Zhang, J. Visualization of PKA activity in plasma membrane microdomains Mol. Biosyst. 2011; 7 :52-58 Google Scholar ), which reports on endogenous PKA activity upon phosphorylation of its intrinsic PKA substrate. By fusing AKAR4 to the C terminus of the GLP-1R, we generated the sensor ( GLP1R-AKAR4 ) to test for endogenous PKA activity inside RAINs ( Figure 5 A). We confirmed that GLP1R-AKAR4 stimulated cAMP production as efficiently as GLP-1 wild-type receptors and that AKAR4 sensed PKA phosphorylation equally well independent of being tethered to GLP-1R ( GLP1R-AKAR ) or expressed in the cytosol ( Figures S4 A and S4B). Moreover, confocal microscopy of cells expressing GLP1R-AKAR4 confirmed that it was appropriately localized at the cell membrane ( Figure 5 A, left lower panel). As a control for whole-cell PKA activity, we expressed separately but stoichiometrically GLP-1R and AKAR4 , which leads to whole-cell expression of AKAR4 ( Figure 5 A, right lower panel).
Stimulation with 1 pM GLP-1—the concentration that had increased cAMP within the GLP-1R-associated compartment but virtually not in the cytosol ( Figure 2 )—led to a strong, almost saturating increase in FRET ratio of the GLP1R-AKAR4 sensor, indicating strong PKA activity inside RAINs ( Figure 5 B, orange trace). In contrast, the same GLP-1 concentration promoted only very little PKA activity in the cytosol ( Figure 5 B, blue trace). As before, no such differences were visible at higher GLP-1 concentrations (1 nM); under these conditions, PKA was fully activated both in RAINs and in the cytosol ( Figure 5 C).
PKA is tethered to molecular signaling complexes by A-kinase-anchoring proteins (AKAPs) ( Langeberg and Scott, 2015 35. Langeberg, L.K. ∙ Scott, J.D. Signalling scaffolds and local organization of cellular behaviour Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2015; 16 :232-244 Google Scholar ; Scott and Pawson, 2009 55. Scott, J.D. ∙ Pawson, T. Cell signaling in space and time: where proteins come together and when they're apart Science. 2009; 326 :1220-1224 Google Scholar ; Taylor et al., 2012 62. Taylor, S.S. ∙ Ilouz, R. ∙ Zhang, P. ...

AKAP signalling complexes: Focal points in space and time Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5 :959-970 Google Scholar ). This provides a means for cells to localize PKA activity to defined macromolecular signaling complexes at specific cellular locations, thereby exerting spatial control over PKA activity. Strikingly, when HEK cells expressing GLP1R-AKAR4 were pretreated with St-Ht31, a peptide that disrupts protein-protein interactions between regulatory subunits of PKA and AKAPs, PKA activity in RAINs was entirely lost even upon stimulation with 1 nM GLP-1 ( Figure 5 D). Remarkably, disrupting AKAP/PKA interactions had no effect on cytosolic PKA activity under the same stimulation conditions ( Figure 5 D). As expected, pretreatment with the respective inactive control peptide St-Ht31-P had no effect on PKA activity inside RAINs ( Figure 5 E). These data unequivocally demonstrate the presence of localized PKA activity that is tethered to RAINs. Moreover, these data suggest that RAINs constitute self-sufficient and independent signaling units in which local generation of cAMP by GLP-1 is directly translated into local PKA activity. Of note, since disruption of PKA tethering completely abolished GLP-1R nanodomain signaling, it is necessary that PKA molecules have to be located inside the GLP-1R nanodomain. This indicates that diffusion of other PKA molecules from outside into these GLP-1R nanodomains does not occur or, at least, does not promote phosphorylation of PKA substrates tethered to the GLP-1 receptor.
We have shown above that β 2 -AR-mediated cAMP stimulation leads to significantly higher cAMP increases at the cell membrane than in the direct vicinity of GLP-1 receptors ( Figure 2 E). Furthermore, we have demonstrated that GLP-1Rs are protected in a gradual manner from cAMP generated by β 2 -AR activation ( Figures 3 D and 3G). These data suggest that β 2 -ARs may, in analogy to GLP-1Rs, also generate cAMP nanodomains.
To provide direct evidence for RAINs at β 2 -AR, we designed and cloned β 2 AR-camps , a biosensor consisting of the human wild-type β 2 -AR fused to Epac1-camps ( Figure 6 ). β 2 AR-camps functions like wild-type β 2 -AR with respect to cAMP production ( Figure S5 A) and shows correct membrane localization ( Figure 6 B). Stimulation of HEK-AD cells that expressed β 2 AR-camps or a bicistronic plasmid encoding β 2 -AR plus Epac1-camps-CAAX or Epac1-camps at similar expression levels ( Figure S5 B), with very low concentrations of Iso (1 pM) led to significantly larger cAMP increases at the β 2 -AR and at the cell membrane than in the cytosol ( Figure 6 C). In contrast to GLP-1Rs, we did not observe differences in the cAMP levels at the β 2 -AR and the cell membrane, which is presumably due to the fact that the endogenous β 2 -ARs expressed in HEK cells (albeit at much lower levels) lead to cAMP elevations in the entire membrane compartment ( Figure 6 C). At higher concentrations of Iso (10 pM), cAMP nanodomains are maintained, but cAMP levels increase in all compartments, which may indicate the beginning of cAMP nanodomain dissipation ( Figure 6 D).
Taken together, these data demonstrate that also β 2 -ARs form RAINs, which suggests that RAINs may be a general phenomenon of GPCRs.
We have shown that GPCRs generate RAINs that stretch over several tens of nanometers and are protected from cAMP influxes produced by different GPCRs. The differences in cAMP concentrations in different compartments ( Figure 2 ) and at nanometer distances from the receptor at steady state ( Figure 3 B) are remarkable. We were wondering how these cAMP concentration profiles may be described in quantitative terms.
In the absence of any mechanism that restricts cAMP diffusion dynamics, the cAMP concentration profiles would be dictated by free diffusion and, thus, of hyperbolic nature. At low agonist occupancies (i.e., 1 pM GLP-1), one can assume that the distance between individual, ligand-bound receptors is much larger than the radius of RAINs, and, thus, at 1 pM GLP-1 stimulation, we consider isolated cAMP concentration profiles under the control of a single active GLP-1R ( Methods S1 ; for graphical illustration, see Figure 7 ). Assuming a constant cAMP diffusion coefficient within RAINs and constant PDE activity in the cytosol, the solution of the stationary reaction-diffusion equation ( Methods S1 for delineation of formulas [ Bentele and Falcke, 2007 9. Bentele, K. ∙ Falcke, M. Quasi-steady approximation for ion channel currents Biophys. J. 2007; 93 :2597-2608 Google Scholar ; Martiel and Goldbeter, 1987 40. Martiel, J.L. ∙ Goldbeter, A. A model based on receptor desensitization for cyclic AMP signaling in Dictyostelium cells Biophys. J. 1987; 52 :807-828 Google Scholar ; Violin et al., 2008 64. Violin, J.D. ∙ DiPilato, L.M. ∙ Yildirim, N. ... Beta2-adrenergic receptor signaling and desensitization elucidated by quantitative modeling of real time cAMP dynamics J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283 :2949-2961 Google Scholar ]) indicates that increases of cAMP concentrations in the direct vicinity of receptors should dissipate away from the receptors according to a simple 1/r dependency until they reach the cAMP levels of the bulk cytosol.
Based on the data in Figures 3 B and 3E, we calculated the increases in cAMP concentrations at the GLP-1R, at 30 and 60 nm distance and in the bulk cytosol upon stimulation with 1 pM GLP-1 ( Figure 7 B, magenta). Fitting cAMP levels at the receptor and the cytosol ( Equation 1 in STAR Methods ) strikingly revealed that cAMP concentrations at 30 nm distance (and less so at 60 nm distance) from the receptor are much higher than predicted from a 1/r dependency and thereby cannot be explained by simple diffusion and constant cytosolic PDE activities alone ( Figure 7 B; Methods S1 ).
At higher agonist concentrations (i.e., 1 nM GLP-1, Figures 3 C and 3F), cAMP increases much more at both 30 and 60 nm distances, and cAMP nanodomains appear to broaden (note that at 1 nM GLP-1 Δ[cAMP] is equal at GLP-1R and at 30-nm distance, Figure 7 B, blue). Given the much higher receptor occupancy at this agonist concentration and, therefore, a reduced distance between individual active receptors, isolated cAMP concentration profiles can no longer be assumed; instead, the concentration profiles are expected to become more complex in this situation (cf. Equation 2 in Methods S1 ). In any case, also at high GLP-1 concentrations, it is obvious that increases in cAMP at the receptor do not get smaller in space as would be expected for simple diffusion and constant cytosolic PDE activities ( Figure 7 B).
Thus, at both low and high agonist concentrations, our data are not compatible with a simple diffusion model for cAMP but instead would be in line with buffered diffusion of cAMP ( Bock et al., 2020 11. Bock, A. ∙ Annibale, P. ∙ Konrad, C. ... Optical mapping of cAMP signaling at the nanometer scale Cell. 2020; 182 :1519-1530.e17 Google Scholar ), along with cAMP trapping by local molecular crowding or formation of biomolecular condensates ( Zhang et al., 2020 68. Zhang, J.Z. ∙ Lu, T.W. ∙ Stolerman, L.M. ... Phase separation of a PKA regulatory subunit controls cAMP compartmentation and oncogenic signaling Cell. 2020; 182 :1531-1544.e15 Google Scholar ). Together with differentially localized PDE activity, these mechanisms appear to allow the formation of RAINs where very local effects of cAMP occur. Figure 7 B shows that these RAINs broaden at higher agonist concentrations and ultimately dissipate to lead to increases in bulk cytosolic cAMP, which stimulates cAMP effects throughout a cell.

Section: Discussion

Mapping cAMP gradients around individual GPCRs, we have identified RAINs in intact cells. Low agonist concentrations produce a localized receptor-associated cAMP pool that extends up to 60 nm from the receptor. This cAMP pool directly translates into localized, receptor-associated PKA activity and, hence, constitutes a self-sufficient and independent signaling unit. The required presence of PKA regulatory subunits inside RAINs suggests the requirement for localized binding and buffering of cAMP, which would keep the cAMP local and, moreover, enables localized PDEs to shape the size of GPCR-associated independent cAMP nanodomains. Experiments with the β 2 -AR showed similar localized cAMP responses to low levels of stimulation and suggest that RAINs may be a general phenomenon of GPCRs.
Our data suggest that cells may use these RAINs to spatially limit distinct cAMP signals stemming from different GPCRs. This is based on three main findings. First, cAMP concentrations inside RAINs do not equilibrate with cytosolic cAMP over minutes. Second, cAMP pools generated by β 2 -ARs do not equilibrate with the cAMP pool inside the GLP-1R nanodomains; i.e., RAINs are protected from (low levels of) stimulation of other GPCRs. Third, disruption of PKA tethering inside RAINs abolishes the signaling function of this individual unit. We propose that by organizing extracellular GPCR stimuli into RAINs, cells are able to precisely sense which cAMP pool stems from which GPCR. Cells would thereby be capable of orchestrating distinct cAMP pools simultaneously and, ultimately, of relaying them into receptor-specific cell function with high spatial precision.
These findings have important implications for our understanding of GPCR signaling via cAMP. Traditionally, cAMP has been regarded as a freely diffusible messenger and, thus, would increase (or decrease) uniformly within an entire cell upon stimulation of adenylyl cyclase-linked GPCRs. This would mean that cAMP would allow cells to operate only as a single switch, being turned on or off via uniform cellular cAMP levels. However, we have shown recently that under physiological conditions cellular cAMP is largely bound and not freely diffusible ( Bock et al., 2020 11. Bock, A. ∙ Annibale, P. ∙ Konrad, C. ... Optical mapping of cAMP signaling at the nanometer scale Cell. 2020; 182 :1519-1530.e17 Google Scholar ), which would allow the formation of cAMP gradients. In line with this, we show here the existence of very small, independent cAMP signaling nanodomains around each individual GPCR. This indicates a huge number of cellular switches—with essentially each single GPCR representing one such unit—enlarging the complexity of cAMP signaling by orders of magnitude. Using an analogy from electronics, this would suggest that cAMP signaling of a cell does not represent a single transistor-like switch but rather a chip comprising a large number of independent but interacting switches.
The possible number of such individual cAMP “switches” at the cell surface can be roughly estimated if we consider that the RAIN’s radius appears to be on the order of 60 nm; that is, their diameter about 120 nm. In order to assure a “safe” distance between individual switches, they may be placed at distances of ≈200 nm, i.e., at a density of ≈25/μm 2 . Considering that most cells have a surface area of several hundred μm 2 , this would allow for several thousand independent cAMP “switches.”
The molecular details of how such RAINs are shaped remain to be elucidated. Our data suggest at least two possible mechanisms. The first one is a marked reduction of the cAMP diffusion coefficient over a range of a few tens of nanometers from the receptor, which might be brought about by buffered diffusion combined with molecular crowding or formation of biomolecular condensates ( Bock et al., 2020 11. Bock, A. ∙ Annibale, P. ∙ Konrad, C. ... Optical mapping of cAMP signaling at the nanometer scale Cell. 2020; 182 :1519-1530.e17 Google Scholar ; Zhang et al., 2020 68. Zhang, J.Z. ∙ Lu, T.W. ∙ Stolerman, L.M. ... Phase separation of a PKA regulatory subunit controls cAMP compartmentation and oncogenic signaling Cell. 2020; 182 :1531-1544.e15 Google Scholar ). The second mechanism is substantially higher PDE concentrations close to receptors compared with the bulk cytosol, a mechanism that would be in line with our data showing that PDE inhibition is highly dependent on the distance from the receptor, suggesting differentially localized PDE activity ( Figure 4 ).
The exact composition of RAINs, i.e., which proteins contribute to them, how they are organized, and whether they are stable or dynamic, also remains to be studied. While our data indicate that AKAPs, PKA, and PDEs are necessary constituents, other proteins may well contribute to the individual properties of individual RAINs.
Our model ( Figure 7 A) further suggests that upon stronger stimulation, the concentrations of cAMP begin to overcome the local PDE capacity, as well as the buffering capacity, for cAMP. This would increase the concentrations of free, diffusible cAMP and thereby cause dissipation and progressive fusion of the individual RAINs, ultimately resulting in generalized increases of cAMP throughout a cell, which allows generalized activation of cAMP targets, including changes in gene transcription via cAMP response elements—processes that would appear to be unrelated to complex signaling via individual RAINs.
The level of receptor stimulation required to overcome RAINs should depend on a number of parameters. For example, a comparison of cytosolic cAMP signals induced by low levels of endogenous β 2 -ARs in HEK cells and those seen upon overexpression of β 2 -ARs illustrates that receptor levels have a strong impact (compare, e.g., Figures 2 E and 6 D). Likewise, the agonist concentration affects not only the amplitude but also the kinetics of cAMP signals in the different compartments (compare, e.g., Figure 3 B and 3C). Levels of other protein components inside RAINs, such as PDEs and AKAPs, will also very significantly contribute to their size, shape, and function.
Taken together, our study reveals mechanisms of how cells can independently process large numbers of receptor signals by spatially restricting cAMP in nanometer-size RAINs. Localized cAMP signaling has been suggested by a number of studies to be important for normal cell homeostasis and function. As a consequence, a disruption of localized cAMP signaling has been proposed to be associated with various diseases ( Bers et al., 2019 10. Bers, D.M. ∙ Xiang, Y.K. ∙ Zaccolo, M.

Phase separation of a PKA regulatory subunit controls cAMP compartmentation and oncogenic signaling Cell. 2020; 182 :1531-1544.e15 Google Scholar ). Our data reveal the molecular mechanisms of how such localized cAMP signaling by individual GPCRs is brought about. They further suggest that modulation of individual RAIN signaling may hold therapeutic potential.
Our study demonstrates the existence of RAINs for two GPCRs—the class B GLP-1R and the class A β 2 -AR. It will be important to study, whether similar principles apply to other GPCRs, notably not only to G s -coupled receptors that increase cAMP but also those triggering other signaling pathways. In addition, the cells being investigated are relatively simple cell culture lines, and it will be most interesting to see how cells with a more complex architecture, such as neurons or cardiomyocytes, may organize such signaling nanodomains. For example, it may be expected that individual RAINs will fuse at postsynaptic sites and that they may be unevenly distributed in cells where receptor distribution is not uniform, such as cardiomyocytes ( Bathe-Peters et al., 2021 7. Bathe-Peters, M. ∙ Gmach, P. ∙ Boltz, H.H. ... Visualization of beta-adrenergic receptor dynamics and differential localization in cardiomyocytes Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2021; 118 e2101119118 Google Scholar ). It will be important to see how stable RAINs may be, i.e., if they change over time, both short and long term, and how the mobility of receptors and signaling proteins ( Möller et al., 2020 41.

Single-molecule imaging reveals receptor-G protein interactions at cell surface hot spots Nature. 2017; 550 :543-547 Google Scholar ) may affect the shape and function of RAINs. And finally, it will be important to determine more accurately the stimulus strengths that lead to the formation and dissipation of the cAMP gradients that form RAINs.

HEK-tsA201 (ECACC 96121229, Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH, referred to as HEK cells throughout the manuscript), HEK-293AD (AD-100-GVO-CB, BioCat GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany, referred to as HEK-AD cells throughout the manuscript) and CHO-K1 cells (CCL-61™, ATCC, Teddington, UK, referred to as CHO cells throughout the manuscript) were cultured in complete DMEM with 4.5 g/L glucose (PAN Biotech, Aidenbach, Germany), or DMEM/Ham’s F12 (Life Technologies GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany) respectively, both supplemented with 10 %(v/v) fetal bovine serum (Biochrom GmbH, Berlin, Germany), 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin (Pen/Strep, GIBCO Life technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and 2 mM L-glutamine (PAN Biotech, Aidenbach, Germany) at 37 °C and 5 % CO 2 . Cells were passaged in T75 flasks every 2-4 days when reaching a confluency of 80-90 %. Cells were routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination using MycoAlert™ Mycoplasma Detection Kit from Lonza (Basel, Switzerland). Cell lines were not contaminated with mycoplasma.
For fluorescence microscopy experiments, HEK cells and HEK-AD cells (used for β 2 -AR biosensors) were seeded on Poly-D-Lysine-coated 24 mm glass cover slips in 6-well plates and transfected with 300-600 ng cDNA per cover slip using Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) as follows: for transfection of one well of a 6-well plate, 300-600 ng cDNA was mixed with 66 μL buffer EC and 3.2 μL Enhancer and was incubated for 2 min. 7 μL Effectene transfection reagent was added and the mixture was incubated for 20 min at room temperature. After addition of 350 μL prewarmed cell culture medium, 400 μL of the mixture was added dropwise to the cells. Culture medium was renewed 24 h after transfection. Fluorescence microscopy experiments were performed 24-48 h ( GLP1R-camps, GLP1R-IRES2-Epac1-camps, GLP1R-IRES2-Epac1-camps-CAAX, GLP1R-AKAR4 , GLP1R-IRES2-AKAR4, β 2 AR-camps, β 2 AR-IRES2-Epac1-camps, β 2 AR-IRES2-Epac1-camps-CAAX, Epac1-camps , and Epac1-camps-CAAX ) or 64-72 h ( GLP1R-SAH30-camps and GLP1R-SAH60-camps ) after transfection.
For sensor calibration experiments, CHO cells were seeded on uncoated cover slips into 6-well plates and transfected with 2 μg cDNA per cover slip using FuGENE HD transfection reagent (Promega) at a 3:1 ratio. cDNA was mixed with Opti-MEM and FuGENE HD transfection reagent was added. The mixture was incubated for 12 min at room temperature before it was added to the cells. 24 h after transfection culture medium was renewed and fluorescence microscopy experiments were conducted 48 h post transfection.
For dSTORM imaging, CHO cells were seeded the night before on uncoated cover slips into 6-well plates. 12-14 h after seeding, cells were transfected with 2 μg cDNA per cover slip using Lipofectamine™ 2000. The conditions for one well of a 6-well plate are as follows: 2 μg of cDNA and 6 μL Lipofectamine™ 2000 transfection reagent were each mixed separately with 500 μL Opti-MEM, incubated for 5 min at room temperature before being combined. The transfection mixture was incubated for 20 min at room temperature. During incubation the cells were washed twice with PBS and kept in phenol red-free DMEM/F12 medium with 10 % FCS with no antibiotics. The transfection mixture was added to each well. 4-5 h after transfection cells were labelled and fixed. dSTORM experiments were conducted on the same day or 24 h later.
For cAMP determinations by ELISA, HEK cells were seeded at a density of 2.5 x 10 5 cells/well into 6 well plates and left to adhere overnight. Cells were transfected with either wild-type GLP-1R or GLP1R-camps using a calcium phosphate transfection protocol (3 μg cDNA, 3 μg empty pcDNA3, 125 mM CaCl 2 , 25 mM N,N-bis[2-hydroxyethyl]-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid, 140 mM NaCl, 0.75 mM Na 2 HPO 4 x 2 H 2 O, pH=6.95 adjusted at 20°C) incubation for 20 min, adding to the cells). 24 h after transfection culture medium was renewed.
For HTRF experiments to determine cAMP accumulation by GLP-1R biosensors, HEK cells were seeded at a density of 1.3 x 10 6 cells into a 6 cm dish and left to adhere overnight. Cells were transfected after 24 h with 6 μg of cDNA using Lipofectamine™ 3000 (Invitrogen™). Briefly, 6 μg cDNA was mixed with 12 μL P3000 reagent and 300 μL Opti-MEM (i.e. mix 1). 18 μL of Lipofectamine™ 3000 was mixed with 300 μL Opti-MEM (i.e. mix 2). Mix 1 and mix 2 were vortexed and combined to get the final solution and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. The final transfection mix was added dropwise to the cells. On the next day medium was renewed.
For HTRF experiments to determine cAMP accumulation by β 2 -AR biosensors, CHO cells were seeded at a density of 4 x 10 5 cells/well into a 6-well plate and left to adhere overnight. Cells were transfected after 24 h with 2 μg of cDNA using Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen™). Cells were washed twice with prewarmed PBS and prewarmed cell culture medium without antibiotics was added. Per well of a six-well plate 2 mixtures were prepared. In one tube 150 μL Opti-MEM (reduced serum medium, no phenol red (Gibco™)) was mixed with 2 μg cDNA, in another tube 150 μL Opti-MEM was mixed with 3.75 μL Lipofectamine™ 2000. Both mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 5 min and were combined afterwards. After another 10 min incubation 300 μL of this mixture was added dropwise to the cells. 6 h after transfection medium was renewed.
For PKA phosphorylation assays using AKAR4 biosensors, HEK cells were seeded at a density of 1.3 x 10 6 into a 6 cm dish and left to adhere overnight. Cells were transfected after 24 h with 1.5 μg cDNA using Effectene transfection reagent. Briefly, 150 μL buffer EC was mixed with 1.5 μg cDNA. 12 μL Enhancer was added and the mix was vortexed and incubated for 3 min. 24 μL Effectene was added, mixed and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. The solution was added dropwise to the cells. On the next day medium was renewed.
All cAMP sensor constructs were cloned into pcDNA3. The cDNA for the wild-type human GLP-1R (a kind gift from Dr. Christoph Klenk, University of Zürich, Switzerland) was cloned in frame into a vector containing EYFP using HindIII and XbaI to generate GLP-1R-EYFP. To insert restriction sites for BmtI and BspEI between the GLP-1R and EYFP as well as restriction sites for EcoRI and NotI at the C terminus of EYFP, the following primers were used to amplify EYFP (#1: forward: 5′- AAA TCT AGA GCT AGC GGG TCC GGA GTG AGC AAG GGC GAG GAG - 3′; #2: reverse 5′- AAA AGC GGC CGC AAA GAA TTC CTT GTA CAG CTC GTC CAT - 3′ priming sequence underlined, restriction sites in italics). In the following step Epac1(E157-E316)-CFP was cloned in frame into GLP-1R-EYFP using EcoRI and NotI thereby creating GLP1R-Epac1-camps . GLP1R-camps-R279E was generated by replacing Epac1(E157-E316)-CFP in GLP1R-camps with (Epac1(E157-E317[R279E])-CFP) using EcoRI and NotI. The 30 nm ER/K linker (a kind gift from Dr. Sivaraj Sivaramakrishnan, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, USA) and 60 nm ER/K linker (synthesized by Eurofins genomics, Ebersberg, Germany) were inserted between GLP-1R and Epac1-camps using restriction enzymes BmtI and BspEI. Epac1-camps-CAAX was generated starting from Epac2-camps-CAAX . CFP-CAAX was cut out using XbaI and XhoI and inserted into Epac1-camps instead of the original CFP.
AKAR 4 was a kind gift from Dr. Jin Zhang, University of California San Diego, USA. GLP1R-AKAR4 and GLP1R-IRES2-AKAR4 were generated by Gibson cloning ( Gibson et al., 2009 24. Gibson, D.G. ∙ Young, L. ∙ Chuang, R.Y. ... Enzymatic assembly of DNA molecules up to several hundred kilobases Nat. Methods. 2009; 6 :343-345 Google Scholar ). For GLP1R-AKAR4 the insert GLP-1R was PCR amplified using a pair of primers (#3: forward: 5′- CCC AAG CTT GCG GCC GCC ACC ATG GCC GGC GCC CCC GGC - 3′, #4: reverse: 5′ - GCT CAC CAT GGG ATC CTT ATC TCC GGA CCC GCT AGC TCT AGA - 3′), and inserted upstream of AKAR4 in its vector (#5: forward: 5′ - TCT AGA GCT AGC GGG TCC GGA GAT AAG GAT CCC ATG GTG AGC – 3′, #6: reverse: 5′ - CGG GCC GGG GGC GCC GG C CAT GGT GGC GGC CGC AAG CTT - 3′). For GLP1R-IRES2 - AKAR4 an IRES2 sequence was PCR amplified as an insert using indicated primers (#7: forward: 5′ - AGA GCT AGC GGG TCC GGA TAA GCC CCT CTC CCT CCC - 3′, #8: reverse: 5′ - CTC GCC CTT GCT CAC CAT TGT GGC CAT ATT ATC ATC - 3′). IRES2 was then inserted between GLP-1R and AKAR4 in the construct GLP1R-AKAR4 (#9: forward: 5′ - GAT GAT AAT ATG GCC ACA ATG GTG AGC AAG GGC GAG - 3′, #10: reverse: 5′ - GGG AGG GAG AGG GGC TTA TCC GGA CCC GCT AGC TCT - 3′).
For GLP1R-IRES2-Epac1-camps and GLP1R-IRES2-Epac1-camps-CAAX , the sequence encoding GLP1R-IRES2 from the template GLP1R-IRES2-AKAR4 was PCR amplified using indicated primers (#11: forward: 5′ – CTC ACT ATA GGG AGA CCC AAG CTT ATG GCC GGC GCC CCC GGC CCG CTG – 3′, #12: reverse: 5′ – CAG CTC CTC GCC CTT GCT CAC CAT TGT GGC CAT ATT ATC ATC GTG TTT – 3′). GLP1R-IRES2 was then inserted upstream of Epac1-camps or Epac1-camps-CAAX in its respective vector (#13: forward: 5′ - AAA CAC GAT GAT AAT ATG GCC ACA ATG GTG AGC AAG GGC GAG GAG CTG – 3′, #14: reverse: 5′ – CAG CGG GCC GGG GGC GCC GGC CAT AAG CTT GGG TCT CCC TAT AGT GAG – 3′). To generate β 2 AR-camps , in a first step, the upstream haemagglutinin signal peptide and downstream BmtI and BspEI restriction sites were inserted into a human β 2 -AR wild-type sequence by PCR amplification and Gibson cloning using indicated primers (#15: forward: 5′ - ATA GGG AGA CCC AAG CTT ATG AAG ACC ATC ATC GCC CTG AGC TAC ATC TTC TGC CTG GTG TTC GCC ATG GGG CAA CCC GGG AAC – 3′, #16: reverse: 5′ – AAA TCC GGA CCC GCT AGC CAG CAG TGA GTC ATT TGT -3′). In a second step, this β 2 -AR sequence was inserted into the GLP1R-camps template – where it replaced the GLP-1R wild-type sequence – using restriction enzyme cloning.
To clone β 2 AR-IRES2-Epac1-camps and β 2 AR-IRES2-Epac1-camps-CAAX , the β 2 -AR sequence was PCR amplified using indicated primers (#17: forward: 5′ – CTC ACT ATA GGG AGA CCC AAG CTT ATG AAG ACC ATC ATC GCC CTG AGC – 3′, #18: reverse: 5′ – TAG GGG GGG GGG AGG GAG AGG GGC TTA TCC GGA CCC GCT AGC CAG CAG TGA – 3′). β 2 -AR was then inserted upstream of IRES2-Epac1-camps and IRES2-Epac1-camps-CAAX in its vectors GLP1R-IRES2-Epac1-camps and GLP1R-IRES2-Epac1-camps-CAAX , respectively, using the following pair of primers (#19: forward: 5′ – TCA CTG CTG GCT AGC GGG TCC GGA TAA GCC CCT CTC CCT CCC CCC CCC CTA – 3′, #20: reverse: 5′ – GCT CAG GGC GAT GAT GGT CTT CAT AAG CTT GGG TCT CCC TAT AGT GAG – 3′). Lyn-Halo-SAH60-Halo-CAAX was synthesized by Genescript, Piscataway, USA. All AKAR4 constructs and Lyn-Halo-SAH60-Halo-CAAX were expressed in pcDNA3.1. Sequences were validated by sequencing of each construct by Eurofins or LGC genomics. All primer sequences are compiled in Table S2 . All constructs derived by restriction enzyme cloning or Gibson cloning were transformed and amplified in XL1-Blue competent E.coli (Agilent) or NEB® 5-alpha Competent E.coli (New England Biolabs GmbH), respectively.
For single-cell FRET imaging experiments, transfected cells were washed once and maintained in FRET buffer (10 mM HEPES, 140 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM CaCl 2 (pH=7.4)) at room temperature throughout the experiment. Experiments were conducted on an Axiovert 200 inverted microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) equipped with an oil immersion objective (plan-NEOFLUAR 63x/1.25), a 505 dcxr beam splitter (Visitron Systems, Puchheim, Germany), a xenon lamp coupled to a high speed polychromator system (Visitron Systems), an iXon Ultra EMCCD camera (Andor, Belfast, UK), and Metafluor 7 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA); or on a Leica DMi8 inverted microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) with an oil immersion objective (HC PL APO 63x/1,40-0,60 oil), a dichroic beamsplitter T505lpxr (Visitron Systems), a xenon lamp coupled to Visichrome high speed polychromator (Visitron Systems), a Photometrics Prime 95B sCMOS camera (Visitron systems) with Optosplit II dual emission image splitter (Cairn research, Faversham, UK), and Visiview 4.0 imaging software (Visitron Systems). Donor excitation occurred at 436 nm for 100 ms every 5 seconds and fluorescent images in the donor and acceptor emission channels (480 nm and 535 nm, respectively) were recorded every 5 seconds. Raw emission intensities were background-corrected by subtracting the fluorescence intensity of a cell-free region. Further, bleed-through of donor emission into the acceptor channel was subtracted as described previously ( Börner et al., 2011 12. Börner, S. ∙ Schwede, F. ∙ Schlipp, A. ... FRET measurements of intracellular cAMP concentrations and cAMP analog permeability in intact cells Nat. Protoc. 2011; 6 :427-438 Google Scholar ): For all Epac1-camps -based sensors, corrected FRET ratios were calculated as the ratio between background-corrected donor emission (I donor ) at 480 nm and background and bleed-through-corrected acceptor emission (I acceptor, corr ) at 535 nm (I donor /I acceptor, corr ). For AKAR4 -based sensors the FRET ratio was calculated as the background and bleed-through-corrected acceptor emission over background corrected donor emission (I acceptor , corr /I donor ). Drift corrected FRET traces were normalized (ΔFRET (% max)) to the basal ratio before compound addition (set to 0%) and maximum stimulus elicited by 10 μM forskolin and 100 μM IBMX at the end of each experiment (set to 100 %). Representative FRET traces in Figures 2 , 5 and 6 were smoothed using adjacent average with 2 nd order polynomial smoothing function.
Cells were washed once and maintained in FRET buffer. Confocal images were obtained on a Leica TCS SP8 laser scanning microscope with an oil immersion objective (HC PL APO 63x/1,40 oil). A 514 nm laser was used at 5 % power to excite acceptor fluorophores and the respective emission was measured within 520-600 nm. Images were acquired with a hybrid detector in photon counting mode (1024 x 1024 pixel, line average 4, 400 Hz).
After labeling cells transiently expressing the SAH60 construct with 1 μM of the HaloTag® ligand JF-646 for 20 min at 37°C, they were fixed for 30 min with ice-cold methanol at -20°C. During imaging, samples were kept in Glox buffer (0.56 mg/mL glucose oxidase, 34 μg/mL catalase, 10 % glucose, 0.1 M mercaptoethylamine, 50 mM Tris, 10 mM NaCl (pH=8.0)), at room temperature. dSTORM images were acquired on a TIRF illuminated Nikon Eclipse Ti2 microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a 100 x objective with a 1.49 NA automated correction collar; 405, 488, 561, 647 nm laser diodes coupled through an automated N-storm module, and four iXON Ultra897 EMCCD Cameras (Andor). For dSTORM imaging, the automated objective collar and the hardware auto-focus were activated. The 647 nm laser was set to a power of 100 % and images were acquired at 80 ms integration time for at least 15000 frames or until blinking events were negligible.
Epac1-camps -based cAMP FRET sensors were calibrated using a saponin permeabilization approach. First, the intracellular pH of HEK cells was assessed as described before ( Koschinski and Zaccolo, 2015 34. Koschinski, A. ∙ Zaccolo, M. A novel approach combining real-time imaging and the patch-clamp technique to calibrate FRET-based reporters for cAMP in their cellular microenvironment Methods Mol. Biol. 2015; 1294 :25-40 Google Scholar ). Resulting pH value of 7.5 was used in all subsequent steps for intracellular buffers. Subsequently, the right combination of a KCl- and K-glutamate-based intracellular buffer was assessed in CHO cells resulting in a combination of 45% KCl- + 55% K-glutamate-based buffer, used during all calibration experiments. KCL- and K-glutamate based buffers contained 135 mM KCl/135 mM K-glutamate x H 2 O, 10 mM NaCl, 6.49 mM MgCl 2 x 6H 2 O, 0.00073 mM CaCl 2 x 2H 2 O, 0.5 mM EGTA, 10 mM HEPES (pH=7.5). For calibration, HEK cells were maintained in intracellular buffer at room temperature, 10-12 μg/mL saponin was added to permeabilize the cells, together with a defined concentration of cAMP (range 0-1 mM, one concentration per cover slip).
48 h after transfection, HEK cells were washed once with FRET buffer and incubated at 37°C for 25 min with GLP-1 + 100 μM IBMX (for the concentration response curve), 10 μM Fsk+100 μM IBMX (positive control), 100 μM IBMX (negative control). After incubation, buffer was aspirated and 260 μL of 0.1 M HCl were added to lyse the cells. Cells were incubated for 20 min at room temperature and then scraped off the surface. Lysates were centrifuged at 1000 x g for 10 min and the supernatants were diluted 1:10 before proceeding with the ELISA assay. ELISA (cyclic AMP ELISA Kit, Cayman chemicals, Michigan, USA) was conducted in a 96-well microtiter format as follows: 50 μL of the diluted cell supernatants were added to each well (duplicates). To each well, 50 μL cAMP AChE tracer and 50 μL cAMP ELISA antiserum were added. The plate was sealed and incubated at 4°C for 18 h. Cells were rinsed 5 times with wash buffer and 200 μL of freshly reconstituted Ellman’s reagent was added to each well. The plate was covered with aluminum foil and let develop on an orbital shaker for 90 min at room temperature and absorbance was read at 405 nm in a Synergy Neo2 plate reader (BioTek, Vermont, USA).
HEK cells, transfected with GLP-1R biosensors were washed 48 h after the transfection, trypsinized, resuspended in 1x stimulation buffer and seeded at a density of 800 cells per well into white 96-well low-volume plates (Cisbio). Cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with a concentration range of GLP-1 diluted in 1x stimulation buffer supplemented with 200 μM IBMX (5x stimulation buffer 1 from the cAMP Gs dynamic kit HTRF (Cisbio) was diluted to 1x with ddH 2 0, supplemented with 0.2 % BSA (VWR International GmbH), and sterile filtered (pH=7.4)). cAMP accumulation was measured in a 96-well low volume microtiter plate (Cisbio) using the cAMP Gs dynamic kit HTRF (Cisbio). To do so, 5 μL cAMP-d2 dilution was added to each well, followed by 5 μL anti-cAMP-cryptate dilution. The microtiter was incubated at the room temperature for 1 h before the measurement.
CHO cells, transfected with β 2 -AR biosensors were washed 24 h after the transfection, trypsinized, resuspended in 1x stimulation buffer and seeded at a density of 4000 cells per well into white 96-well low-volume plates (Cisbio). Cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with a concentration range of isoproterenol diluted in 1x stimulation buffer supplemented with 200 μM IBMX. cAMP accumulation was measured using the cAMP Gs HiRange kit HTRF (Cisbio) as stated above. Plate reader experiments were conducted using a Synergy Neo2 plate reader (BioTek, Vermont, USA), equipped with HTRF filter optics (excitation filter 330/80 nm; dual emission filter: 662/10 nm - 665/8 nm). Concentration−effect curves were fitted by a three-parameter logistic function yielding parameter values for a ligand’s potency (pEC 50 ).
HEK cells, expressing AKAR4 biosensors were washed 24 h after the transfection, trypsinized, resuspended and transferred to Poly-D-Lysine-precoated black-wall, black-bottomed 96-well plates (Brand) at a density of 60,000 cells/well. On the next day, cells were washed and medium was replaced with 90 μL FRET buffer. Basal FRET ratio was read for 5 min and subsequently, 10 μL of 10x forskolin dilutions or FRET buffer (negative control) was applied to each well and the FRET ratio was recorded for 20 min. Plate reader experiments were conducted at 37 °C using a Synergy Neo2 plate reader (BioTek, Vermont, USA), equipped with filter optics (excitation filter 420/50 nm; dual emission filter: 485/20 nm - 540/25 nm). FRET ratios were defined as corrected acceptor emission/donor emission. FRET ratios before ligand/buffer addition were averaged and defined as FRET basal . To quantify ligand-induced FRET changes, ΔFRET was calculated for each well and time point as percent over basal ([(FRET stim − FRET basal )/FRET basal ] × 100). Subsequently, the average ΔFRET of buffer-treated control wells was subtracted ( Schihada et al., 2021 53. Schihada, H. ∙ Nemec, K. ∙ Lohse, M.J. ... Bioluminescence in G protein-coupled receptors drug screening using nanoluciferase and halo-tag technology Methods Mol. Biol. 2021; 2268 :137-147 Google Scholar ). Concentration−effect curves were fitted by a three-parameter logistic function yielding parameter values for a ligand’s potency (pEC 50 ).
In our quantitative considerations ( Methods S1 ) we assume a cytosolic PDE concentration of 3 nM and a cAMP diffusion coefficient of D = 100 μm 2 /s ( Bock et al., 2020 11. Bock, A. ∙ Annibale, P. ∙ Konrad, C. ... Optical mapping of cAMP signaling at the nanometer scale Cell. 2020; 182 :1519-1530.e17 Google Scholar ). Based on this, a constant that describes the decrease of [ΔcAMP] with increasing distance from the source in stationary profiles by cytosolic PDEs is given by 0.17 μm −1 ( Methods S1 ). Thus, we can neglect cAMP degradation by cytosolic PDEs on the lengthscale of 60 nm.
To quantify how cAMP concentrations at GPCRs decrease over a nanometer range, the [cAMP] values ( Figure 7 B) at GLP-1R and the cytosol were fit to the corresponding solution of the diffusion equation ( Methods S1 ) [ c ⁢ A ⁢ M ⁢ P ] = 2 ⁢ A / r + B , (Equation 1) where r denotes the cAMP distance from the receptor, A denotes the cAMP concentration increase above bulk at 2 nm distance from the receptor, and B signifies the cAMP concentration in the cytosol that was constrained to the cytosolic [cAMP] (150 nM).
Confocal images were analyzed using ImageJ. Each image was corrected by subtracting the average background fluorescence. Contrast was enhanced while keeping the saturated pixels at 0.1%. dSTORM movies were processed and analyzed in ImageJ using the Thunderstorm plugin ( Ovesny et al., 2014 46. Ovesný, M. ∙ Křížek, P. ∙ Borkovec, J. ... ThunderSTORM: a comprehensive ImageJ plug-in for PALM and STORM data analysis and super-resolution imaging Bioinformatics. 2014; 30 :2389-2390 Google Scholar ; Schneider et al., 2012 54. Schneider, C.A. ∙ Rasband, W.S. ∙ Eliceiri, K.W. NIH Image to ImageJ: 25 years of image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :671-675 Google Scholar ).
Statistical analyses and curve fitting were performed with Prism 7.0 (or newer) software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, USA) and OriginPro (OriginLab Corporation, Northampton, USA). Normalized FRET ratios are expressed as the mean ± SEM (ΔFRET (%max)). In single cell experiments, all cells were analyzed individually and plotted as symbols in all bar graphs. For normalization of FRET ratios (and plotting of these values in bar graphs), we used the plateaus of the trace that were reached after ligand additions. We refer to the number of individual cells analyzed as n-number, and this n-number was used for statistical analysis. All data were tested for Gaussian distribution using the D’Agostino-Pearson normality test. Differences between means were assessed by a two-tailed Student’s t-test (for two groups) or a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA, for three or more groups) followed by Tukey’s post hoc test for normally distributed data and a Kruskal-Wallis test in the case of non-normally distributed data. Differences were considered significant for values of p<0.05. P values >0.05 are indicated in the figures as not significantly different (ns). All experiments and representative data shown were repeated at least three times and performed with independent samples. Statistical details of all experiments can be found in the figures and figure legends.
