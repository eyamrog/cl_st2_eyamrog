Title: CCT2 is an aggrephagy receptor for clearance of solid protein aggregates


Abstract: Summary

Protein aggregation is a hallmark of multiple human pathologies. Autophagy selectively degrades protein aggregates via aggrephagy. How selectivity is achieved has been elusive. Here, we identify the chaperonin subunit CCT2 as an autophagy receptor regulating the clearance of aggregation-prone proteins in the cell and the mouse brain. CCT2 associates with aggregation-prone proteins independent of cargo ubiquitination and interacts with autophagosome marker ATG8s through a non-classical VLIR motif. In addition, CCT2 regulates aggrephagy independently of the ubiquitin-binding receptors (P62, NBR1, and TAX1BP1) or chaperone-mediated autophagy. Unlike P62, NBR1, and TAX1BP1, which facilitate the clearance of protein condensates with liquidity, CCT2 specifically promotes the autophagic degradation of protein aggregates with little liquidity (solid aggregates). Furthermore, aggregation-prone protein accumulation induces the functional switch of CCT2 from a chaperone subunit to an autophagy receptor by promoting CCT2 monomer formation, which exposes the VLIR to ATG8s interaction and, therefore, enables the autophagic function.

Section: Introduction

Accumulation of protein aggregates is a hallmark of multiple human pathologies, including neurodegeneration, eye disease, and type II diabetes ( Mathieu et al., 2020 62. Mathieu, C. ∙ Pappu, R.V. ∙ Taylor, J.P. Beyond aggregation: pathological phase transitions in neurodegenerative disease Science. 2020; 370 :56-60 Google Scholar ; Valastyan and Lindquist, 2014 101.

Vaquer-Alicea, J. ∙ Diamond, M.I. Propagation of protein aggregation in neurodegenerative diseases Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2019; 88 :785-810 Google Scholar ). Sufficient amounts of evidence demonstrate autophagy, a lysosome-mediated bulk degradation pathway, as a key cellular process to clear protein aggregates ( Lamark and Johansen, 2012 51. Lamark, T. ∙ Johansen, T. Aggrephagy: selective disposal of protein aggregates by macroautophagy Int. J. Cell Biol. 2012; 2012 :736905 Google Scholar ). How the autophagic membrane recognizes protein aggregates and selectively targets them for degradation has been a major question in the field. Multiple studies show that ubiquitin-binding receptors (P62(SQSTM1), NBR1, TAX1BP1, Optineurin, and Tollip) ( Kirkin et al., 2009 44. Kirkin, V. ∙ Lamark, T. ∙ Sou, Y.S. ...

Loss of TAX1BP1-directed autophagy results in protein aggregate accumulation in the brain Mol. Cell. 2020; 80 :779-795.e10 Google Scholar ), the cytosolic proteins containing both a ubiquitin-binding domain and an LC3-interacting region (LIR, allowing for the binding of autophagy-related protein 8s (ATG8s) on the autophagic membrane), are responsible for recruitment of the autophagic membrane to protein aggregates and, therefore, mediate the autophagic clearance ( Gatica et al., 2018 19. Gatica, D. ∙ Lahiri, V. ∙ Klionsky, D.J. Cargo recognition and degradation by selective autophagy Nat. Cell Biol. 2018; 20 :233-242 Google Scholar ; Johansen and Lamark, 2020 37.

Khaminets, A. ∙ Behl, C. ∙ Dikic, I. Ubiquitin-dependent and independent signals in selective autophagy Trends Cell Biol. 2016; 26 :6-16 Google Scholar ). Because the nature of these ubiquitin-binding receptors is to recognize ubiquitin chains, they are usually not specific for aggrephagy and mostly shared by other types of selective autophagy, e.g., mitophagy, xenophagy, and lysophagy ( Gatica et al., 2018 19.

Khaminets, A. ∙ Behl, C. ∙ Dikic, I. Ubiquitin-dependent and independent signals in selective autophagy Trends Cell Biol. 2016; 26 :6-16 Google Scholar ).
Recent studies have identified another category of autophagy receptors (e.g., FUNDC1, NIX, and BNIP3) in mitophagy ( Hanna et al., 2012 27. Hanna, R.A. ∙ Quinsay, M.N. ∙ Orogo, A.M. ...

Receptor-mediated selective autophagy degrades the endoplasmic reticulum and the nucleus Nature. 2015; 522 :359-362 Google Scholar ). Unlike the ubiquitin-binding receptors mentioned above, these receptors do not harbor a ubiquitin-binding domain but are LIR-containing organelle-resident proteins that are specific organelle markers unique for each type of selective autophagy ( Chino and Mizushima, 2020 12. Chino, H. ∙ Mizushima, N. ER-phagy: quality control and turnover of endoplasmic reticulum Trends Cell Biol. 2020; 30 :384-398 Google Scholar ; Liu et al., 2014 58. Liu, L. ∙ Sakakibara, K. ∙ Chen, Q. ... Receptor-mediated mitophagy in yeast and mammalian systems Cell Res. 2014; 24 :787-795 Google Scholar ). Although specific aggrephagy receptors have been reported in yeast S. cerevisiae (Atg19, cytoplasm-to-vacuole targeting [Cvt] pathway) and C. elegans (SEPA-1 and EPG-7) ( Lin et al., 2013 56.

SEPA-1 mediates the specific recognition and degradation of P granule components by autophagy in C. elegans Cell. 2009; 136 :308-321 Google Scholar ), it has been unclear whether specific aggrephagy receptors exist in mammals and, if they exist, how they regulate aggrephagy.
Emerging evidence indicates phase separation as an important phenomenon involved in multiple cellular processes and human diseases ( Alberti and Dormann, 2019 2. Alberti, S. ∙ Dormann, D. Liquid-liquid phase separation in disease Annu. Rev. Genet. 2019; 53 :171-194 Google Scholar ; Banani et al., 2017 5. Banani, S.F. ∙ Lee, H.O. ∙ Hyman, A.A. ...

Liquid phase condensation in cell physiology and disease Science. 2017; 357 :eaaf4382 Google Scholar ). It has been shown that aggregation-prone proteins form phase-separated biomolecular condensates/droplets before transitioning into pathogenic solid protein aggregates ( Babinchak and Surewicz, 2020 4.

Wegmann, S. ∙ Eftekharzadeh, B. ∙ Tepper, K. ... Tau protein liquid-liquid phase separation can initiate tau aggregation EMBO J. 2018; 37 :e98049 Google Scholar ). Autophagy has been proposed to preferentially clear protein condensates with a certain amount of liquidity using the known aggrephagy receptors Atg19 ( S. cerevisiae ) or SEPA-1 ( C. elegans ) ( Yamasaki et al., 2020 116.

Zhang, G. ∙ Wang, Z. ∙ Du, Z. ... mTOR regulates phase separation of PGL granules to modulate their autophagic degradation Cell. 2018; 174 :1492-1506.e22 e1422 Google Scholar ). In addition, the ubiquitin-binding receptors, P62 and NBR1, organize the formation of phase-separated condensates, which likely facilitates autophagic clearance of the protein condensates ( Agudo-Canalejo et al., 2021 1.

Zaffagnini, G. ∙ Savova, A. ∙ Danieli, A. ... p62 filaments capture and present ubiquitinated cargos for autophagy EMBO J. 2018; 37 :e98308 Google Scholar ). However, it remains to be clarified how solid protein aggregates are recognized and selectively cleared by aggrephagy.
Cellular proteostasis is tightly controlled by a network of molecular chaperones that maintain protein folding and cooperate with the degradation machinery ( Hipp et al., 2019 29. Hipp, M.S. ∙ Kasturi, P. ∙ Hartl, F.U. The proteostasis network and its decline in ageing Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2019; 20 :421-435 Google Scholar ; Kim et al., 2013 42. Kim, Y.E. ∙ Hipp, M.S. ∙ Bracher, A. ... Molecular chaperone functions in protein folding and proteostasis Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2013; 82 :323-355 Google Scholar ). Chaperones counteract aberrant folding and aggregation via direct binding to the misfolded protein ( Hipp et al., 2019 29. Hipp, M.S. ∙ Kasturi, P. ∙ Hartl, F.U. The proteostasis network and its decline in ageing Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2019; 20 :421-435 Google Scholar ; Kim et al., 2013 42. Kim, Y.E. ∙ Hipp, M.S. ∙ Bracher, A. ... Molecular chaperone functions in protein folding and proteostasis Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2013; 82 :323-355 Google Scholar ). Chaperonins are among the earliest types of chaperones identified ( Horwich and Fenton, 2020 32. Horwich, A.L. ∙ Fenton, W.A. Chaperonin-assisted protein folding: a chronologue Q. Rev. Biophys. 2020; 53 :e4 Google Scholar ). The eukaryotic chaperonin TCP-1 ring complex (TRiC) accounts for the folding of ∼10% of cytosolic protein substrates, including cytoskeletal proteins, cell cycle regulators, and aggregation-prone proteins ( Gestaut et al., 2019 21. Gestaut, D. ∙ Limatola, A. ∙ Joachimiak, L. ... The ATP-powered gymnastics of TRiC/CCT: an asymmetric protein folding machine with a symmetric origin story Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2019; 55 :50-58 Google Scholar ; Jin et al., 2019 36. Jin, M. ∙ Liu, C. ∙ Han, W. ... TRiC/CCT chaperonin: structure and function Subcell. Biochem. 2019; 93 :625-654 Google Scholar ). The TRiC consists of eight subunits (CCT1-8) arranged in two octameric rings stacked back to back. Each subunit consists of an equatorial domain and an apical domain that are responsible for ATP and substrate binding, respectively. Protein folding is achieved through a coordinated ATP-driven conformational cycle ( Gestaut et al., 2019 21. Gestaut, D. ∙ Limatola, A. ∙ Joachimiak, L. ... The ATP-powered gymnastics of TRiC/CCT: an asymmetric protein folding machine with a symmetric origin story Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2019; 55 :50-58 Google Scholar ; Jin et al., 2019 36. Jin, M. ∙ Liu, C. ∙ Han, W. ... TRiC/CCT chaperonin: structure and function Subcell. Biochem. 2019; 93 :625-654 Google Scholar ). Subunits of chaperonin TRiC were found to be components of protein aggregates or associating with aggregation-prone proteins ( David et al., 2010 13. David, D.C. ∙ Ollikainen, N. ∙ Trinidad, J.C. ... Widespread protein aggregation as an inherent part of aging in C. elegans PLoS Biol. 2010; 8 :e1000450 Google Scholar ; Kim et al., 2016 43. Kim, Y.E. ∙ Hosp, F. ∙ Frottin, F. ... Soluble oligomers of PolyQ-expanded huntingtin target a multiplicity of key cellular factors Mol. Cell. 2016; 63 :951-964 Google Scholar ). Although multiple studies have shown that the TRiC and its subunits prevent protein aggregate formation ( Behrends et al., 2006 6. Behrends, C. ∙ Langer, C.A. ∙ Boteva, R. ... Chaperonin TRiC promotes the assembly of polyQ expansion proteins into nontoxic oligomers Mol. Cell. 2006; 23 :887-897 Google Scholar ; Kitamura et al., 2006 45.

Somatic increase of CCT8 mimics proteostasis of human pluripotent stem cells and extends C. elegans lifespan Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 :13649 Google Scholar ; Tam et al., 2006 97. Tam, S. ∙ Geller, R. ∙ Spiess, C. ... The chaperonin TRiC controls polyglutamine aggregation and toxicity through subunit-specific interactions Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8 :1155-1162 Google Scholar ), it has been unclear whether these aggregate-associated TRiC subunits have extra functions in maintaining proteostasis.
In the current work, we identify a function of the TRiC subunit chaperonin-containing TCP-1 subunit 2 (CCT2) in aggrephagy, which is conserved in mammals and yeast. CCT2 promotes autophagosome incorporation and clearance of protein aggregates with little liquidity via interacting with ATG8s and aggregation-prone proteins independent of cargo ubiquitination. In addition, CCT2 acts independently of the known lysosome-mediated pathways for clearance of aggregation-prone proteins; e.g., ubiquitin-binding receptors (P62, NBR1, and TAX1BP1)-mediated aggrephagy and chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA). CCT2 switches its function from a chaperone to an autophagy receptor via monomer formation, which exposes its ATG8-interaction motif and, therefore, allows for the recruitment of autophagosomal membranes. The dual function of CCT2, as a chaperone and an aggrephagy receptor, enables double-layer maintenance of proteostasis.

Section: Results

Selective targeting of the autophagic membrane to protein aggregates is an essential step in aggrephagy ( Gatica et al., 2018 19. Gatica, D. ∙ Lahiri, V. ∙ Klionsky, D.J. Cargo recognition and degradation by selective autophagy Nat. Cell Biol. 2018; 20 :233-242 Google Scholar ). To dissect this process, we developed an in vitro reconstitution system to recapitulate autophagic membrane targeting to protein aggregates ( Figure 1 A). It has been shown that autophagy receptors recruit autophagic membranes via associating with the ATG8 family members on the autophagosome ( Johansen and Lamark, 2020 37. Johansen, T. ∙ Lamark, T. Selective autophagy: ATG8 family proteins, LIR motifs and cargo receptors J. Mol. Biol. 2020; 432 :80-103 Google Scholar ). In this system, we determined the recruitment of a fluorescence-labeled ATG8 family member LC3 to the PolyQ-huntingtin (HTT) inclusion bodies (IBs), which contain multiple properties of protein aggregates and have been extensively investigated for aggrephagy ( Figure 1 A). Similar to the autophagy receptor P62 ( Bjørkøy et al., 2005 8. Bjørkøy, G. ∙ Lamark, T. ∙ Brech, A. ... p62/SQSTM1 forms protein aggregates degraded by autophagy and has a protective effect on huntingtin-induced cell death J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171 :603-614 Google Scholar ), the fluorescent LC3 was attached to the IBs ( Figure 1 B). In addition, IB association of the fluorescent LC3 was competed by unlabeled LC3 instead of BSA or FBS, indicating binding site specificity of LC3 on the IB ( Figures 1 C and 1D). To quantitatively analyze the recruitment of LC3 to the IB, we employed a pulse shape analysis (PulSA) based on flow cytometry ( Ramdzan et al., 2013 80. Ramdzan, Y.M. ∙ Wood, R. ∙ Hatters, D.M. Pulse shape analysis (PulSA) to track protein translocalization in cells by flow cytometry: applications for polyglutamine aggregation Methods Mol. Biol. 2013; 1017 :85-93 Google Scholar ) ( Figures S1 A and S1B). Consistently, the fluorescent LC3 was recruited to the IB, which was specifically inhibited by the unlabeled LC3 ( Figures S1 C and S1D). Therefore, certain components on the IB specifically associate with LC3.
Interestingly, we observed different LC3 recruitment among IBs, indicating variable amounts of LC3-attracting components among individual IBs ( Figure 1 C, compare arrow with arrowhead-pointed IBs). The observation inspired us to incorporate and develop a fluorescence-activated particle sorting (FAPS) system based on flow cytometry to isolate IBs with high (H) and low (L) LC3 association from two different cell lines, a differentiated mouse neuroblastoma cell line N2A with the Q150-HTT-GFP and a human osteosarcoma cell line U2OS with Q91-HTT-mCherry ( Figures 1 E–1G, S1 E, and S1F; Bersuker et al., 2016 7.

Neurosci. 2002; 22 :9267-9277 Google Scholar ). In the immunoblot assay, the H-LC3 IBs contained a higher amount of LC3 as well as P62 and NBR1, confirming the feasibility of the FAPS system ( Figures 1 H and S1 G). Subsequently, we employed an unlabeled quantitative mass spectrometry approach to compare protein components enriched in H- and L-LC3 IBs ( Figures 1 I, 1J, S1 H, and S1I; Tables S1 and S2 ). Consistent with the above immunoblot assay, P62 and NBR1 were enriched in the H-LC3 IBs ( Figures 1 J and S1 I; Bjørkøy et al., 2005 8. Bjørkøy, G. ∙ Lamark, T. ∙ Brech, A. ... p62/SQSTM1 forms protein aggregates degraded by autophagy and has a protective effect on huntingtin-induced cell death J.

Loss of TAX1BP1-directed autophagy results in protein aggregate accumulation in the brain Mol. Cell. 2020; 80 :779-795.e10 Google Scholar ). In addition, TAX1BP1 ( Sarraf et al., 2020 84. Sarraf, S.A. ∙ Shah, H.V. ∙ Kanfer, G. ... Loss of TAX1BP1-directed autophagy results in protein aggregate accumulation in the brain Mol. Cell. 2020; 80 :779-795.e10 Google Scholar ), a recently identified ubiquitin-binding aggrephagy receptor, also appeared in the H-LC3 IBs ( Figure 1 J). Two other reported ubiquitin-binding aggrephagy receptors, Optineurin and Tollip ( Korac et al., 2013 48. Korac, J. ∙ Schaeffer, V. ∙ Kovacevic, I. ... Ubiquitin-independent function of optineurin in autophagic clearance of protein aggregates J. Cell Sci. 2013; 126 :580-592 Google Scholar ; Lu et al., 2014 61. Lu, K. ∙ Psakhye, I. ∙ Jentsch, S. Autophagic clearance of polyQ proteins mediated by ubiquitin-Atg8 adaptors of the conserved CUET protein family Cell. 2014; 158 :549-563 Google Scholar ), were detected without enrichment to the H-LC3 IBs, likely because our in vitro assay could not recapitulate the function of the two receptors ( Table S1 ).
Interestingly, we found multiple chaperones and co-chaperones enriched in the H-LC3 IBs. These chaperones and co-chaperones were highly overlapped between the H-LC3 IBs of N2A and U2OS ( Figure 1 K, 11 overlap of 19 in N2A and 13 in U2OS, respectively). We determined the effects of the chaperones or co-chaperones on autophagosome association with polyQ-HTT IBs and found that nine out of the 21 analyzed chaperones or co-chaperones significantly increased the association of LC3 puncta (an indicator of autophagic membrane) with the IBs ( Figures 1 L, S1 J, and S1K). Of the nine chaperones, six dramatically promoted lysosome-dependent polyQ-HTT degradation in a chase assay with cycloheximide (CHX) inhibition of protein synthesis employed before to determine autophagy turnover ( Figures 1 L and S1 L–S1T; Wong et al., 2015 112. Wong, P.M. ∙ Feng, Y. ∙ Wang, J. ... Regulation of autophagy by coordinated action of mTORC1 and protein phosphatase 2A Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 :8048 Google Scholar ). Of the six chaperones, four are chaperonin subunits (CCT1, CCT2, CCT3, and CCT6), and the other two contain HSP90AB1, a cytosolic chaperone, and HSPA9, a multi-location chaperone primarily in the mitochondria ( Figure 1 L, arrowhead pointed).
We next focused on CCT2 because: (1) CCT2 was the most enriched chaperone in the mass spectrometry and had the strongest effect on promoting autophagosome association with the IB and lysosome-dependent HTT clearance ( Figures 1 J and 1L); (2) in the PulSA assay mentioned above ( Figures S1 A and S1B), knockdown (KD) of CCT2 decreased LC3 association with IBs and vice versa with the expression of exogenous CCT2, suggesting a major contribution of CCT2 to LC3 recruitment to IBs in the in vitro assay ( Figures 1 M and 1N); (3) in our preliminary data, IBs from glucose starvation-treated cells showed increased LC3 recruitment and mass spectrometry also indicated the enrichment of CCT2 in the IBs from glucose starvation-treated cells (data not shown); and (4) in a label-free mass spectrometry quantification, CCT2 (6-fold lower than P62 but 10-fold and 25-fold higher than NBR1 and TAX1BP1, respectively) appeared to be the highest compared with the other four chaperones (CCT1,CCT3, CCT6, and HSPA9) that associate with ATG8s ( Figure 1 O). Although the amount of HSP90AB1 was higher than CCT2, it did not associate with ATG8s and was not further studied ( Figure S5 D).
Around 10% of endogenous CCT2 (versus ∼70% of P62) localized on the IBs in N2A cells ( Figure 1 P). Similar to P62 ( Figure 1 B), the exogenously expressed CCT2 associated with IBs ( Figure 2 A). In addition, expression of CCT2 increased LC3 puncta with IBs (∼2.5-fold increase, Figures 2 A and 2B). Similarly, the endogenous CCT2 also associated with IBs, and the amount of CCT2 around the IBs correlated with the amount of LC3 puncta association ( Figures S2 A and S2B). The IB-associated LC3 puncta requires LC3 lipidation, as lipidation-deficient LC3 mutant (G120A) failed to form puncta associated with IBs in the presence and absence of digitonin permeabilization to remove cytosolic components ( Figures 2 C and 2D). We also observed colocalization of both wild type (WT) and G120A mutant LC3 (diffused signal but not clear puncta) with the IB when co-expressed with Q103-HTT ( Figure 2 C), which reflects the previous results showing that the unlipidated LC3 co-aggregates with protein aggregates ( Kuma et al., 2007 50.

Consideration about negative controls for LC3 and expression vectors for four colored fluorescent protein-LC3 negative controls Autophagy. 2008; 4 :131-134 Google Scholar ). Consistent with the requirement of LC3 lipidation, the CCT2-promoted LC3 puncta around the IB were not observed in Atg5 knockout cells ( Figures 2 E and 2F).
In electron microscopy (EM), expression of CCT2 increased the recruitment of autophagic vacuoles to the IBs compared with the control (∼2-fold increase, Figures S2 C and S2D). The presence of autophagic membrane-like vacuoles on IBs was also confirmed by correlative light electron microscopy (CLEM) ( Figure S2 E). The data indicate that CCT2 promotes autophagic membrane targeting to protein aggregates. The IB-associated LC3 puncta increased by CCT2 colocalized with FIP200/RB1CC1 and LAMP2, confirming that these puncta are autophagosomes, which can fuse with the lysosome ( Figures S2 F and S2G). In addition, CCT2 expression increased lysosome (labeled by LAMP2) association with the IB ( Figures S2 G and S2H).
To test whether CCT2 promotes autophagic engulfment of Q103-HTT, we performed Apex2 labeling of Q103-HTT. In the EM analysis, we observed a greater number of Apex2-positive signals in the autophagic vacuoles in the cells with CCT2 expression than that in the control ( Figures 2 H and 2I, ∼2.5-fold increase). The autophagosome encapsulation was abolished in Atg5 KD cells or cells treated with SAR405 ( Figures 2 H and 2I), a class III phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase inhibitor that blocks autophagy in the early stage ( Ronan et al., 2014 83. Ronan, B. ∙ Flamand, O. ∙ Vescovi, L. ... A highly potent and selective Vps34 inhibitor alters vesicle trafficking and autophagy Nat. Chem. Biol. 2014; 10 :1013-1019 Google Scholar ). In a membrane fraction approach, CCT2 increased the amount of Q103-HTT in the autophagosome fraction (F-AG) ( Figures 2 J–2L, 2.5-fold and 3.9-fold before and after proteinase K digestion, respectively). Both Q103-HTT and CCT2 were protected from proteinase K digestion, indicating that they are inside the autophagosome ( Figure 2 L). These data together demonstrate that CCT2 promotes Q103-HTT entry into the autophagosome.
In the chase analysis as described above ( Figures S1 L–S1T), expression of CCT2 enhanced Q103-HTT degradation, which was blocked by the lysosome inhibitor bafilomycin A1 in U2OS, N2A, and the primary cultured striatal neuron ( Figures S2 I–S2N). In a Huntington’s disease mice with polyQ (Q140) knockin ( Menalled et al., 2003 63. Menalled, L.B. ∙ Sison, J.D. ∙ Dragatsis, I. ... Time course of early motor and neuropathological anomalies in a knock-in mouse model of Huntington's disease with 140 CAG repeats J. Comp. Neurol. 2003; 465 :11-26 Google Scholar ), expression of CCT2 reduced the level of endogenous polyQ-HTT (HTT-Q140) in the striatum ( Figure 2 M). Knockdown of Atg5 and Beclin-1, two major autophagy regulators ( Liang et al., 1999 55. Liang, X.H. ∙ Jackson, S. ∙ Seaman, M. ... Induction of autophagy and inhibition of tumorigenesis by beclin 1 Nature. 1999; 402 :672-676 Google Scholar ; Mizushima et al., 1998 68. Mizushima, N. ∙ Sugita, H. ∙ Yoshimori, T. ... A new protein conjugation system in human. The counterpart of the yeast Apg12p conjugation system essential for autophagy J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273 :33889-33892 Google Scholar ), abolished the effect of CCT2 on Q103-HTT degradation, confirming the notion that CCT2 regulates the clearance of Q103-HTT via autophagy ( Figures 2 N and 2O).
It has been shown that CHX inhibits starvation-induced autophagy via activation of mTORC1. Inhibition of mTORC1 counteracts the inhibitory effect ( Watanabe-Asano et al., 2014 108. Watanabe-Asano, T. ∙ Kuma, A. ∙ Mizushima, N. Cycloheximide inhibits starvation-induced autophagy through mTORC1 activation Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2014; 445 :334-339 Google Scholar ). In all the CHX chase experiments, the degradation of protein aggregates relied on basal autophagy. Moreover, in the presence of Torin-1, an mTORC1 inhibitor ( Thoreen et al., 2009 99. Thoreen, C.C. ∙ Kang, S.A. ∙ Chang, J.W. ... An ATP-competitive mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor reveals rapamycin-resistant functions of mTORC1 J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284 :8023-8032 Google Scholar ), CCT2 was still able to promote Q103-HTT degradation ( Figures S2 O and S2P), indicating that the effect of CHX on mTORC1 activity does not interfere with CCT2-promoted Q103-HTT clearance via autophagy. To further support the conclusion reached by CHX chase experiments, we employed a puromycin chase assay. Again, CCT2 still increased lysosome-dependent Q103-HTT turnover ( Figures S2 Q and S2R). Imaging assays based on analyzing IBs also confirmed the enhancing effect of CCT2 on protein aggregate clearance ( Figures S5 J and S5K).
To determine whether CCT2 regulates the clearance of other aggregation-prone proteins, we analyzed LC3 colocalization and turnover of Tau (P301L) and SOD1 (G93A) ( Goedert et al., 2017 22. Goedert, M. ∙ Eisenberg, D.S. ∙ Crowther, R.A. Propagation of tau aggregates and neurodegeneration Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2017; 40 :189-210 Google Scholar ; Watanabe et al., 2001 107. Watanabe, M. ∙ Dykes-Hoberg, M. ∙ Culotta, V.C. ... Histological evidence of protein aggregation in mutant SOD1 transgenic mice and in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis neural tissues Neurobiol. Dis. 2001; 8 :933-941 Google Scholar ). Under steady states, Tau (P301L) is primarily cytosolic (data not shown) and previous work showed the requirement of extracellular seeding for massive Tau (P301L) aggregation ( Guo and Lee, 2011 26. Guo, J.L. ∙ Lee, V.M. Seeding of normal Tau by pathological Tau conformers drives pathogenesis of Alzheimer-like tangles J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286 :15317-15331 Google Scholar ; Waxman and Giasson, 2011 109. Waxman, E.A. ∙ Giasson, B.I. Induction of intracellular tau aggregation is promoted by α-synuclein seeds and provides novel insights into the hyperphosphorylation of tau J. Neurosci. 2011; 31 :7604-7618 Google Scholar ). Upon digitonin treatment to remove the soluble form, small Tau (P301L) aggregates could be detected ( Figure S3 A). The de novo formed Tau (P301L) aggregates could be caused by endogenous triggers; e.g., GSK3β or Fyn kinase which has been shown to promote Tau aggregation ( Briner et al., 2020 10. Briner, A. ∙ Götz, J. ∙ Polanco, J.C. Fyn kinase controls tau aggregation in vivo Cell Rep. 2020; 32 :108045 Google Scholar ; Rankin et al., 2007 81. Rankin, C.A. ∙ Sun, Q. ∙ Gamblin, T.C. Tau phosphorylation by GSK-3beta promotes tangle-like filament morphology Mol. Neurodegener. 2007; 2 :12 Google Scholar ; Sato et al., 2002 85. Sato, S. ∙ Tatebayashi, Y. ∙ Akagi, T. ... Aberrant tau phosphorylation by glycogen synthase kinase-3beta and JNK3 induces oligomeric tau fibrils in COS-7 cells J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277 :42060-42065 Google Scholar ). CCT2 colocalized with Tau (P301L) aggregates and promoted LC3 recruitment to the aggregates. We observed multiple puncta triple positive for Tau (P301L), CCT2, and LC3 ( Figure S3 A, arrows). In addition, the area of triple-positive puncta almost equaled the increase of LC3-Tau (P301L) colocalization caused by CCT2 expression ( Figures S3 A and S3B). The data indicate that CCT2 directly promotes autophagosome incorporation of Tau (P301L). Consistently, CCT2 expression enhanced lysosome-dependent clearance of Tau (P301L) and SOD1 (G93A) ( Figures S3 C–S3F).
To determine the specific effect of autophagy on aggregate clearance, we removed soluble Q103-HTT with digitonin. CCT2 knockdown largely compromised insoluble Q103-HTT degradation, which was restored by CCT2 re-expression ( Figures S3 G and S3H). Notably, the turnover of CCT2 was also inhibited by bafilomycin A1, or autophagy gene knockdown ( Figure 2 N). In addition, CCT2 cofractionated with LC3-II ( Figures 2 K and S3 K) and colocalized with the autophagosome ( Figure S3 A), and bafilomycin A1 treatment increased the amount of cellular and autophagosome-localized CCT2 ( Figures S3 I and S3J). Therefore, the data, together with those showing the incorporation of CCT2 into the autophagosome ( Figure 2 L), indicate that CCT2 is a substrate of autophagy, a characteristic shared by autophagy receptors. In support of the notion, proteomic studies by other groups also detected CCT2 as a component of the autophagosome ( Dengjel et al., 2012 14. Dengjel, J. ∙ Høyer-Hansen, M. ∙ Nielsen, M.O. ... Identification of autophagosome-associated proteins and regulators by quantitative proteomic analysis and genetic screens Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2012; 11 :M111 014035 Google Scholar ; Zellner et al., 2021 121. Zellner, S. ∙ Schifferer, M. ∙ Behrends, C. Systematically defining selective autophagy receptor-specific cargo using autophagosome content profiling Mol. Cell. 2021; 81 :1337-1354.e8 Google Scholar ; Zhang et al., 2016 125. Zhang, T. ∙ Shen, S. ∙ Qu, J. ... Global analysis of cellular protein flux quantifies the selectivity of basal autophagy Cell Rep. 2016; 14 :2426-2439 Google Scholar ).
The TRiC chaperone activity was recently shown to regulate autophagy in a neuronal cell line via F-actin and lysosome biogenesis ( Pavel et al., 2016 77. Pavel, M. ∙ Imarisio, S. ∙ Menzies, F.M. ... CCT complex restricts neuropathogenic protein aggregation via autophagy Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 :13821 Google Scholar ). Knockdown of CCT2 or two other components of TRiC, CCT4 or CCT5, did not obviously affect starvation-induced autophagy in the cell lines used in our study, as revealed by LC3 lipidation and the tandem fluorescence LC3 assay, nor did the expression of CCT2 ( Figures S4 A–S4F), suggesting that, in our experiments, the effect of CCT2 on Q103-HTT degradation may not attribute to autophagy regulation as a whole. In a mt-Keima assay, KD of CCT2 did not affect basal or mitochondria damage-induced mitophagy ( Figures S4 G and S4H). Therefore, CCT2 may be specific for aggrephagy versus other types of selective autophagy.
In co-immunoprecipitation (coIP), CCT2 interacted with the six ATG8 family members with a preference for LC3C, in which the C-terminal one-third of CCT2 (D3), corresponding to part of the equatorial domain, accounts for the association ( Figures 3 A and 3B). An involvement of LC3C in aggrephagy was also reported by another study ( Wetzel et al., 2020 111. Wetzel, L. ∙ Blanchard, S. ∙ Rama, S. ... TECPR1 promotes aggrephagy by direct recruitment of LC3C autophagosomes to lysosomes Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :2993 Google Scholar ).
Three other TRiC subunits (CCT1, CCT3, and CCT6) and HSPA9, but not HSP90AB1, which promoted autophagosome association with IBs and lysosome-dependent polyQ-HTT turnover, also associated with ATG8s with a preference for LC3C ( Figures S5 A–S5E). HSPA9 is primarily a mitochondrial chaperone with multiple cellular localizations ( Szabadkai et al., 2006 96. Szabadkai, G. ∙ Bianchi, K. ∙ Várnai, P. ... Chaperone-mediated coupling of endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial Ca2+ channels J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175 :901-911 Google Scholar ; Wadhwa et al., 2002 106. Wadhwa, R. ∙ Taira, K. ∙ Kaul, S.C. An Hsp70 family chaperone, mortalin/mthsp70/PBP74/Grp75: what, when, and where? Cell Stress Chaperones. 2002; 7 :309-316 Google Scholar ). Its long-form, likely the cytosolic form containing the transit peptide, associated with LC3C and IBs ( Figure S5 E). CCT5 and CCT8, which had little effect on polyQ-HTT degradation, did not associate with LC3C ( Figure S5 G). The data suggest a correlation of ATG8 association with the involvement of aggrephagy among the chaperones tested.
Further mapping of the LC3C interaction region of CCT2-D3 using synthetic peptide pull-down found that a peptide (P7) covering aa 490–519 directly interacted with the purified LC3C ( Figure 3 C). Interestingly, we did not find a canonical LIR motif within P7. Instead, we noticed that two triple consecutive hydrophobic residues (VLL and VIL) resemble the NDP52 CLIR-motif, which is composed of LVV and accounts for LC3C interaction ( von Muhlinen et al., 2012 105. von Muhlinen, N. ∙ Akutsu, M. ∙ Ravenhill, B.J. ... LC3C, bound selectively by a noncanonical LIR motif in NDP52, is required for antibacterial autophagy Mol. Cell. 2012; 48 :329-342 Google Scholar ). Mutation of VLL and VIL abolished the binding of P7 to LC3C ( Figure 3 C), indicating that these two triple-residue motifs contribute to LC3C interaction. Requirement of the motifs for LC3C association was confirmed by coIP analysis in which mutation of either VLL or VIL rendered CCT2 deficient of association with LC3C ( Figure 3 D). In an in vitro pull-down assay, the WT CCT2 directly interacted with LC3C, which was abolished by the mutation of VLL and VIL ( Figure 3 E). We termed the VLL and VIL on P7 as the V-LC3-interacting region (VLIR) motif. We also examined the association with Gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor-associated protein (GABARAP) and GABARAPL1 (GL1), two ATG8 family members which also strongly associate with CCT2 ( Figure 3 A). Similarly, in peptide pull-down and coIP, the two ATG8 family members directly interacted with P7 and associated with CCT2 in a VLIR-dependent manner ( Figures S5 H and S5I). Therefore, two VLIR motifs in CCT2 account for the interaction with LC3C, GABARAP, and GL1.
Noticeably, the double VLIR-motif mutant (mVL(I)L) of CCT2 failed to promote autophagic membrane association with IBs, nor did it rescue the defect of digitonin-insoluble Q103-HTT aggregate clearance caused by CCT2 depletion ( Figures 3 F–3I). The dependence of VLIR on protein aggregate clearance was also confirmed by an imaging assay in which CCT2 but not the VLIR mutant promoted the clearance of protein aggregates/IBs ( Figures S5 J and S5K). The functional loss of the VLIR mutant may not be due to the reduction of TRiC activity because the CCT2-VLIR mutant associated with CCT4 and restored the level of α-tubulin, an indicator of TRiC activity ( Grantham et al., 2006 23. Grantham, J. ∙ Brackley, K.I. ∙ Willison, K.R. Substantial CCT activity is required for cell cycle progression and cytoskeletal organization in mammalian cells Exp. Cell Res. 2006; 312 :2309-2324 Google Scholar ), equally well with the WT CCT2 in CCT2-depleted cells ( Figures S5 L and S5M). Therefore, the data indicate that interacting with ATG8s is essential for CCT2 to promote autophagic membrane targeting and aggregate degradation.
The second part of CCT2 VLIR (VIL) is conserved in yeast ( S. cerevisiae ) ( Figure S6 A). Similar to the mammalian CCT2, the yeast Cct2 interacted with Atg8, which is dependent on VLIR, in both coIP and in vitro pull-down experiments ( Figures S6 B and S6C). In a GFP-cleavage assay ( Klionsky et al., 2016 46. Klionsky, D.J. ∙ Abdelmohsen, K. ∙ Abe, A. ... Guidelines for the use and interpretation of assays for monitoring autophagy Autophagy. 2016; 12 :1-222 Google Scholar ), Cct2 expression instead of the VLIR-mutant promoted vacuole targeting of polyQ-HTT-GFP ( Figures S6 D and S6E). The data together indicate that the aggrephagy function of CCT2 is conserved between mammals and yeast.
Two CCT2 point mutations (T400P and R516H) were reported to cause leber congenital amaurosis (LCA), a hereditary congenital retinopathy with severe macular degeneration ( Minegishi et al., 2016 65. Minegishi, Y. ∙ Sheng, X. ∙ Yoshitake, K. ... CCT2 mutations evoke Leber congenital amaurosis due to chaperone complex instability Sci. Rep. 2016; 6 :33742 Google Scholar ). Although a moderate compromise of TRiC function was proposed, the two mutants were still able to largely restore the level of α-tubulin after CCT2-depletion compared with WT CCT2 ( Figure S5 M). Instead, association with LC3C was dramatically decreased in the two mutants compared with WT CCT2, and consequently, the mutants were defective in promoting the recruitment of autophagic membrane to the IBs and Q103-HTT degradation ( Figures 3 J–3O). The mutants also failed to be degraded via the lysosome compared with the WT CCT2 in the CHX chase assay, indicating that they lost the character of the autophagy receptor ( Figure 3 N). The R516H localizes adjacent to the VIL motif ( Figure 3 J). Therefore, it may affect VIL interaction with LC3C. How T400P affects LC3C association is explored below ( Figure S7 ). Although pending further evidence, the data implies that deficiency of CCT2-mediated aggrephagy may be related to retinopathy.
CCT2 co-precipitated with the aggregation-prone proteins the turnover of which was regulated by CCT2 as shown above ( Figures 4 A–4C). This is consistent with the data that CCT2 associates with IBs of polyQ-HTT and the aggregates of Tau mutant protein ( Figures 2 A and S3 A). The CCT2 apical domain is responsible for binding to polyQ-HTT ( Figure 4 D), which echoes the previous finding that the apical domain of chaperonin subunits binds to misfolded/unfolded substrates ( Lopez et al., 2015 60. Lopez, T. ∙ Dalton, K. ∙ Frydman, J. The mechanism and function of Group II chaperonins J. Mol. Biol. 2015; 427 :2919-2930 Google Scholar ). The data indicate that, as a chaperone protein, CCT2 interacts with aggregation-prone proteins via its intrinsic ability to bind misfolded/unfolded proteins during aggrephagy.
In contrast to P62, CCT2 did not co-precipitate with polyubiquitin synthesized in vitro or from the cell lysates ( Figures 4 E and 4F). In addition, CCT2 associated with polyQ-HTT in the IB irrespective of cargo ubiquitination, as the K-R mutant of polyQ-HTT showed a similar interaction signal with the WT counterpart in the Duolink proximity ligation assay (PLA) ( Figures 4 G and 4H). Consistently, CCT2 expression promoted the lysosome-dependent clearance of polyQ-HTT K-R mutant equally well with the WT counterpart ( Figures 4 I–4K). Therefore, it is likely that CCT2 may associate with aggregation-prone proteins and promote their clearance independent of substrate ubiquitination.
Our mass spectrometry data found that the known ubiquitin-binding receptors P62, NBR1, and TAX1BP1 were enriched in IBs with high LC3 association ( Figure 1 J). To understand the relationship between CCT2 and these ubiquitin-binding receptors in aggrephagy, we determined CCT2-LC3 association, autophagic membrane recruitment, and Q103-HTT autophagic degradation in cells triply depleted of P62, NBR1, and TAX1BP1. Although we noticed a compromise of Q103-HTT degradation in the triple receptor-depleted cells without exogenous CCT2 expression ( Figure 5 C), deficiency of the three receptors did not affect CCT2-LC3C association, CCT2-promoted autophagic membrane recruitment to IBs, and CCT2-enhanced Q103-HTT clearance ( Figures 5 A–5D and S5 N). The data indicate that CCT2 acts independent of the three ubiquitin-binding receptors in regulating aggrephagy.
CMA was also reported to regulate the clearance of soluble form of aggregation-prone proteins ( Kaushik and Cuervo, 2018 39. Kaushik, S. ∙ Cuervo, A.M. The coming of age of chaperone-mediated autophagy Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2018; 19 :365-381 Google Scholar ; Lamark and Johansen, 2012 51. Lamark, T. ∙ Johansen, T.

The role of chaperone-mediated autophagy in huntingtin degradation PLoS One. 2012; 7 :e46834 Google Scholar ). Depletion of HSC70, the key chaperone receptor recognizing the KFERQ-motif of the cargoes ( Chiang et al., 1989 11. Chiang, H.L. ∙ Terlecky, S.R. ∙ Plant, C.P. ... A role for a 70-kilodalton heat shock protein in lysosomal degradation of intracellular proteins Science. 1989; 246 :382-385 Google Scholar ), did not affect the association of CCT2 with LC3C ( Figure S5 N); nor did it compromise the CCT2-promoted autophagic membrane with IBs and lysosome-dependent clearance of Q103-HTT ( Figures 5 E–5H). Together, the data indicate that CCT2 acts independently of multiple ubiquitin-binding receptors and CMA.
Liquid-liquid phase separation was shown as a transition stage before aggregation-prone proteins form solid protein aggregates ( Babinchak and Surewicz, 2020 4. Babinchak, W.M. ∙ Surewicz, W.K.

Wegmann, S. ∙ Eftekharzadeh, B. ∙ Tepper, K. ... Tau protein liquid-liquid phase separation can initiate tau aggregation EMBO J. 2018; 37 :e98049 Google Scholar ). It has been proposed that selective autophagy preferentially clears protein condensates with a certain amount of liquidity, while a solid aggregate is not a good substrate for aggrephagy ( Yamasaki et al., 2020 116. Yamasaki, A. ∙ Alam, J.M. ∙ Noshiro, D. ... Liquidity is a critical determinant for selective autophagy of protein condensates Mol. Cell. 2020; 77 :1163-1175.e9 Google Scholar ; Zhang et al., 2018 122. Zhang, G. ∙ Wang, Z. ∙ Du, Z. ... mTOR regulates phase separation of PGL granules to modulate their autophagic degradation Cell. 2018; 174 :1492-1506.e22 e1422 Google Scholar ). To determine the involvement of liquidity in CCT2-mediated clearance of protein condensates, we employed an established fused in sarcoma (FUS) liquid-to-solid transition model to generate protein condensates with different states of liquidity ( Figure 6 A; Patel et al., 2015 76. Patel, A. ∙ Lee, H.O. ∙ Jawerth, L. ... A liquid-to-solid phase transition of the ALS protein FUS accelerated by disease mutation Cell. 2015; 162 :1066-1077 Google Scholar ). By increasing the expression time of FUS with a disease mutation (P525L), we observed protein condensates with decreasing liquidity from 24- to 72-h expression based on fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) ( Figures 6 A and 6B). In the CHX chase experiment, the basal lysosome-dependent degradation of FUS (P525L) was reduced with the decrease of liquidity ( Figures 6 C–6H, compare 24, 48, and 72 h, lanes 1–4 of the IBs). This is consistent with the notion that aggregates with decreased liquidity compromise degradation via aggrephagy ( Yamasaki et al., 2020 116. Yamasaki, A. ∙ Alam, J.M. ∙ Noshiro, D. ... Liquidity is a critical determinant for selective autophagy of protein condensates Mol. Cell. 2020; 77 :1163-1175.e9 Google Scholar ; Zhang et al., 2018 122. Zhang, G. ∙ Wang, Z. ∙ Du, Z. ... mTOR regulates phase separation of PGL granules to modulate their autophagic degradation Cell. 2018; 174 :1492-1506.e22 e1422 Google Scholar ). Triple KD of P62/NBR1/TAX1BP1, but not CCT2, compromised the basal lysosome-dependent turnover of liquid FUS (P525L) (24 h), indicating that the ubiquitin-binding receptors are primarily involved in the autophagic degradation of liquid FUS (P525L) condensates ( Figures 6 K and 6L). Interestingly, expression of CCT2, instead of the VLIR mutant, enhanced the clearance of FUS (P525L) with low liquidity compared with those of high liquidity ( Figures 6 C–6H, compare 24, 48, and 72 h, lanes 1–4 versus lanes 5–8 versus lanes 9–12). Especially, CCT2 exerted the most enhancing effect of clearance on FUS (P525L) with 72-h expression in which liquidity was barely detected based on FRAP indicating the likelihood of solid state ( Figures 6 A, 6B, 6G, and 6H).
Cation-π interactions mediated by arginine and tyrosine were shown to regulate liquid-to-solid transition of FUS, and arginine methylation is an important tuner of the process ( Hofweber et al., 2018 30. Hofweber, M. ∙ Hutten, S. ∙ Bourgeois, B. ... Phase separation of FUS is suppressed by its nuclear import receptor and arginine methylation Cell. 2018; 173 :706-719.e13 Google Scholar ; Qamar et al., 2018 78. Qamar, S. ∙ Wang, G. ∙ Randle, S.J. ... FUS phase separation is modulated by a molecular chaperone and methylation of arginine cation-pi interactions Cell. 2018; 173 :720-734.e15 Google Scholar ). The FUS mutants with 16 amino acids mutated to arginine (FUS+16R) were reported to have increased liquid-to-solid transition ( Qamar et al., 2018 78. Qamar, S. ∙ Wang, G. ∙ Randle, S.J. ... FUS phase separation is modulated by a molecular chaperone and methylation of arginine cation-pi interactions Cell. 2018; 173 :720-734.e15 Google Scholar ). We employed this mutant to further confirm the reverse correlation between liquidity and CCT2-promoted clearance. Consistent with the previous study ( Qamar et al., 2018 78. Qamar, S. ∙ Wang, G. ∙ Randle, S.J. ... FUS phase separation is modulated by a molecular chaperone and methylation of arginine cation-pi interactions Cell. 2018; 173 :720-734.e15 Google Scholar ), the FUS (P525L+16R) was expressed with decreased liquidity compared with FUS (P525L) in which fluorescence recovery was barely observed (likely to be a solid state) for the FUS (P525L+16R) after 48-h expression together with reduced lysosome-dependent clearance compared with FUS (P525L) of 48-h expression ( Figures 6 A, 6B, 6E, 6F, 6I, and 6J). Again, compared with FUS (P525L), the FUS (P525L+16R) clearance was more efficiently promoted by CCT2 but not the VLIR mutant ( Figures 6 E, 6F, 6I, and 6J).
It has been shown that chaperones regulate the phase transition of aggregation-prone proteins ( Gu et al., 2020 24. Gu, J. ∙ Liu, Z. ∙ Zhang, S. ... Hsp40 proteins phase separate to chaperone the assembly and maintenance of membraneless organelles Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2020; 117 :31123-31133 Google Scholar ; Li and Liu, 2022 53. Li, D. ∙ Liu, C. Spatiotemporal dynamic regulation of membraneless organelles by chaperone networks Trends Cell Biol. 2022; 32 :1-3 Google Scholar ; Liu et al., 2020 59. Liu, Z. ∙ Zhang, S. ∙ Gu, J. ... Hsp27 chaperones FUS phase separation under the modulation of stress-induced phosphorylation Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2020; 27 :363-372 Google Scholar ). However, expression of CCT2 did not affect the liquidity of FUS (P525L) or FUS (P525L+16R) condensates, suggesting that CCT2 did not promote their clearance via altering liquid-to-solid transition ( Figures 6 A and 6B). Instead, CCT2 preferentially increased the amount of FUS (P525L) and FUS (P525L+16R) with little liquidity in the autophagosome ( Figures 6 Q and 6R). The data, together with the requirement of the VLIR motif in promoting FUS (P525L) and FUS (P525L+16R) clearance ( Figures 6 C–6J), indicate that CCT2 mediates degradation of the protein condensates via aggrephagy. Again, yeast Cct2 promoted the autophagy-dependent targeting of the solid Ape1 (P22L) instead of the liquid Ape1 (WT) in a VLIR-dependent manner ( Figures S6 F and S6G; Yamasaki et al., 2020 116. Yamasaki, A. ∙ Alam, J.M. ∙ Noshiro, D. ... Liquidity is a critical determinant for selective autophagy of protein condensates Mol. Cell. 2020; 77 :1163-1175.e9 Google Scholar ). Therefore, the CCT2 preference for condensates with little liquidity is conserved between mammals and yeast.
Different from CCT2, expression of NBR1 or TAX1BP1 enhanced the clearance of FUS (P525L) condensates with liquidity but not the solid aggregate FUS (P525L+16R) ( Figures 6 M–6P). The data, together with the KD experiments which showed the requirement of P62, NBR1, or TAX1BP1 but not CCT2 in lysosome-dependent clearance of liquid FUS (P525L) ( Figures 6 K and 6L), indicate that CCT2 and the ubiquitin-binding receptors respectively degrade protein condensates with different liquidity. The ubiquitin-binding receptors select cargoes with liquidity, whereas CCT2 prefers those with little liquidity in aggrephagy.
To explore why CCT2 preferentially enhances the clearance of FUS condensates with little liquidity, we produced granules of liquid-liquid phase separation and solid aggregates of FUS (P525L) using a previous approach ( Figures 6 S and 6T; Hofweber et al., 2018 30. Hofweber, M. ∙ Hutten, S. ∙ Bourgeois, B. ... Phase separation of FUS is suppressed by its nuclear import receptor and arginine methylation Cell. 2018; 173 :706-719.e13 Google Scholar ). In a protein recruitment assay, the CCT2 protein preferentially associated with solid aggregates compared with liquid granules in vitro ( Figure 6 U). Therefore, the data suggest that CCT2 interacts with protein condensates with little liquidity and promotes their autophagic clearance.
It has been shown that the proper function of TRiC requires all subunits ( Gestaut et al., 2019 21. Gestaut, D. ∙ Limatola, A. ∙ Joachimiak, L. ... The ATP-powered gymnastics of TRiC/CCT: an asymmetric protein folding machine with a symmetric origin story Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2019; 55 :50-58 Google Scholar ; Jin et al., 2019 36. Jin, M. ∙ Liu, C. ∙ Han, W. ... TRiC/CCT chaperonin: structure and function Subcell. Biochem. 2019; 93 :625-654 Google Scholar ). In the TRiC, CCT4 and CCT5 are two neighbors of CCT2 ( Gestaut et al., 2019 21. Gestaut, D. ∙ Limatola, A. ∙ Joachimiak, L. ... The ATP-powered gymnastics of TRiC/CCT: an asymmetric protein folding machine with a symmetric origin story Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2019; 55 :50-58 Google Scholar ; Jin et al., 2019 36. Jin, M. ∙ Liu, C. ∙ Han, W. ... TRiC/CCT chaperonin: structure and function Subcell. Biochem. 2019; 93 :625-654 Google Scholar ). To determine the involvement of TRiC complex formation in CCT2-regulated aggrephagy, we depleted CCT4 and CCT5, respectively, to disrupt the TRiC complex, which was confirmed by a reduction of α-tubulin after CCT4 or CCT5 RNAi ( Figure S7 A). CCT2 expression increased autophagic membrane association with IBs similarly in control, CCT4 KD, and CCT5 KD cells ( Figures 7 A, S7 B, and S7C). Consistently, CCT2 expression promoted lysosome-dependent Q103-HTT degradation in control and CCT4 or CCT5 KD cells ( Figures 7 B, 7C, S7 D, and S7E). The data indicate that CCT2 regulates aggrephagy independent of the integrity of the TRiC complex.
To determine the status of CCT2 in mediating aggrephagy, we analyzed the association between CCT2 and TRiC subunits in the absence and presence of Q103-HTT using a Duolink PLA assay. Interestingly, Q103-HTT expression inhibited the association between CCT2 and TRiC subunits, suggesting that accumulation of the aggregation-prone protein affects partition of CCT2 in the TRiC ( Figures 7 D and 7E). To confirm, we incubated cell lysates, in which majority of CCT2 existed in the form of TRiC complex, with Q45-CFP (1.6 μM) with a comparable concentration of Q103-HTT in the cytosol in our experiments (1.5–2.0 μM, data not shown) ( Figure 7 F). In gel-filtration, Q45-CFP protein increased CCT2 in the ∼44-KD monomer fraction by ∼3.5-fold compared with CFP ( Figure 7 G, from 3.7% to 16.3% of total CCT2 in the monomer fraction). Several other CCT subunits also appeared to increase in the non-TRiC complex fractions, suggesting partial disruption of TRiC by polyQ-HTT ( Figure 7 G). Together, the data indicate that accumulation of polyQ-HTT promotes the monomer form of CCT2 and may affect the integrity of the TRiC complex.
The VLIR motif locates in the equatorial domain of CCT2 and is buried into the TRiC complex ( Knowlton et al., 2021 47. Knowlton, J.J. ∙ Gestaut, D. ∙ Ma, B. ... Structural and functional dissection of reovirus capsid folding and assembly by the prefoldin-TRiC/CCT chaperone network Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2021; 118 e2018127118 Google Scholar ; Figure 7 H). It is likely that via dissociating from the TRiC complex, the VLIR motif is exposed and can associate with ATG8s. The notion is confirmed by a pull-down experiment in which CCT2 in the monomer instead of in the TRiC complex fraction interacted with LC3C ( Figure 7 I). In addition, the exogenously expressed CCT2 which promoted aggrephagy were primarily monomeric ( Figure 7 J). Co-expression of other TRiC subunits decreased monomeric CCT2 by forming the TRiC complex and, therefore, compromised the CCT2 association with LC3C, as well as the CCT2 promoted autophagic membrane recruitment to IBs and Q103-HTT degradation ( Figures 7 J–7N, S7 F, and S7G). We also found that in addition to CCT2, the rest of the TRiC subunits were able to associate with IBs ( Figure 7 K), which is consistent with previous studies showing that the TRiC complex and subunits localize to protein aggregates ( Behrends et al., 2006 6. Behrends, C. ∙ Langer, C.A. ∙ Boteva, R. ... Chaperonin TRiC promotes the assembly of polyQ expansion proteins into nontoxic oligomers Mol. Cell. 2006; 23 :887-897 Google Scholar ; Shahmoradian et al., 2013 90. Shahmoradian, S.H. ∙ Galaz-Montoya, J.G. ∙ Schmid, M.F. ... TRiC's tricks inhibit huntingtin aggregation Elife. 2013; 2 :e00710 Google Scholar ; Tam et al., 2006 97. Tam, S. ∙ Geller, R. ∙ Spiess, C. ... The chaperonin TRiC controls polyglutamine aggregation and toxicity through subunit-specific interactions Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8 :1155-1162 Google Scholar ). Importantly, the T400P mutation enhanced CCT2 association with CCT4 and partition into the TRiC complex ( Figures S7 H and S7I). In addition, the mutation compromised the release of CCT2 (T400P) from the TRiC complex caused by polyQ-HTT, and, therefore, decreased the ability of CCT2 to associate with LC3 and to promote aggrephagy as shown above ( Figure S7 I).
Together, the data indicate a scenario of CCT2 dissociation from the TRiC complex induced by excessive aggregation-prone proteins as a switch of chaperonin function from protein folding to autophagy. The monomeric CCT2 is able to associate with ATG8s and, therefore, acts as an autophagy receptor to promote the degradation of protein aggregates ( Figure 7 O).

Section: Discussion

It has been well-recognized that chaperones primarily function to assist protein folding ( Kim et al., 2013 42. Kim, Y.E. ∙ Hipp, M.S. ∙ Bracher, A. ... Molecular chaperone functions in protein folding and proteostasis Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2013; 82 :323-355 Google Scholar ). The current work identifies the chaperonin subunit CCT2 as an aggrephagy receptor which facilitates the clearance of aggregation-prone proteins. Therefore, the study implies a double defense mechanism of the chaperonin TRiC for proteostasis, which is likely regulated through a functional switch. It is plausible that in the presence of misfolded proteins, TRiC performs its conventional function to refold these proteins and prevent aggregation as the first line of defense. When excessive misfolded proteins accumulate to form protein aggregates, which is an indication of chaperone system exhaustion, a fraction of the TRiC subunit CCT2 becomes monomeric and switches its function to autophagy receptor as a second line of defense to maintain proteostasis ( Figure 7 O).
An induced interaction with ATG8s likely accounts for the switch of CCT2 function. The VLIR motifs are buried in the TRiC complex under steady states ( Figure 7 H). Excessive aggregation-prone protein polyQ-HTT induced the formation of CCT2 monomer, exposing the VLIR motifs and enabling it to interact with ATG8 family members ( Figures 7 G and 7I). The model is supported by the T400P mutation identified in LCA, which decreases CCT2 monomer by enhancing CCT2 distribution in the TRiC complex and, therefore, compromises ATG8s association and aggrephagy ( Figures 3 K–3M, S7 H, and S7I). It is pending to know how the T400P mutation increases CCT2 partition into the TRiC complex. Based on the structure of TRiC, threonine 400 locates on the α-helix essential for ATP hydrolysis ( Knowlton et al., 2021 47. Knowlton, J.J. ∙ Gestaut, D. ∙ Ma, B. ... Structural and functional dissection of reovirus capsid folding and assembly by the prefoldin-TRiC/CCT chaperone network Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2021; 118 e2018127118 Google Scholar ). The T400P mutation may disrupt the α-helix and affect ATP hydrolysis which consequently prolongs the closed conformation of the TRiC complex. It has been proposed that the TRiC complex may be stabilized in the closed state due to less dynamics and more interaction among eight helical protrusions at the lid of the cavity ( Kanzaki et al., 2008 38. Kanzaki, T. ∙ Iizuka, R. ∙ Takahashi, K. ... Sequential action of ATP-dependent subunit conformational change and interaction between helical protrusions in the closure of the built-in lid of group II chaperonins J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283 :34773-34784 Google Scholar ; Zang et al., 2016 120. Zang, Y. ∙ Jin, M. ∙ Wang, H. ... Staggered ATP binding mechanism of eukaryotic chaperonin TRiC (CCT) revealed through high-resolution cryo-EM Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2016; 23 :1083-1091 Google Scholar ). Therefore, the T400P mutation may stabilize the TRiC by affecting ATP hydrolysis and prolonging the time of closed conformation.
The study identifies CCT2 as an autophagy receptor. CCT2 interacts with ATG8s and aggregation-prone proteins through a non-classical VLIR motif in the equatorial domain and the apical domain, respectively ( Figures 3 and 4 ). Therefore, CCT2 promotes autophagic membrane targeting to protein aggregates and clearance of aggregation-prone proteins, the process of which is independent of the ubiquitin-binding receptors (P62, NBR1, and TAX1BP1) and CMA ( Figure 5 ). In contrast to the ubiquitin-binding autophagy receptors, CCT2 does not bind to poly-ubiquitins ( Figures 4 D and 4E). Therefore, the CCT2-mediated aggrephagy represents a way of protein aggregates clearance different from that of the ubiquitin-binding autophagy receptors. It has been shown that, in selective autophagy, autophagy receptors (e.g., NDP52 and Optineurin) recruit ULK1 complex to enhance autophagosome biogenesis in situ ( Lazarou et al., 2015 52. Lazarou, M. ∙ Sliter, D.A. ∙ Kane, L.A. ... The ubiquitin kinase PINK1 recruits autophagy receptors to induce mitophagy Nature. 2015; 524 :309-314 Google Scholar ). In addition, the phosphatidylinositol-3 phosphate binding protein ALFY also activates autophagic membrane synthesis on the aggregate via recruiting ATG5, a key component of the E3 in the ubiquitin-like conjugation system required for ATG8 lipidation ( Filimonenko et al., 2010 17. Filimonenko, M. ∙ Isakson, P. ∙ Finley, K.D. ... The selective macroautophagic degradation of aggregated proteins requires the PI3P-binding protein Alfy Mol. Cell. 2010; 38 :265-279 Google Scholar ). Furthermore, multiple post-translational modifications regulate the activity of autophagy receptors ( Gubas and Dikic, 2021 25. Gubas, A. ∙ Dikic, I. A guide to the regulation of selective autophagy receptors FEBS J. 2021; 289 :75-89 Google Scholar ). In the future, it would be interesting to know whether CCT2 is able to recruit upstream autophagic factors or is regulated by post-translational modifications during aggrephagy.
Although several studies found that liquidity is a prerequisite for autophagy-mediated clearance of protein condensates ( Agudo-Canalejo et al., 2021 1. Agudo-Canalejo, J. ∙ Schultz, S.W. ∙ Chino, H. ... Wetting regulates autophagy of phase-separated compartments and the cytosol Nature. 2021; 591 :142-146 Google Scholar ; Yamasaki et al., 2020 116. Yamasaki, A. ∙ Alam, J.M. ∙ Noshiro, D. ... Liquidity is a critical determinant for selective autophagy of protein condensates Mol. Cell. 2020; 77 :1163-1175.e9 Google Scholar ; Zhang et al., 2018 122. Zhang, G. ∙ Wang, Z. ∙ Du, Z. ... mTOR regulates phase separation of PGL granules to modulate their autophagic degradation Cell. 2018; 174 :1492-1506.e22 e1422 Google Scholar ), CCT2 promotes the degradation of protein granules with little liquidity ( Figure 6 ). The selectivity toward little liquidity could be partially explained by the fact that CCT2 associates with solid protein aggregates rather than granules of liquid-liquid phase separation ( Figure 6 U). Why does CCT2 associate with solid aggregates? It has been shown that solid protein aggregates contain misfolded proteins as well as fibers with conformation of β sheets ( Eisenberg and Jucker, 2012 16. Eisenberg, D. ∙ Jucker, M. The amyloid state of proteins in human diseases Cell. 2012; 148 :1188-1203 Google Scholar ; Vendruscolo, 2012 104. Vendruscolo, M. Proteome folding and aggregation Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2012; 22 :138-143 Google Scholar ). As a chaperone subunit, CCT2 has the intrinsic propensity to bind unfolded or misfolded proteins ( Gestaut et al., 2019 21. Gestaut, D. ∙ Limatola, A. ∙ Joachimiak, L. ... The ATP-powered gymnastics of TRiC/CCT: an asymmetric protein folding machine with a symmetric origin story Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2019; 55 :50-58 Google Scholar ; Jin et al., 2019 36. Jin, M. ∙ Liu, C. ∙ Han, W. ... TRiC/CCT chaperonin: structure and function Subcell. Biochem. 2019; 93 :625-654 Google Scholar ). In addition, the chaperonin TRiC has been shown to preferentially associate with aggregation-prone proteins with β sheets conformation ( Yam et al., 2008 115. Yam, A.Y. ∙ Xia, Y. ∙ Lin, H.T. ... Defining the TRiC/CCT interactome links chaperonin function to stabilization of newly made proteins with complex topologies Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15 :1255-1262 Google Scholar ). Therefore, the conformation of proteins in the solid aggregates may contribute to CCT2 association.
The ubiquitin-binding receptors P62 and NBR1 were shown to drive phase separation of cargoes with poly-ubiquitin chain, the process of which was proposed to facilitate autophagic clearance ( Noda et al., 2020 72. Noda, N.N. ∙ Wang, Z. ∙ Zhang, H. Liquid-liquid phase separation in autophagy J. Cell Biol. 2020; 219 e202004062 Google Scholar ; Sun et al., 2018 95. Sun, D. ∙ Wu, R. ∙ Zheng, J. ...

Phase separation in regulation of aggrephagy J. Mol. Biol. 2020; 432 :160-169 Google Scholar ; Turco et al., 2021 100. Turco, E. ∙ Savova, A. ∙ Gere, F. ... Reconstitution defines the roles of p62, NBR1 and TAX1BP1 in ubiquitin condensate formation and autophagy initiation Nat. Commun. 2021; 12 :5212 Google Scholar ; Zaffagnini et al., 2018 119. Zaffagnini, G. ∙ Savova, A. ∙ Danieli, A. ... p62 filaments capture and present ubiquitinated cargos for autophagy EMBO J. 2018; 37 :e98308 Google Scholar ). In our data, P62, NBR1, and TAX1BP1 are involved in the turnover of FUS (P525L) condensates with liquidity ( Figures 6 K–6P). These data support the notion that these ubiquitin-binding receptors are primarily responsible for the autophagic degradation of protein condensates with liquidity. Together, these pieces of evidence indicate that CCT2 and the ubiquitin-binding receptors act complementarily to clear different types of protein condensates in the process of aggrephagy.
Our data indicate that the LCA-causing mutations of CCT2 affects aggrephagy, suggesting a link between aggrephagy deficiency and retinopathy. The retina is one of the highest oxygen-consuming tissues by exposing to a microenvironment of abundant photosensitizers, visible light exposure and high energy demands. Oxidative damage has been known as a major cause of age-related macular degeneration ( Jarrett and Boulton, 2012 35. Jarrett, S.G. ∙ Boulton, M.E. Consequences of oxidative stress in age-related macular degeneration Mol. Aspects Med. 2012; 33 :399-417 Google Scholar ). Considering massive oxidative stress causes protein damage, misfolding, and aggregation, the macular cells may be easily subjected to proteotoxic stress and more liable to aggrephagy deficiency. A correlation between protein aggregate accumulation and LCA has been suggested by studies on the chaperone interacting protein AIPL1. It was shown that several of the LCA-causing AIPL1 mutants led to the accumulation of NUB1 aggregates ( Hidalgo-de-Quintana et al., 2008 28. Hidalgo-de-Quintana, J. ∙ Evans, R.J. ∙ Cheetham, M.E. ... The Leber congenital amaurosis protein AIPL1 functions as part of a chaperone heterocomplex Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2008; 49 :2878-2887 Google Scholar ; van der Spuy and Cheetham, 2004 102. van der Spuy, J. ∙ Cheetham, M.E. The Leber congenital amaurosis protein AIPL1 modulates the nuclear translocation of NUB1 and suppresses inclusion formation by NUB1 fragments J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279 :48038-48047 Google Scholar ). In the future, it will be important to know whether protein aggregation is a major cause of LCA and how CCT2-mediated aggrephagy contributes to proteostasis maintenance in retina cells. Also, considering the CCT2 mutations identified in LCA affect aggrephagy, which is essential for neuronal cell proteostasis, it would be interesting to know whether LCA patients with the CCT2 mutations have neurodegenerative disorders.
Accumulating evidence indicates that selective autophagy is compromised in neurodegeneration and its restoration has beneficial effects ( Dikic and Elazar, 2018 15. Dikic, I. ∙ Elazar, Z. Mechanism and medical implications of mammalian autophagy Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2018; 19 :349-364 Google Scholar ; Menzies et al., 2015 64. Menzies, F.M. ∙ Fleming, A. ∙ Rubinsztein, D.C. Compromised autophagy and neurodegenerative diseases Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2015; 16 :345-357 Google Scholar ; Nixon, 2013 71. Nixon, R.A. The role of autophagy in neurodegenerative disease Nat. Med. 2013; 19 :983-997 Google Scholar ; Scrivo et al., 2018 89. Scrivo, A. ∙ Bourdenx, M. ∙ Pampliega, O. ... Selective autophagy as a potential therapeutic target for neurodegenerative disorders Lancet Neurol. 2018; 17 :802-815 Google Scholar ). The notion was confirmed in principle by a recent work showing that small molecules selectively bridging the mutant HTT to autophagy degradation alleviates the neurodegenerative phenotype in a mouse model of Huntington’s disease ( Li et al., 2019 54. Li, Z. ∙ Wang, C. ∙ Wang, Z. ... Allele-selective lowering of mutant HTT protein by HTT–LC3 linker compounds Nature. 2019; 575 :203-209 Google Scholar ). Our work identifies CCT2 as an aggrephagy receptor for selective clearance of protein aggregates. Interestingly, the protein level of CCT2 was shown to be reduced in neurodegenerative brains (Huntington disease and Alzheimer disease) ( Brehme et al., 2014 9. Brehme, M. ∙ Voisine, C. ∙ Rolland, T. ... A chaperome subnetwork safeguards proteostasis in aging and neurodegenerative disease Cell Rep. 2014; 9 :1135-1150 Google Scholar ), suggesting that insufficient CCT2 may associate with neurodegeneration. Our study partially confirms the notion in another perspective by showing that expression of CCT2 reduces the amount of endogenous polyQ-HTT in mouse striatum ( Figure 2 M). Therefore, restoring CCT2 level enhances toxic protein clearance and might benefit patients with neurodegeneration. The TRiC complex and subunits have been shown to relieve polyQ-HTT toxicity by preventing aggregation and formation of toxic oligomers ( Behrends et al., 2006 6. Behrends, C. ∙ Langer, C.A. ∙ Boteva, R. ... Chaperonin TRiC promotes the assembly of polyQ expansion proteins into nontoxic oligomers Mol. Cell. 2006; 23 :887-897 Google Scholar ; Tam et al., 2006 97. Tam, S. ∙ Geller, R. ∙ Spiess, C. ... The chaperonin TRiC controls polyglutamine aggregation and toxicity through subunit-specific interactions Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8 :1155-1162 Google Scholar ). The double beneficial effects of protein aggregate detoxification and clearance make TRiC complex an enticing therapeutic target against neurodegeneration and other related diseases.
The current work suggests that multiple chaperones may be involved in regulating the autophagic clearance of protein aggregates. With a focus on CCT2, the work reveals that CCT2 acts independently of the known ubiquitin-binding receptors and specifically regulates the clearance of protein aggregates with little liquidity. In addition, the monomer formation of CCT2 regulates the switch of function between a chaperone subunit and an aggrephagy receptor. Although the current data indicate that the monomer CCT2 may be released from the chaperonin complex, they could not rule out the possibility that the newly synthesized CCT2 subunit may directly participate in aggrephagy before it assembles into the TRiC. In addition, it is still unclear how the other chaperones or subunits function in the process of aggrephagy. More work needs to be done to understand whether these chaperones or subunits act in a similar or a different mechanism with CCT2.
It is pending to know how the large IBs are cleared by the autophagosome. Several chaperones have been shown to fragment fibrils in the IB ( Gao et al., 2015 18. Gao, X. ∙ Carroni, M. ∙ Nussbaum-Krammer, C. ... Human Hsp70 disaggregase reverses parkinson's-linked α-synuclein amyloid fibrils Mol. Cell. 2015; 59 :781-793 Google Scholar ; Nachman et al., 2020 70. Nachman, E. ∙ Wentink, A.S. ∙ Madiona, K. ... Disassembly of Tau fibrils by the human Hsp70 disaggregation machinery generates small seeding-competent species J. Biol. Chem. 2020; 295 :9676-9690 Google Scholar ). The fragmented fibrils may fit into the size of the autophagysome (0.5–1.5 μm) and enable the piecemeal ( Mizushima et al., 2002 67. Mizushima, N. ∙ Ohsumi, Y. ∙ Yoshimori, T. Autophagosome formation in mammalian cells Cell Struct. Funct. 2002; 27 :421-429 Google Scholar ). In this case, multiple chaperones may cooperate to facilitate aggrephagy. Remarkably, HSP90AB1 was identified as a chaperone that associated with IBs abundantly and promoted aggrephagy without interacting with ATG8s ( Figures 1 J, 1L, and S5 D), suggesting that HSP90AB1 may act in a different manner compared with CCT2. It is pending to define whether HSP90AB1 is involved in IB fragmentation or other processes that facilitate aggregate clearance. Regarding the physiological role of CCT2, although we found that CCT2 expression can reduce the amount of polyQ-HTT in mouse brain and striatum neuron, it is unclear whether CCT2 expression is able to promote the clearance of other aggregation-prone proteins in vivo . In addition, mice models with the point mutations of CCT2 causing LCA as well as mutations of the CCT2 VLIR need to be established to understand which physiological processes are affected by the loss of CCT2-mediated aggrephagy.

HEK293T, U2OS, and N2A cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS at 37°C in 5% CO2. For induction of Q91- HTT-mCherry expression, U2OS HTT-Q91-mCherry cells were incubated with 1 μg/ml doxycycline for 24 h. For induction of Q150-HTT-GFP expression, N2A Q150-HTT-GFP cells were differentiated with 5 mM dbcAMP for 24 h followed by 1 μM ponasterone A for 48 h ( Jana et al., 2000 34.

For primary culture of mouse striatal neurons, mouse striatal neurons were dissected from newborn WT mice and incubated in 0.25% trypsin-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (Life Technologies) for 15 min at 37°C. After washing with Hank’s Buffered Salt Solution plus 5 mM Hepes (Life Technologies), 20 mM D-glucose, and 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco), the neurons were mechanically dissociated in culture medium and plated on poly-D-lysine-coated glass coverslips at a density of 50,000 to 100,000 cells/cm 2 . Cells were grown in Neurobasal-A medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with 2% B-27 (Life Technologies) and 2 mM glutamax (Life Technologies). Cultures were maintained at 37°C in a 5% CO 2 -humidified incubator. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) was added to neurons at day in vitro (DIV) 3, and the chase assay was performed as described below at DIV8.
The Hdh140Q knock-in mice were gifts from Boxun Lu ( Li et al., 2019 54. Li, Z. ∙ Wang, C. ∙ Wang, Z. ... Allele-selective lowering of mutant HTT protein by HTT–LC3 linker compounds Nature. 2019; 575 :203-209 Google Scholar ). The generation and characterization of the Hdh140Q knock-in mice have been previously described ( Menalled et al., 2003 63. Menalled, L.B. ∙ Sison, J.D. ∙ Dragatsis, I. ... Time course of early motor and neuropathological anomalies in a knock-in mouse model of Huntington's disease with 140 CAG repeats J. Comp. Neurol. 2003; 465 :11-26 Google Scholar ). The mice were housed in ventilated cages in a temperature and light regulated room in a SPF facility and received food and water ad libitum. The mouse experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees at Tsinghua University and they were in compliance with all relevant ethical regulations. Male mice of 2-month-old were used in the study.
Yeast cells were grown at 30°C in synthetic medium (SD; 0.17% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and ammonium sulfate, 0.5% ammonium sulfate, 2% glucose, and corresponding auxotrophic amino acids and vitamins), or YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% glucose). For autophagy induction, the cells were grown to mid-log phase in corresponding selective medium, and then were subjected to starvation at 30°C in nitrogen starvation medium (SD−N; 0.17% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and ammonium sulfate, 2% glucose) for the indicated time durations.
The in vitro reconstitution contains steps of protein purification, fluorescence labeling, and in vitro LC3 recruitment assay. Protein purification was described before ( Ge et al., 2013 20. Ge, L. ∙ Melville, D. ∙ Zhang, M. ... The ER-Golgi intermediate compartment is a key membrane source for the LC3 lipidation step of autophagosome biogenesis Elife. 2013; 2 :e00947 Google Scholar ; Zhang et al., 2020 124. Zhang, M. ∙ Liu, L. ∙ Lin, X. ... A translocation pathway for vesicle-mediated unconventional protein secretion Cell. 2020; 181 :637-652.e15 Google Scholar ). In brief, His-tagged LC3 protein with a cysteine interaction in the N-terminus for fluorophore maleimide labeling was expressed in E.coli BL21 and purified using Nickel Sepharose (GE). The LC3 protein was labeled with Alexa Fluor 647/488 C2 maleimide (Invitrogen) according to the manual provided and subsequently gel filtrated to remove the unlabeled fluorophore. For in vitro reconstitution of LC3 recruitment to the IBs in the cell, U2OS HTT-Q91-mCherry or N2A HTT-Q150-GFP cells were plated on a coverslip (for immunofluorescence), and fluorescence-tagged PolyQ-HTT IBs were induced for 24-48 h. The cells were then treated with 40 μg/ml digitonin on ice to permeabilize the plasma membrane, incubated with 5-10 μg/ml fluorescence-labeled LC3 for 1 h at 30 °C, and fixed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for microscopy analysis. For in vitro reconstitution of LC3 to IB in solution, the cells with IBs were harvested and lysed in B88 (20mM HEPES (pH 7.2), 250 mM sorbitol, 150 mM potassium acetate, 5mM magnesium acetate) with 1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitors, DNase and RNase. The lysate was centrifuged at 300 xg. The pellet containing the IBs was collected and incubated with 5-10 μg/ml fluorescence-labeled LC3 for 1 h at 30 °C after which FACS was performed to analyze LC3 recruitment to IBs as further described below.
To analyze LC3 recruitment to IBs or sort two groups of IBs (High-LC3 IB and Low-LC3 IB), U2OS HTT-Q91-mCherry or N2A HTT-Q150-GFP cells were plated in 10 cm dishes and fluorescence-tagged PolyQ-HTT IB was induced for 24-48 h as described above. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed in B88 with 1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitors, DNase, and RNase by passaging through a 22G needle for 10 times. The lysate was then centrifuged at 300 xg for 10 min. The pellet containing the IBs was collected and incubated with 0.5-1 μg/ml fluorescence-labeled LC3 in B88 with protease inhibitors for 1 h at 30 °C. The reaction mixture was centrifuged at 1000 xg for 5 min and suspended in B88 with 1% Triton X-100 to wash the pellet, followed by centrifugation at 1000 xg for 5 min. Finally, the pellet was suspended in B88 with 1% Triton X-100 and FACS analysis (PulSA, BD Fortessa) or sorting (BD Influx) was performed as described previously with modifications described in figure legends ( Ramdzan et al., 2013 80. Ramdzan, Y.M. ∙ Wood, R. ∙ Hatters, D.M. Pulse shape analysis (PulSA) to track protein translocalization in cells by flow cytometry: applications for polyglutamine aggregation Methods Mol. Biol. 2013; 1017 :85-93 Google Scholar ). After sorting, the IB solutions were centrifuged at 3000 xg for 30 min, and pellet were analyzed by immunoblot or mass spectrometry in Taplin Biological Mass Spectrometry Facility at Harvard Medical School.
To quantify the known receptors and CCT2 on IBs or in cells, N2A HTT-Q150-GFP cells were plated in 10 cm dishes and fluorescence-tagged PolyQ-HTT IB was induced for 48 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed in HB1 buffer (20 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 400 mM Sucrose, 1 mM EDTA) with 1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitors, DNase, and RNase by passaging through a 22G needle for 10 times. The lysate was then centrifuged at 300 xg for 10 min. The pellet containing the IBs was suspended with PBS. IBs or IB-positive cells were sorted by BD FACSAria SORP. After sorting, the IBs and cell solutions were centrifuged at 3000 xg for 30 min. Mass spectrometry analysis was performed at the Protein Chemistry and Proteomics Center at Tsinghua University. In brief, the IB proteins (IB group) and total cell proteins (cell group) were resolved in SDS-PAGE and stained by Simply Blue (Invitrogen). The lanes were excised from the gel, reduced, alkylated, and digested with trypsin overnight. The resulting tryptic peptides were analyzed using an UltiMate 3000 RSLCnano System (Thermo Scientific, USA) which was directly interfaced with a Thermo Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). The RAW files were searched against the Mouse Proteome (Uniprot) database using an in-house Proteome Discoverer 2.3 searching algorithm. The peak area was used for protein abundance comparison between the IB group and the cell group. The iBAQ value calculated by Maxquant was used to estimate the protein content in IB group.
Q91-HTT-mcherry plasmid was a gift from Dr. Kirill Bersuker ( Bersuker et al., 2016 7. Bersuker, K. ∙ Brandeis, M. ∙ Kopito, R.R.

The CCT1-8 encoding genes were PCR amplified from HEK293T cDNA and inserted into the FUGW vector with different tags at the N-terminus. Mutagenesis was formed by PCR. ATG8 family protein genes were amplified by PCR and inserted into the plasmids for mammalian expression. HSPA9, HSPD1, HSP90AA1, HSPA4L, HSPH1, DNAJA3, DNAJB2, PPIA, and STIP1 plasmids were purchased from Sinobiological, and HSP90AB1 plasmid from Addgene. The VCP and ANAPC7 were PCR amplified from templates (VCP from Dr. Bao-Liang Song, ANAPC7 from Sinobiological). The HSP90B1 was described as previously ( Zhang et al., 2020 124. Zhang, M. ∙ Liu, L. ∙ Lin, X. ... A translocation pathway for vesicle-mediated unconventional protein secretion Cell. 2020; 181 :637-652.e15 Google Scholar ).
For siRNAs, the targeting sequences for human CCT2, CCT4, CCT5, ATG5, Beclin1, P62, NBR1, TAX1BP1, and HSC70 were shown above. An equimolar mixture of different siRNAs for a specific gene was used to induce gene silencing. AllStars negative siRNA (GenePharma) was used as a control.
Cells were transfected with indicated plasmids. After transfection for the indicated times (in Figure legends), cells were treated with 50 μg/ml CHX, with or without 0.5 μg/ml Bafilomycin A1 as indicated and were collected at each indicated time point for immunoblot analysis. For the insoluble Q103-HTT detection, cells were permeabilized with 40 μg/ml of digitonin diluted in PBS on ice for 5 min and washed with PBS before being collected for immunoblot analysis.
AAV with CCT2 or mCherry gene cassette was delivered to the striatum. Briefly, Hdh140Q mice were anesthetized by an i.p. injection with avertin and immobilized on rodent stereotaxic frames. A burr hole was used to perforate the skull, and the AAVs (400nl per injection spot, 5 x10 12 vg/ml) were injected into the striatum using a 10 μl syringe at a rate of 50 nl/min. The injection coordinates were Anterior/Posterior (AP) +0.9mm, Medial/Lateral (ML) +/- 1.8 mm from the bregma, and Dorsal/Ventral (DV) -2.7 mm from the dura. Striatal tissues of Hdh140Q mice were carefully removed for immunoblot analyses at 2 months post AAV injection.
The His-T7-LC3C/GABARAP/GABARAPL1, His-CFP/Q45-CFP, His-mRuby2/mRuby2-CCT2, and MBP-TEV-GFP-FUS P525L proteins were purified using Ni sepharose (GE Healthcare), and the GST, GST-HA-CCT2s, and GST-P62 proteins were purified using Glutathione beads as described before ( Zhang et al., 2020 124.

Co-immunoprecipitation was performed essentially as described before ( Zhang et al., 2015 123. Zhang, M. ∙ Kenny, S.J. ∙ Ge, L. ... Translocation of interleukin-1β into a vesicle intermediate in autophagy-mediated secretion Elife. 2015; 4 :e11205 Google Scholar ). In brief, 24 h after transfection, the cells were collected and lysed on ice for 30 min in co-IP buffer (50 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP40) with protease inhibitor mixture, and the lysates were cleared by centrifugation. The resulting supernatants were incubated with indicated agarose or magnetic beads and rotated at 4°C for 3 h. The agarose was washed five times with co-IP buffer. As for the BFP-tagged Q103, the supernatants were incubated with rabbit anti-BFP antibodies and Protein A/G PLUS-Agarose according to the manufacturers’ protocol. After washing, 2×SDS loading buffer was added to the beads, and immunoblot was performed as described previously ( Xiao et al., 2019 114. Xiao, J. ∙ Luo, J. ∙ Hu, A. ... Cholesterol transport through the peroxisome-ER membrane contacts tethered by PI(4,5)P2 and extended synaptotagmins Sci. China Life Sci. 2019; 62 :1117-1135 Google Scholar ).
For peptide pull-down assay, synthetic peptides were conjugated to agarose beads using the AminoLink Plus Coupling Resin (Thermo, Cat# 20501) according to the manufacturers’ protocol. 2 μg purified T7-tagged LC3C/GABARAP/GABARAPL1 proteins were incubated with 15 μl peptides-coupled beads in co-IP buffer and rotated at 4°C for 3 h. Then the agarose was washed three times with co-IP buffer. After washing, 2×SDS loading buffer was added to the beads, and immunoblot was performed as described previously ( Xiao et al., 2019 114.

For in vitro protein pull-down assay, 20 μg purified His-T7-LC3C protein was incubated with 20 μl Ni sepharose in PBS for 1 h on a rotor at 4 °C. After washing, the beads were incubated with 5 μg GST-CCT2s proteins or the fractions after gel-filtration for 3 h on a rotor at 4 °C. After washing, 2×SDS loading buffer was added to the beads, and immunoblot was performed. As for the GST-pull down of polyubiquitin chains, 200 pmol purified GST or GST tagged proteins were incubated with Glutathione beads in co-IP buffer for 2 h on a rotor at 4 °C. After washing, the beads were incubated with 5 pmol Ub8 protein or the cell lysate from MG132 treated HEK293T cells for 3 h on a rotor at 4 °C.

Immunofluorescence was performed as previously described ( Zhang et al., 2015 123. Zhang, M. ∙ Kenny, S.J. ∙ Ge, L. ... Translocation of interleukin-1β into a vesicle intermediate in autophagy-mediated secretion Elife. 2015; 4 :e11205 Google Scholar ). In brief, when needed to be permeabilized to remove soluble component before fixation as described in figure legends, the cells were permeabilized with 40 μg/ml of digitonin diluted in PBS on ice for 5 min, washed once with cold PBS and immediately incubated with 4% PFA for 20 min at room temperature. In other cases, the cells were washed once with PBS and directly incubated with 4% PFA for 20 min at room temperature. The cells were further permeabilized with 50 μg/ml of digitonin diluted in PBS at room temperature for 10 min followed by blocking with 10% FBS diluted with PBS for 1 h and primary antibody incubation for 1 h. The cells were washed three times with PBS, followed by secondary antibody incubation for 1 h at room temperature. Fluorescence images were acquired using the Olympus FV3000 confocal microscope. Quantification was performed using ImageJ software.
Duolink PLA was performed as described previously ( Zhang et al., 2020 124. Zhang, M. ∙ Liu, L. ∙ Lin, X. ... A translocation pathway for vesicle-mediated unconventional protein secretion Cell. 2020; 181 :637-652.e15 Google Scholar ). In brief, 24h after transfection, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 diluted in PBS at room temperature. The cell was blocked with 10% FBS, incubated with primary antibodies and PLA probes followed by ligation and amplification using the recommended conditions according to the manual. Images were captured by Olympus FV3000 confocal microscope, and the quantification was performed using ImageJ software.
For EM, U2OS cells were co-transfected with Q103-HTT-GFP and either empty plasmids or HA-CCT2. 24-48 h after transfection, cells were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 1h at room temperature and washed 3 ×15 min with 0.1M PB (0.02M NaH2PO4, 0.08M Na2HPO4, PH 7.4). Post-fixation staining was performed with 1% osmium tetroxide (SPI, 1250423) for 0.5 h on ice. Cells were washed 3 ×15 min with ultrapure water, and then placed in 1% aqueous uranyl acetate (EMS, 22400) at 4 °C overnight. Samples were then washed 3 ×15 min with ultrapure water, and dehydrated in a cold-graded ethanol series (50%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%, 100%, 100%; 2min in each). Penetrating in EPON 812 resin using 1:1 (v/v) resin and ethanol for 8 h, 2:1 (v/v) resin and ethanol for 8 h, 3:1 (v/v) resin and ethanol for 8 h, then pure resin 2 × 8 h and finally into fresh resin and polymerisation in oven at 60 °C for 48 h. Embedded samples were sliced into 80-nm-thick sections and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate (C1813156). Samples were imaged under the H-7650 80kv transmission electron microscope.
For CLEM, U2OS cells were seeded in a gridded glass bottom dish (Cellvis, D35-14-1.5GI), and co-transfected with Q103-HTT-BFP, GFP-CCT2, and mcherry-LC3. 24 h after transfection, cells were fixed with 4% PFA for 20 min at room temperature. Fluorescence images were captured by Olympus FV3000 confocal microscope. The cell shape and the position of ROI were acquired and recorded under bright field. After imaging, the cells were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 1 h at room temperature. Samples for TEM were prepared as described above. The grids were engraved on the resin surface allowing for the location of ROIs on the resin surface. The samples of ROI were cut into 80-nm-thick sections. Stained sections were observed with the H-7650 80kv transmission electron microscope. Finally, the fluorescence images and TEM images were overlaid using Zeiss Zen Blue software.
For APEX2-DAB staining, U2OS cells were pre-transfected with siRNA against Atg5 before, or post-treated with 5 μM SAR405 for 12h after Q103-HTT-APEX2 and HA-CCT2 expression. Cells were fixed with room temperature 2.5% glutaraldehyde in buffer (100 mM sodium cacodylate with 2 mM CaCl2, pH7.4) and quickly moved to ice. Cells were kept between 0 and 4°C for all subsequent steps until resin infiltration. After 30 min, cells were rinsed 5 × 2 min in chilled buffer, and then treated for 5 min in buffer containing 20 mM glycine to quench unreacted glutaraldehyde followed by 5 × 2 min rinses in chilled buffer. A freshly diluted solution of 0.5 mg/ml (1.4 mM) DAB tetrahydrochloride ((Sigma, 32750) was combined with 0.03% (v/v) (10 mM) H2O2 in chilled buffer, and the solution was added to cells for 5 min. To halt the reaction, the DAB solution was removed, and cells were rinsed 5 × 5 min with chilled buffer. Samples for TEM were prepared as described above. DAB-stained areas of embedded cultured cells were identified by transmitted light and cut into 80-nm-thick sections. The samples were observed with the H-7650 80kv transmission electron microscope.
The procedure is modified from our previous work ( Ge et al., 2013 20. Ge, L. ∙ Melville, D. ∙ Zhang, M. ... The ER-Golgi intermediate compartment is a key membrane source for the LC3 lipidation step of autophagosome biogenesis Elife. 2013; 2 :e00947 Google Scholar ). HEK293T cells were transfected with indicated plasmids and harvested after 24 hours. Cells were then homogenized in a 2x cell pellet volume of HB1 buffer plus a cocktail of protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) and 0.3 mM DTT by passing through a 22G needle until ∼85% lysis analyzed by Trypan Blue staining. Homogenates were subjected to sequential differential centrifugation at 3,000 xg (10 min) and 25,000 xg (20 min) to achieve the 25,000 xg membrane pellet (25K). The 25K pellet was suspended in 0.25 ml 1.25 M sucrose buffer and overlaid with 0.25 ml 1.1 M and 0.2 ml 0.25 M sucrose buffer (Golgi isolation kit; Sigma). Centrifugation was performed at 120,000 xg for 2 h (TLS 55 rotor, Beckman), after which two fractions, one at the interface between 0.25 M and 1.1 M sucrose (L fraction) and the pellet on the bottom (P fraction), were separated. The L fraction which contained the highest level of LC3 II was suspended in 0.2 ml 19% OptiPrep for a step gradient containing 0.1 ml 22.5%, 0.2 ml 19% (sample), 0.18 ml 16%, 0.18 ml 12%, 0.2 ml 8%, 0.1 ml 5% and 0.04 ml 0% OptiPrep each each. Each density of OptiPrep was prepared by diluting 60% OptiPrep (20 mM Tricine-KOH, pH 7.4, 42 mM sucrose and 1mM EDTA) with a buffer containing 20 mM Tricine-KOH, pH 7.4, 250 mM sucrose and 1mM EDTA. The OptiPrep gradient was centrifuged at 150,000 xg for 3 h (TLS 55 rotor, Beckman) and subsequently ten fractions, 0.1 ml each, were collected from the top. 5x SDS loading buffer was added to the fractions, and immunoblot was performed with the indicated antibodies.
The autophagosome fractions from membrane fractionation were collected and suspended in B88 buffer and divided into three fractions (without proteinase K, with proteinase K (80 μg/ml), and with proteinase K and 0.5% Triton X-100) 20 μL per fraction. The reactions were performed on ice for 20 min and stopped by adding PMSF and 2x SDS loading buffer. The samples were immediately heated at 100°C for 10 min, and immunoblot was performed with the indicated antibodies.
The Filter Trap assay was performed according to a described protocol ( Sin et al., 2018 93. Sin, O. ∙ Mata-Cabana, A. ∙ Seinstra, R.I. ... Filter retardation assay for detecting and quantifying polyglutamine aggregates using Caenorhabditis elegans Lysates Bio Protoc. 2018; 8 :e3042 Google Scholar ). In Brief, cells were collected and lysed in FTA lysis buffer (10mM Tris-HCl, PH 8.0, 150mM NaCl, 2% SDS, 50mM DTT) and heated at 100°C for 10 min. The filter papers and 0.2 μm pore size cellulose acetate membrane (Sterlitech) were soaked in FTA wash buffer (10mM Tris-HCl, PH 8.0, 150mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS), and placed on the base of the MINIFOLD I 96 well Dot-Blot System (GE Healthcare), with the cellulose acetate membrane on top of the filter papers. After washing wells with FTA wash buffer, samples were loaded and washed with FTA wash buffer, each step above were applied vacuum until the wells were empty. Following immunodetection of protein aggregates on cellulose acetate membrane was the same as immunoblot.
FRAP experiments were performed on Olympus FV3000 confocal microscope. FUS condensates were bleached for 5 s using a laser intensity of 80% at 480 nm. Recovery was recorded for the indicated time durations. The fluorescence intensity of the photobleached area was normalized to the intensity of the unbleached area.
For phase separation, 2 μM MBP-TEV-GFP-FUS P525L proteins were digested with TEV in phase separation buffer (40mM Tris/HCl PH7.4, 150mM KCl, 2.5% glycerol) for 1 hour. For aggregation, the proteins were shaked at 700 rpm in a shaker at 25°C after TEV digestion ( Hofweber et al., 2018 30. Hofweber, M. ∙ Hutten, S. ∙ Bourgeois, B. ... Phase separation of FUS is suppressed by its nuclear import receptor and arginine methylation Cell. 2018; 173 :706-719.e13 Google Scholar ). The products were transferred into 384-well glass bottom plate, 4 μM mRuby2 or mRuby2-CCT2 proteins were added and incubated for 5 min before imaging.
For the GFP-47Q cleavage assay, yeast strains with GFP-47Q plasmids were grown to OD600 = 0.8 ∼ 1.0 in full medium and treated with Cu 2+ for 2 hours, and then treated with nitrogen starvation condition for the indicated time durations.
For the Ape1 cleavage assay, yeast strains were grown to OD600 = 0.8 ∼ 1.0 in YPD medium and treated with nitrogen starvation condition for the indicated time durations.

Yi, C. ∙ Ma, M. ∙ Ran, L. ... Function and molecular mechanism of acetylation in autophagy regulation Science. 2012; 336 :474-477 Google Scholar ).
The cells were collected and lysed on ice for 30 min in co-IP buffer with protease inhibitor mixture, and the lysates were cleared by centrifugation. The supernatants were injected into a Superose 6 Increase 10/300 GL (GE Healthcare) exclusion column in an AKTA FPLC system (GE Healthcare).
