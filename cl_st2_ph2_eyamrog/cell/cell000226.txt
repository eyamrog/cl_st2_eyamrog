Title: A MicroRNA Linking Human Positive Selection and Metabolic Disorders


Abstract: Summary

Positive selection in Europeans at the 2q21.3 locus harboring the lactase gene has been attributed to selection for the ability of adults to digest milk to survive famine in ancient times. However, the 2q21.3 locus is also associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes in humans, raising the possibility that additional genetic elements in the locus may have contributed to evolutionary adaptation to famine by promoting energy storage, but which now confer susceptibility to metabolic diseases. We show here that the miR-128-1 microRNA, located at the center of the positively selected locus, represents a crucial metabolic regulator in mammals. Antisense targeting and genetic ablation of miR-128-1 in mouse metabolic disease models result in increased energy expenditure and amelioration of high-fat-diet-induced obesity and markedly improved glucose tolerance. A thrifty phenotype connected to miR-128-1-dependent energy storage may link ancient adaptation to famine and modern metabolic maladaptation associated with nutritional overabundance.

Section: Introduction

The extremely long (∼1 Mb) haplotype on human chromosome 2 ( 2q21.3 ) represents a classic example of positive selection, where a large chromosome segment containing genetic variants has risen to high frequency among European populations over the last several thousand years, presumably due to selection for traits associated with a survival advantage ( Bersaglieri et al., 2004 11.

The 2q21.3 locus harbors the lactase gene ( LCT ), encoding the enzyme lactase-phlorizin hydrolase, which hydrolyzes lactose and is expressed in the small intestine of infants allowing digestion of breast milk ( Swallow, 2003 94. Swallow, D.M. Genetics of lactase persistence and lactose intolerance Annu. Rev. Genet. 2003; 37 :197-219 Crossref Scopus (346) PubMed Google Scholar ). Intestinal expression of lactase is typically shut off after weaning in mammals. However, the long 2q21.3 haplotype in Europeans is strongly linked to expression of intestinal lactase into adulthood (termed lactase persistence [LP]), allowing adult milk consumption ( Gerbault et al., 2011 24. Gerbault, P. ∙ Liebert, A. ∙ Itan, Y. ... Evolution of lactase persistence: an example of human niche construction Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol.

Genet. 2017; 18 :297-319 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ). The signature European LP single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs4988235, is present in an intronic enhancer in the MCM6 gene, which is located just upstream of the LCT gene.
LP has been postulated to have provided a selective advantage in nutrient-deprived populations and at higher latitudes with decreased sunlight due to supplementation of calcium and vitamin D3 to support proper bone formation and calcification ( Flatz and Rotthauwe, 1973 21. Flatz, G. ∙ Rotthauwe, H.W. Lactose nutrition and natural selection Lancet. 1973; 2 :76-77 Abstract PubMed Google Scholar ). However, other dietary sources might have provided sufficient sources of such nutrients ( Itan et al., 2009 35. Itan, Y. ∙ Powell, A. ∙ Beaumont, M.A. ... The origins of lactase persistence in Europe PLoS Comput. Biol. 2009; 5 :e1000491 Crossref Scopus (285) PubMed Google Scholar ). The current prevailing theory has posited that adult consumption of fresh milk among herding populations would have allowed additional calorie intake to produce a survival advantage during famines ( Sverrisdóttir et al., 2014 93. Sverrisdóttir, O.O. ∙ Timpson, A. ∙ Toombs, J. ... Direct estimates of natural selection in Iberia indicate calcium absorption was not the only driver of lactase persistence in Europe Mol. Biol. Evol. 2014; 31 :975-983 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, fresh milk is highly susceptible to microbial degradation, and from archeological records it is clear that farmers and herders in ancient times knew well how to preserve milk products through the generation of butter, yogurt, and cheese products, where much of the lactose is removed or consumed ( Curry, 2013 18. Curry, A. Archaeology: The milk revolution Nature. 2013; 500 :20-22 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Salque et al., 2013 75. Salque, M. ∙ Bogucki, P.I. ∙ Pyzel, J. ...

Ségurel, L. ∙ Bon, C. On the Evolution of Lactase Persistence in Humans Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2017; 18 :297-319 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ). Studies of ancient DNA have also shown that steppe populations lacked the rs4988235 LP SNP for thousands of years yet were known to be herders and exhibited evidence of consumption of milk products ( Jeong et al., 2018 36. Jeong, C. ∙ Wilkin, S. ∙ Amgalantugs, T. ... Bronze Age population dynamics and the rise of dairy pastoralism on the eastern Eurasian steppe Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115 :E11248-E11255 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ; Mathiesen et al., 2015 54. Mathieson, I. ∙ Lazaridis, I. ∙ Rohland, N. ... Genome-wide patterns of selection in 230 ancient Eurasians Nature. 2015; 528 :499-503 Crossref Scopus (506) PubMed Google Scholar ). Hence, individuals among herding populations, even those with moderate lactose intolerance, should have been able to consume stored milk products during most famines.
Challenged by severe and prolonged famines that would generate strong selective pressure, increased energy efficiency and fat storage among human populations might also have provided a selective advantage for survival and propagation, perhaps in cooperation with the ability of adults to consume milk. While potentially beneficial in times of famine frequent after the transition from hunting and gathering to agriculture, this “thrifty gene” trait may now represent a metabolic maladaptation predisposing to obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes (T2D) ( Neel, 1962 60. Neel, J.V. Diabetes mellitus: a “thrifty” genotype rendered detrimental by “progress”? Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1962; 14 :353-362 PubMed Google Scholar ).
Support for the possibility of a “thrifty” genotype-phenotype link comes from the fact that several genetic variants across the locus have also been linked to metabolic abnormalities and diseases associated with decreased energy expenditure, such as obesity and T2D, as well as abnormal blood metabolites and lipids ( Albuquerque et al., 2013 2.

For example, a meta-analysis of 31,720 individuals from diverse European populations showed a statistically significant (p = 7.9 × 10 −5 ) elevation of body mass index (BMI, kg/m 2 ) associated with the positively selected allele of the rs4988235 SNP ( Kettunen et al., 2010 42. Kettunen, J. ∙ Silander, K. ∙ Saarela, O. ... European lactase persistence genotype shows evidence of association with increase in body mass index Hum. Mol. Genet. 2010; 19 :1129-1136 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Increased ectopic fat storage in liver and skeletal muscle represent strong risk factors for the development of insulin resistance and T2D ( Shulman, 2014 84. Shulman, G.I. Ectopic fat in insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and cardiometabolic disease N. Engl. J. Med. 2014; 371 :1131-1141 Crossref Scopus (290) PubMed Google Scholar ). In support of a link of the 2q21.3 locus to T2D, two genome-wide association studies (GWASs) coupled to metabolomics also reported an association of SNPs across this locus with altered levels of 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG), a metabolite linked to abnormal glucose homeostasis and T2D ( Kim and Park, 2013 44. Kim, W.J. ∙ Park, C.Y. 1,5-Anhydroglucitol in diabetes mellitus Endocrine. 2013; 43 :33-40 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Shin et al., 2014 82. Shin, S.Y. ∙ Fauman, E.B. ∙ Petersen, A.K. ..., Multiple Tissue Human Expression Resource (MuTHER) Consortium An atlas of genetic influences on human blood metabolites Nat.

Suhre, K. ∙ Shin, S.Y. ∙ Petersen, A.K. ..., CARDIoGRAM Human metabolic individuality in biomedical and pharmaceutical research Nature. 2011; 477 :54-60 Crossref Scopus (643) PubMed Google Scholar ). Hence, the long haplotype at 2q21.3 is linked to both LP and metabolic aberrations, which may reflect positive selection for multiple cooperative traits (ability to consume milk in adulthood and increased fat storage) that together could have conferred a strong survival advantage during severe famines.
The genetic and molecular underpinnings for the association of the locus with obesity and T2D have remained obscure. It is possible that these additional associations with metabolic aberrations could be explained by one or multiple genetic elements present in the locus. While obesity has a clear genetic component in humans ( Allison et al., 1996 3. Allison, D.B. ∙ Kaprio, J. ∙ Korkeila, M. ...

Med. 2017; 377 :13-27 Crossref Scopus (2063) PubMed Google Scholar ), meta-analysis of a number of genetic studies linking genetic loci to obesity failed to uncover strong support for single obesity genes producing a selective advantage ( Speakman, 2013 88.

To date, the majority of genotype-phenotype studies in humans have focused on protein coding genes; however, microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as crucial regulators of the expression of hundreds of genes, often controlling the output of entire biological pathways ( Ambros, 2004 5.

We and others have uncovered several miRNAs as crucial metabolic regulators ( Goedeke et al., 2016 26.

Rottiers, V. ∙ Näär, A.M. MicroRNAs in metabolism and metabolic disorders Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2012; 13 :239-250 Crossref Scopus (748) PubMed Google Scholar ). We previously employed an unbiased analysis of GWAS data from >188,000 individuals to identify miRNAs associated with abnormal blood lipids ( Wagschal et al., 2015 98. Wagschal, A. ∙ Najafi-Shoushtari, S.H. ∙ Wang, L. ... Genome-wide identification of microRNAs regulating cholesterol and triglyceride homeostasis Nat. Med. 2015; 21 :1290-1297 Crossref Scopus (176) PubMed Google Scholar ). These studies uncovered miR-128-1 as a critical regulator of circulating total cholesterol in vivo in mice ( Wagschal et al., 2015 98. Wagschal, A. ∙ Najafi-Shoushtari, S.H. ∙ Wang, L. ... Genome-wide identification of microRNAs regulating cholesterol and triglyceride homeostasis Nat. Med. 2015; 21 :1290-1297 Crossref Scopus (176) PubMed Google Scholar ). Importantly, miR-128-1 is an intronic miRNA present in the R3HDM1 gene, which is located at the center of the positively selected locus on human chromosome 2, approximately 200 kb from the LCT gene. Given the strong link of miR-128-1 to the GWAS association with cholesterol/lipid abnormalities ( Wagschal et al., 2015 98. Wagschal, A. ∙ Najafi-Shoushtari, S.H. ∙ Wang, L. ... Genome-wide identification of microRNAs regulating cholesterol and triglyceride homeostasis Nat. Med. 2015; 21 :1290-1297 Crossref Scopus (176) PubMed Google Scholar ), and the prediction that it might regulate expression of genes involved in metabolic control ( www.targetscan.org ), we sought to further evaluate whether miR-128-1 represents a metabolic miRNA that could have contributed to the association of the long haplotype on human chromosome 2 with metabolic diseases and positive selection.

Section: Results

We began by examining the haplotype structure of 2q21.3 in Europeans, where we observed that there is a well-studied, strong selection signal across a long haplotype centered on the R3HDM1 gene ( Figure 1 A; Figure S1 A). This selection signal is directly attributed to the LP phenotype associated with the previously reported tag SNP rs4988235. We note a strong metabolic association at the locus from our previous work detailing a lipid association with expression of miR-128-1 ( Wagschal et al., 2015 98. Wagschal, A. ∙ Najafi-Shoushtari, S.H. ∙ Wang, L. ... Genome-wide identification of microRNAs regulating cholesterol and triglyceride homeostasis Nat. Med. 2015; 21 :1290-1297 Crossref Scopus (176) PubMed Google Scholar ) present in the R3HDM1 gene. In light of this, along with the apparent selection signal associated with SNPs in R3HDM1 near miR-128-1 (e.g., rs1446585, Figure 1 A), we examined the selection signal across species in more detail by performing a literature search to identify species exhibiting selection at the 2q21.3 syntenic locus and, if so, whether there is evidence for a metabolic association.
Interestingly, the 2q21.3 syntenic locus in cattle has been shown in GWAS to be associated with increased feed efficiency (thrifty phenotype) and increased intramuscular fat (both are associated with the miR-128-1 host gene R3HDM1 ), desirable traits in cattle breeding ( Barendse et al., 2009 7.

Evol. 2018; 35 :688-699 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ). There is also considerable genetic variation at the locus between breeds, potentially indicative of either artificial or natural selection ( Gibbs et al., 2009 25. Gibbs, R.A. ∙ Taylor, J.F. ∙ Van Tassell, C.P. ..., Bovine HapMap Consortium Genome-wide survey of SNP variation uncovers the genetic structure of cattle breeds Science. 2009; 324 :528-532 Crossref Scopus (569) PubMed Google Scholar ). Recent work indicates a selection signal in canids as well, centered on the promoter of R3HDM1 (XP-EHH 1.02, p = 0.0056; Plassais et al., 2019 67. Plassais, J. ∙ Kim, J. ∙ Davis, B.W. ... Whole genome sequencing of canids reveals genomic regions under selection and variants influencing morphology Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :1489 Crossref Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ). This selection signal on the derived allele is also associated with a 14.5 kg increase in body weight (p = 2.17 × 10 −13 ) and is observed exclusively in large breeds with the “bulky” phenotype. Together, these data suggest a complex history of shared natural and artificial selection on multiple metabolic phenotypes at the 2q21.3 locus ( Figure 1 B).
We note that cattle and dogs are weaned and do not consume milk in adulthood. This makes it unlikely that LP would have contributed to the observed differences in body mass among bovine breeds and modern canids, which suggests other mechanisms might be at play. Given this, we performed a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) using data from the UK Biobank and found that European long haplotype 2q21.3 variants are associated with diverse body-fat-related traits ( Figure 1 C), including overall body fat percentage/mass, trunk fat percentage/mass, and leg fat percentage/mass. This is supported by independent (non-UKBB) datasets, where we found robust associations at this locus with a number of metabolic traits, including strong associations with total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and 1,5-AG, and we verified the positive selection at the locus using the singleton density score ( Field et al., 2016 20. Field, Y. ∙ Boyle, E.A. ∙ Telis, N. ... Detection of human adaptation during the past 2000 years Science. 2016; 354 :760-764 Crossref Scopus (137) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S1 B). We also examined other LP selection signals and found lipid associations consistent with the effects observed on the European haplotype ( Figure S1 C). We found tight linkage across ancient DNA samples in Europe, confirming the haplotype was selected as a whole ( Mathieson and Mathieson, 2018 53. Mathieson, S. ∙ Mathieson, I. FADS1 and the Timing of Human Adaptation to Agriculture Mol. Biol. Evol. 2018; 35 :2957-2970 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 1 D), and consistent with the observed shift in allele frequencies across the locus in present-day Europeans ( Figure S1 D).
To explore which cell types are most likely responsible for the association with metabolic traits at this locus, we considered variants at the whole extended haplotype. Analyzing chromatin state maps across 127 human cell types from the Roadmap ( Kundaje et al., 2015 47. Kundaje, A. ∙ Meuleman, W. ∙ Ernst, J. ..., Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium Integrative analysis of 111 reference human epigenomes Nature. 2015; 518 :317-330 Crossref Scopus (2660) PubMed Google Scholar ) and ENCODE ( Hoffman et al., 2013 32.

Integrative annotation of chromatin elements from ENCODE data Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41 :827-841 Crossref Scopus (287) PubMed Google Scholar ) consortia ( Figure 2 A), we found that the 2q21.3 locus is characterized by enhancer-associated marks in blood, fetal brain, and mesenchymal lineages, including adipocytes and their progenitor cells.

We thus considered the possibility that the positive selection haplotype might be associated with altered chromatin accessibility and expression across the locus ( Flavahan et al., 2016 22. Flavahan, W.A. ∙ Drier, Y. ∙ Liau, B.B. ...

We tested for differences of binding of the chromatin boundary factor CTCF to the haplotype and found that CTCF indeed preferentially binds the derived T allele of rs1438307 ( Figures 2 D and S2 A). Because of the relatively low read depth at the canonical rs4988235, we were unable to test for allelic bias at this particular position, and our findings should only indicate that the haplotype as a whole alters CTCF binding. The T allele further associated with increased expression of R3HDM1 as well as UBXN4 , ZRANB3 , and RAB3GAP1 but not flanking genes outside the positively selected region such as CXCR4 ( Figure 2 D). In addition, we found a substantial allelic bias of rs1438307 for histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3; a histone mark associated with open chromatin and active transcription) across cell types ( Figure S2 C), supporting the notion that increased accessibility was associated with the T allele.
Consistent with our hypothesis that chromatin accessibility and gene expression across the locus is programmed by the genetic architecture, we found that expression of the miR-128-1 host gene R3HDM1 is strongly linked to the expression of the MCM6 gene in 984 cell lines in the GDSC database (GDSC, CellMinerCDB; https://discover.nci.nih.gov/cellminercdb/ ) (r = 0.488, p = 3.44e-60, Figure 2 E), indicative of concerted differential gene regulation at the locus. Furthermore, using expression data from 940 cell lines in the CCLE database (CCLE, CellMinerCDB), we found that miR-128-1 expression also correlated with the expression of the host gene R3HDM1 (r = 0.337, p = 2.05e-26, Figure 2 F). Last, we confirmed that the rs1438307 T allele associates with higher DNase I accessibility compared to the G allele at the miR-128-1 promoter, just upstream of the sequence encoding the miRNA itself ( Figure S2 D). These results link rs1438307 to altered chromatin architecture and accessibility leading to coordinated expression changes across the locus through epigenetic regulation.
To assess whether the miR-128-1 haplotype has an effect on miR-128-1 expression, we conducted an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis in subcutaneous and visceral white adipose tissues (WATs) from 64 derived homozygotes, 76 heterozygotes, and 39 ancestral homozygotes from a European cohort. We found a subtle haplotype-specific differential expression of miR-128-1 (F-test p = 0.06; Figures S3 A and S3B). We observed this trend to be depot specific, with visceral WAT expression being somewhat higher than in subcutaneous WAT in both our discovery and replication cohorts (1.8-fold, p = 1.2e-4 and 1.8-fold, p = 4.7e-3, Figures S3 A and S3B). When evaluating the effect of the haplotype tagging variant rs1446585, there was a trend toward the G allele lowering miR-128-1 expression in three cohorts ( Figure S3 C). We further noted a significant association of miR-128-1 levels with elevated fasting glucose (beta = 0.345, p = 0.0015, Figure S3 D), HbA1c levels (beta = 0.135, p = 0.028, Figure S3 E), and triacylglycerol (TAG)/high-density lipoprotein (HDL) ratio (all associated with the metabolic syndrome; beta = 0.071, p = 0.044, Figure S3 F) in our well-annotated adipose tissue replication cohort (n = 31). Using data from the METSIM study (n = 200, Civelek et al., 2013 15. Civelek, M. ∙ Hagopian, R. ∙ Pan, C. ... Genetic regulation of human adipose microRNA expression and its consequences for metabolic traits Hum. Mol. Genet. 2013; 22 :3023-3037 Crossref Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ), where mature miR-128 expression was measured with high-throughput sequencing, we confirmed the significant association between log-transformed miR-128 expression and serum fasting glucose levels (beta = 0.47, p = 0.01; Figure S3 G). When examining a time course of human adipocyte differentiation, we found that miR-128-1 expression increases steadily throughout differentiation ( Figure S3 H), consistent with a mechanism active in mature adipocytes. Finally, we examined the FINEMAP-derived posterior estimates ( https://www.finucanelab.org/data ) and found an association block next to rs4988235 for which the derived allele of rs1446585 was a strong causal candidate for decreased ApoA1 and HDL-cholesterol levels ( Figure S3 I), but which was not associated with other metabolic traits.
Together, we show that the European long haplotype at 2q21.3 is associated with a locus-wide increased chromatin accessibility, which leads to coordinated elevated expression of miR-128-1 and co-expressed genes at the locus. Given the increased expression of miR-128-1 through differentiation and depot-specific expression, we implicate adipose and possibly other metabolic tissues in this effect. Altogether, our data provide evidence that the 2q21.3 locus associates with metabolic traits.
To explore whether miR-128-1 plays a role in regulating energy expenditure and metabolic control, we initially tested miR-128-1 inhibition by anti-miR oligonucleotides in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed male C57BL/6J mice, an established diet-induced obesity (DIO) model ( Lee et al., 2014 49. Lee, H.Y. ∙ Jeong, K.H. ∙ Choi, C.S., International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium In-depth metabolic phenotyping of genetically engineered mouse models in obesity and diabetes Mamm. Genome. 2014; 25 :508-521 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Treatment with once-weekly subcutaneous injections of 10 mg/kg of a locked nucleic acid (LNA)-modified anti-miR targeting miR-128-1 (miR-128-1 ASO) over 16 weeks in male DIO mice potently reduced miR-128-1 levels in metabolic tissues (e.g., liver; Figure S4 A), which was accompanied by strongly reduced weight gain on the HFD, being apparent already 2 weeks after treatment initiation ( Figures 3 A and 3B). This was not due to decreased food intake; if anything, the mice, at least temporarily, consumed more food in response to anti-miR-128-1 treatment ( Figure S4 B), possibly related to compensatory mechanisms ( Soukas et al., 2000 87. Soukas, A. ∙ Cohen, P. ∙ Socci, N.D. ... Leptin-specific patterns of gene expression in white adipose tissue Genes Dev. 2000; 14 :963-980 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). In agreement with our previous studies in Apoe −/− mice ( Wagschal et al., 2015 98. Wagschal, A. ∙ Najafi-Shoushtari, S.H. ∙ Wang, L. ... Genome-wide identification of microRNAs regulating cholesterol and triglyceride homeostasis Nat. Med. 2015; 21 :1290-1297 Crossref Scopus (176) PubMed Google Scholar ), treatment with anti-miR-128-1 resulted in markedly lowered circulating total cholesterol and TAG levels ( Figures S4 C and S4D). Body composition studies with 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance (EchoMRI) revealed substantially decreased fat stores (>25%; p < 0.05) after 15 weeks of treatment but no significant effect on lean mass ( Figure 3 C). Accordingly, the visceral (epididymal) and subcutaneous (inguinal) fat pads were markedly smaller in anti-miR-128-1-treated animals as compared with control anti-miR-treated mice ( Figure 3 D). Livers of anti-miR-128-1-treated mice also exhibited smaller size and were less pale, indicative of decreased hepatic lipid accumulation as compared to controls ( Figure 3 D). In contrast, the inter-scapular brown adipose tissue (BAT) depot, which plays a key role in thermogenesis and regulation of energy expenditure, exhibited increased brown adipose appearance (less fat accumulation/hypertrophy and increased mitochondrial content) in response to anti-miR-128-1 treatment ( Figure 3 D).
Next, we evaluated the phenotypic effects of anti-miR-128-1 treatment in metabolic tissues (e.g., BAT, WAT, liver, and skeletal muscle). In accordance with the gross appearance of the BAT depot, histological analysis revealed strongly decreased accumulation of fat and markedly increased staining with an antibody recognizing the BAT hallmark, uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp1), in immunohistological analysis of anti-miR-128-1-treated mice as compared with control-treated mice ( Figure 3 E). Evaluation of gene expression changes in BAT revealed that anti-miR-128-1 treatment resulted in an increase in mRNA levels of several predicted and verified direct targets of miR-128-1 ( www.targetscan.org ), including Prdm16 , Ppargc1a , and Ppara , which are known to promote BAT cell-fate determination and stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO) ( Ohno et al., 2013 63.

Invest. 2011; 121 :96-105 Crossref Scopus (760) PubMed Google Scholar ), as well as the expression of a number of mitochondrial and energy expenditure genes such as Dio2 , Cidea , and Cox family members ( Cannon and Nedergaard, 2004 14.

WAT hypertrophy, as well as inflammatory cell infiltration in WAT, are frequently associated with obesity and T2D ( Sun et al., 2011a 90. Sun, K. ∙ Kusminski, C.M. ∙ Scherer, P.E. Adipose tissue remodeling and obesity J. Clin. Invest. 2011; 121 :2094-2101 Crossref Scopus (977) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wensveen et al., 2015 105. Wensveen, F.M. ∙ Valentić, S. ∙ Šestan, M. ... The “Big Bang” in obese fat: Events initiating obesity-induced adipose tissue inflammation Eur. J. Immunol. 2015; 45 :2446-2456 Crossref Scopus (156) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that anti-miR-128-1 treatment of DIO mice led to smaller fat cells and decreased “crown-like” accumulation of macrophages surrounding the fat cells in epididymal WAT ( Figure 3 G), evidence of a positive effect of anti-miR-128-1 treatment on WAT fat storage and inflammation. In agreement, the expression of Pparg and Adipoq (adiponectin), two hallmark genes of healthy fat ( Ohno et al., 2012 62. Ohno, H. ∙ Shinoda, K. ∙ Spiegelman, B.M. ...

Rosen, E.D. ∙ Spiegelman, B.M. What we talk about when we talk about fat Cell. 2014; 156 :20-44 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1022) PubMed Google Scholar ), was increased in epididymal WAT in response to anti-miR-128-1 treatment, whereas genes encoding inflammatory cytokines and macrophage markers such as Tnfa , Il-1b , Il-6 and Mcp1 ( Hotamisligil et al., 1993 34. Hotamisligil, G.S. ∙ Shargill, N.S. ∙ Spiegelman, B.M.

Obesity is associated with macrophage accumulation in adipose tissue J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112 :1796-1808 Crossref Scopus (6581) PubMed Google Scholar ) were downregulated ( Figure 3 H; Figure S4 F).
Metabolic dysfunction associated with obesity and T2D typically also manifests as excess fat accumulation and inflammation in the liver, hallmarks of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and steatohepatitis (NAFLD/NASH) ( Shulman, 2000 83. Shulman, G.I. Cellular mechanisms of insulin resistance J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106 :171-176 Crossref Scopus (2070) PubMed Google Scholar , Suzuki and Diehl, 2017 92. Suzuki, A. ∙ Diehl, A.M. Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Annu. Rev. Med. 2017; 68 :85-98 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that anti-miR-128-1 treatment caused a dramatic decrease in hepatic lipid accumulation and inflammation in DIO mice ( Figure 3 I). The marked reduction in liver fat correlated with strongly decreased levels of the Srebp1 transcription factor, a master regulator of lipogenic gene expression ( Horton et al., 2002 33. Horton, J.D. ∙ Goldstein, J.L. ∙ Brown, M.S. SREBPs: activators of the complete program of cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis in the liver J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109 :1125-1131 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Accordingly, expression of Srebp1 target genes encoding lipid synthesis enzymes ( Acc1 and Fasn ) was coordinately downregulated in response to anti-miR-128-1 treatment ( Figure 3 J; Figure S4 G). We also observed a decrease in the expression of genes linked to adipogenesis and fat storage ( Pparg and Fabp4 ) and increased expression of Ppara , encoding a transcriptional regulator of genes involved in FAO ( Pawlak et al., 2015 64. Pawlak, M. ∙ Lefebvre, P. ∙ Staels, B. Molecular mechanism of PPARα action and its impact on lipid metabolism, inflammation and fibrosis in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease J. Hepatol. 2015; 62 :720-733 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (477) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 3 J).
Skeletal muscle represents another highly metabolically active tissue, and anti-miR-128-1-treated DIO mice also show potent stimulation of genes encoding proteins broadly involved in controlling cellular metabolic circuits, such as Pparα, Pgc-1α, Ampkα2, Ucp3, and many others in this tissue as compared to controls ( Figures 3 K–3M). Taken together, these findings support the notion that miR-128-1 acts to coordinately restrict gene expression programs governing energy expenditure across multiple metabolically active organs and tissues. Accordingly, metabolic cage studies revealed that inhibition of miR-128-1 caused markedly enhanced energy expenditure, without significantly affecting locomotor activity levels ( Figure 3 N; Figures S4 H–S4J). Consistent with miR-128-1 mediating these metabolic effects directly through regulating expression of target genes involved in metabolic control, we found that miR-128-1 negatively regulates expression of luciferase reporters fused with 3′ UTRs of human PPARGC1 , PPARG , PPARA , and PRDM16 , with effects abolished by mutation of conserved miR-128-1 target sites ( Figure S4 K).
Obesity and ectopic fat deposition in liver and skeletal muscle is frequently linked to insulin resistance and poor glucose control and is a major risk factor for the development of T2D ( Shulman, 2000 83. Shulman, G.I. Cellular mechanisms of insulin resistance J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106 :171-176 Crossref Scopus (2070) PubMed Google Scholar , Kahn et al., 2006 38. Kahn, S.E. ∙ Hull, R.L. ∙ Utzschneider, K.M. Mechanisms linking obesity to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes Nature. 2006; 444 :840-846 Crossref Scopus (2835) PubMed Google Scholar ). DIO mice present with hyperglycemia and moderate insulin resistance; these abnormal metabolic traits were significantly ameliorated by anti-miR-128-1 treatment as revealed by glucose and insulin tolerance tests ( Figures 3 O and 3P). To further ascertain the role of miR-128-1 in obesity-associated glucose abnormalities, we carried out hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies ( Kim, 2009 43. Kim, J.K. Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp to assess insulin sensitivity in vivo Methods Mol. Biol. 2009; 560 :221-238 Crossref Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ; Perry et al., 2015 65. Perry, R.J. ∙ Camporez, J.G. ∙ Kursawe, R. ... Hepatic acetyl CoA links adipose tissue inflammation to hepatic insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes Cell. 2015; 160 :745-758 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (334) PubMed Google Scholar ) in DIO mice treated with anti-miR-128-1 and control anti-miR. Accompanying the decreased body weight and lowered fat mass ( Figures 4 A and 4B), anti-miR-128-1-treated mice exhibited marked improvements in insulin-stimulated whole-body glucose metabolism, as revealed by substantially increased glucose infusion rates required to maintain euglycemia during the clamp ( Figures 4 C–4E). This improvement in whole-body insulin-stimulated glucose metabolism could be attributed to marked improvements in muscle glucose uptake as reflected by increased 2-deoxyglucose uptake in skeletal muscle ( Figure 4 F) as well as increased hepatic insulin responsiveness as reflected by greater suppression of hepatic glucose production during the clamp ( Figure 4 G). In addition, anti-miR-128-1 treatment also manifested increased WAT insulin sensitivity as reflected by increased 2-deoxyglucose uptake in WAT ( Figure 4 F) and increased suppression of non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) release from WAT ( Figure 4 H) during the clamp, both of which are hallmarks of T2D and contributors to increased rates of hepatic gluconeogenesis ( Karpe et al., 2011 41.

These results together demonstrate a key role for miR-128-1 in modulating metabolic circuits that govern glucose homeostasis, consistent with the genetic link of the miR-128-1 locus to T2D.
Next, we sought to evaluate whether miR-128-1 might also contribute to metabolic abnormalities in the classic leptin-deficient ob/ob genetic obesity mouse model ( Wang et al., 2014 101. Wang, B. ∙ Chandrasekera, P.C. ∙ Pippin, J.J. Leptin- and leptin receptor-deficient rodent models: relevance for human type 2 diabetes Curr. Diabetes Rev. 2014; 10 :131-145 Crossref Scopus (220) PubMed Google Scholar ). These mice exhibit profound hyperphagia due to the lack of the satiety hormone leptin, which is normally secreted from WAT in response to feeding and acts in the hypothalamus to suppress feeding behavior ( Wang et al., 2014 101. Wang, B. ∙ Chandrasekera, P.C. ∙ Pippin, J.J. Leptin- and leptin receptor-deficient rodent models: relevance for human type 2 diabetes Curr. Diabetes Rev. 2014; 10 :131-145 Crossref Scopus (220) PubMed Google Scholar ). Treatment of ob/ob mice fed a standard chow diet with anti-miR-128-1 resulted in a modest but significant decrease in body weight and overall fat mass and decreased size of liver and visceral (epididymal) WAT depots ( Figures S5 A and S5B). Metabolic cage analysis demonstrated markedly elevated energy expenditure in response to anti-miR-128-1 treatment as compared with control anti-miR treatment ( Figure S5 C). Accordingly, histological and molecular analyses of BAT revealed decreased fat accumulation and strongly increased expression of BAT markers and energy expenditure genes such as Prdm16 , Ppargc1a , Ppara (all direct targets of miR-128-1; Figure S4 K) as well as Ucp1 , Cidea , Dio2 , and Elovl3 ( Figures S5 D and S5E), indicative of improved BAT function. We also observed decreased adipocyte hypertrophy in the subcutaneous (inguinal) WAT depot, accompanied by elevated expression of browning markers and energy expenditure genes (e.g., Prdm16 , Ppargc1a , Ppara , Ucp1 ) in animals treated with anti-miR-128-1, consistent with browning or beigeing of subcutaneous WAT depots ( Kajimura et al., 2015 39. Kajimura, S. ∙ Spiegelman, B.M. ∙ Seale, P. Brown and Beige Fat: Physiological Roles beyond Heat Generation Cell Metab. 2015; 22 :546-559 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (418) PubMed Google Scholar ). Additionally, expression of Srebf1 and lipogenic genes ( Acc1 and Fasn ) was diminished, and expression of inflammatory cytokines ( Tnfα and Il1b ) was lowered ( Figures S5 F and S5G). Anti-miR-128-1 treatment also resulted in improved hepatic steatosis and led to decreased liver expression of markers of inflammation and lipogenesis in ob/ob mice ( Figures S5 H and S5I). These beneficial metabolic effects were accompanied by markedly improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in anti-miR-128-1-treated ob/ob mice ( Figures S5 J and S5K), confirming a potent metabolic regulatory function of miR-128-1 in both diet-induced and genetic obesity and T2D models.
To confirm the role of miR-128-1 in controlling energy expenditure in vivo , we next analyzed the effects of miR-128-1 whole-animal genetic ablation ( Tan et al., 2013 95. Tan, C.L. ∙ Plotkin, J.L. ∙ Venø, M.T. ... MicroRNA-128 governs neuronal excitability and motor behavior in mice Science. 2013; 342 :1254-1258 Crossref Scopus (175) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wark et al., 2017 102. Wark, A.R. ∙ Terman, E.J. ∙ Tabin, C.J. miR-128-1 is not required for hair pigmentation in mice Exp. Dermatol. 2017; 26 :940-942 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) in mice using the DIO model. Most KO animals were viable and fertile, with no obvious developmental, physiological or behavioral phenotypes. Upon challenge with a HFD, the miR-128-1 KO mice exhibited significantly decreased weight gain as compared with wild-type (WT) littermates ( Figure 5 A). After 12 weeks on the HFD, the miR-128-1 KO mice WAT depots were >60% smaller that WT controls, as revealed by EchoMRI ( Figure 5 B). Metabolic cage studies also showed that miR-128-1 KO mice exhibit markedly increased energy expenditure, without apparent effect on activity ( Figures 5 C and 5D). Consistently, the miR-128-1 KO mice were significantly more tolerant to cold exposure as compared with WT littermates ( Figure 5 E). Examination of the inter-scapular BAT depot revealed strongly decreased intracellular fat ( Figure 5 F), and primary BAT cells isolated from miR-128-1 KO mice exhibited greatly increased mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate and energy expenditure, as shown by Seahorse studies ( Figure 5 G), as well as elevated expression of BAT and energy expenditure marker genes such as Prdm16 , Ppargc1a , and Ppargc1b and Ucp1 ( Figure S6 ). Beneficial effects on metabolic gene expression were also observed in WAT, skeletal muscle, and liver of miR-128-1 KO mice ( Figure S6 ). Finally, similar to the results in DIO mice treated with anti-miR-128-1, the HFD-fed miR-128-1 KO mice exhibited markedly improved glucose homeostasis and response to insulin ( Figures 5 H and 5I). These findings strongly support the notion that miR-128-1 represents a crucial regulator of whole-animal metabolism by acting as a “thrifty” miRNA to suppress energy expenditure through apparent effects in multiple metabolic tissues, such as WAT, BAT, liver, and skeletal muscle.
Next, we further investigated the molecular mechanism(s) of miR-128-1 regulation of cellular metabolism and determined whether the regulatory effects observed in metabolic tissues are cell autonomous. Introduction of excess miR-128-1 precursor into human abdominal subcutaneous WAT-derived pre-adipocytes resulted in decreased adipogenesis in response to a differentiation cocktail, with lowered numbers of mature, fat-storing adipocytes, and decreased expression of white adipocyte differentiation markers such as PPARG , CEBPA , FABP4 , PPARGC1A , and PPARA , as well as the adipokines adiponectin ( ADIPOQ ) and leptin ( LEP ) ( Figures 6 A and 6B). Conversely, treatment of pre-adipocytes with anti-miR-128-1 caused increased adipocyte differentiation and elevated expression of genes associated with mature WAT ( Figures 6 C and 6D). In particular, the expression of adiponectin and leptin was markedly affected by changing miR-128-1 levels (both mRNAs are predicted miR-128-1 targets in humans but not in mice; www.targetscan.org ). These adipokines have been shown to represent hallmarks of healthy WAT and exert beneficial metabolic effects in multiple tissues ( Meier and Gressner, 2004 57. Meier, U. ∙ Gressner, A.M. Endocrine regulation of energy metabolism: review of pathobiochemical and clinical chemical aspects of leptin, ghrelin, adiponectin, and resistin Clin. Chem. 2004; 50 :1511-1525 Crossref Scopus (737) PubMed Google Scholar ). In accord with the gene-expression data, we observed potent regulation by miR-128-1 of leptin and adiponectin secreted into the culture medium ( Figures 6 E and 6F). In addition to being targets of miR-128-1, it is likely that leptin and adiponectin are induced indirectly in WAT through the miR-128-1 target and pro-adipogenesis transcription factor PPARγ. We also verified that altering miR-128-1 levels had concordant effects on levels of target proteins, such as AMPKα2, PGC-1α, SIRT1, PPARα, PPARγ, INSR, and IRS1 ( Figure 6 G). In keeping with the known role of AMPKα2 as a key stress kinase regulator of the lipogenic enzyme ACC1 by direct inhibitory phosphorylation, altered AMPKα2 levels in response to miR-128-1 manipulations resulted in corresponding changes in ACC1 phosphorylation status ( Figure 6 G). A number of miR-128-1 targets (e.g., AMPKα2, PGC-1α, SIRT1, PPARα) regulate FAO, and we found that miR-128-1 overexpression decreased, whereas miR-128-1 inhibition increased, FAO in human WAT-derived adipocytes ( Figures 6 H and 6I). These findings are consistent with in vivo data from WAT in DIO mice, where anti-miR-128-1 treatment results in decreased WAT hypertrophy, accompanied by lowered expression of Srebf1 and lipogenic target genes ( Figures S7 A–S7D), as well as significant de-repression of Pparg , Adipoq , and Ppargc1a , and elevated expression of Prdm16 , Ppara , and Ucp1 ( Figures S7 E–S7J), suggesting increased browning of WAT in response to inhibition of miR-128-1 in DIO mice.
Due to the marked positive effects on BAT differentiation and energy expenditure observed in DIO and ob/ob mice treated with anti-miR-128-1 and in the HFD-fed miR-128-1 KO mice, we evaluated the molecular mechanism and functional importance of miR-128-1 in regulating brown adipose cell differentiation in vitro . Primary brown pre-adipocytes isolated from the inter-scapular BAT depot of Day 1 newborn miR-128-1 WT and KO mice were induced to differentiate and then stained with oil red O as a marker of mature adipocyte differentiation. We found that loss of miR-128-1 resulted in strongly increased capacity to differentiate into mature brown adipocytes ( Figure 7 A). This was supported by results from Seahorse analysis showing elevated energy expenditure in brown adipocytes from miR-128-1-null mice ( Figure 7 B). Moreover, expression of brown adipose hallmark genes ( Prdm16 , Ucp1 ) as well as transcription factors and co-activators involved in adipose cell fate determination and regulation of gene expression programs governing lipid homeostasis and energy expenditure ( Pparg , Ppara , and Ppargc1a ) was elevated in differentiated brown adipocytes from miR-128-1 KO mice as compared with controls ( Figures 7 C–7G). We also examined acute effects of introducing pre-miR-128-1 in already differentiated WT brown adipocytes, in the presence or absence of the brown adipose inducer dbcAMP ( Uldry et al., 2006 97. Uldry, M. ∙ Yang, W. ∙ St-Pierre, J. ... Complementary action of the PGC-1 coactivators in mitochondrial biogenesis and brown fat differentiation Cell Metab. 2006; 3 :333-341 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (429) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our studies revealed potent suppression of direct (e.g., Prdm16 , Ppargc1a , Ppara ) and indirect (e.g., Ucp1 and Cidea ) miR-128-1 targets involved in brown adipocyte function and lipid homeostasis and energy expenditure programs, even in the presence of dbcAMP ( Figures 7 H–7J). Moreover, introduction of anti-miR-128-1 into mature, differentiated mouse brown adipocytes resulted in marked de-repression of the expression of these genes ( Figures 7 K–7M). Cell-lineage-tracing studies in vivo have revealed that brown adipocytes can derive from a Myf5 -positive skeletal muscle precursor lineage ( Sanchez-Gurmaches and Guertin, 2014 76. Sanchez-Gurmaches, J. ∙ Guertin, D.A. Adipocyte lineages: tracing back the origins of fat Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2014; 1842 :340-351 Crossref Scopus (136) PubMed Google Scholar ; Seale et al., 2008 79. Seale, P. ∙ Bjork, B. ∙ Yang, W. ... PRDM16 controls a brown fat/skeletal muscle switch Nature. 2008; 454 :961-967 Crossref Scopus (1447) PubMed Google Scholar ). In vitro studies have also shown that the mouse C2C12 muscle precursor cell line can be differentiated into brown adipocytes ( Sun et al., 2011b 91. Sun, L. ∙ Xie, H. ∙ Mori, M.A. ... Mir193b-365 is essential for brown fat differentiation Nat. Cell Biol. 2011; 13 :958-965 Crossref Scopus (213) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that anti-miR-128-1 treatment of C2C12 cells markedly promoted brown lineage commitment and differentiation into mature brown adipocytes, as judged by elevated oil red O staining and increased expression of pan-adipocyte ( Pparg , aP2 , Cebpa , Adipoq ) and brown adipose marker genes ( Prdm16 , Ucp1 , Cidea , Elovl3 , Ppargc1a , Ppara ) but decreased expression of mature myocyte genes ( Figures 7 N–7R). In accord, induction of brown adipocyte differentiation of C2C12 cells in response to inhibition of miR-128-1 was accompanied by elevated FAO and increased energy expenditure, functional hallmarks of mature brown adipocytes ( Figures 7 S and 7T). Taken together, these findings provide strong support for a direct cell-autonomous role of miR-128-1 in suppressing brown adipocyte cell fate and function (energy expenditure).

Section: Discussion

Positive selection of a long (∼1 Mb) haplotype on human chromosome 2 in Europeans, harboring the lactase ( LCT ) gene, has been thought to be solely due to LP, allowing adult milk consumption. The ability to consume fresh milk beyond infancy may indeed have provided a selective advantage in ancient populations faced with poor nutrition and famine. However, this hypothesis may not fully account for the remarkably strong positive selection signature resulting in the long haplotype in this genomic locus. For example, studies of ancient DNA and extensive archeological records have shown that herders consumed milk products for thousands of years before the emergence of the LP haplotype/phenotype around 4KY ago ( Jeong et al., 2018 36. Jeong, C. ∙ Wilkin, S. ∙ Amgalantugs, T. ... Bronze Age population dynamics and the rise of dairy pastoralism on the eastern Eurasian steppe Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115 :E11248-E11255 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar , Mathieson et al., 2015 54. Mathieson, I. ∙ Lazaridis, I. ∙ Rohland, N. ... Genome-wide patterns of selection in 230 ancient Eurasians Nature. 2015; 528 :499-503 Crossref Scopus (506) PubMed Google Scholar ), challenging the importance of fresh milk consumption as a potential driver of evolutionary adaptation to famine. Importantly, the European long haplotype is also associated with metabolic disorders such as obesity and T2D. It has been difficult, however, to reconcile LP with these metabolic abnormalities, and, based on our data presented here, we propose that the miR-128-1 miRNA located in the center of the positively selected locus might contribute to some of these links. Indeed, our results showing concordance of the positive selection haplotype with genetic associations of the miR-128-1 locus to obesity and T2D, as well as the phenome-wide association study using UK Biobank data revealing association of 2q21.3 variants with diverse body-fat-related traits might be consistent with metabolic regulation by miR-128-1. However, it does not rule out the possibility that some of the signal is due to LCT in humans. Self-reported fresh milk intake, depending on milk fat content, however, has a complex relationship with body-fat phenotypes in the UK Biobank dataset and will require further in-depth study.
In support of the links of the locus to metabolic phenotypes, we highlight data suggesting that the syntenic genomic region near R3HDM1 /miR-128-1 in cattle has been under positive selection and is associated with feed efficiency and intramuscular fat, thrifty metabolic traits selected for in certain cattle breeds ( Barendse et al., 2009 7. Barendse, W. ∙ Harrison, B.E. ∙ Bunch, R.J. ... Genome wide signatures of positive selection: the comparison of independent samples and the identification of regions associated to traits BMC Genomics. 2009; 10 :178 Crossref Scopus (72) PubMed Google Scholar ; Gibbs et al., 2009 25. Gibbs, R.A. ∙ Taylor, J.F. ∙ Van Tassell, C.P. ..., Bovine HapMap Consortium Genome-wide survey of SNP variation uncovers the genetic structure of cattle breeds Science. 2009; 324 :528-532 Crossref Scopus (569) PubMed Google Scholar ; Mei et al., 2018 56. Mei, C. ∙ Wang, H. ∙ Liao, Q. ... Genetic Architecture and Selection of Chinese Cattle Revealed by Whole Genome Resequencing Mol. Biol. Evol. 2018; 35 :688-699 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, dog breeds exhibiting a “bulky” (large size/excess backfat) phenotype have characteristic SNPs in the promoter of the miR-128-1 host gene R3HDM1 ( Plassais et al., 2019 67. Plassais, J. ∙ Kim, J. ∙ Davis, B.W. ... Whole genome sequencing of canids reveals genomic regions under selection and variants influencing morphology Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :1489 Crossref Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cattle and canines are weaned and do not consume fresh milk in adulthood. While these finding may be consistent with our data showing that miR-128-1 regulates metabolic circuits and promotes fat storage in mammals, further studies will be needed to assess whether miR-128-1 contributes to the genetically selected phenotypes in cattle and dogs.
Our mechanistic analyses reveal that the European long 2q21.3 haplotype is associated with increased chromatin accessibility and elevated transcriptional activity throughout the locus, likely in part due to altered CTCF chromatin boundary factor occupancy, contributing to the changes in miR-128-1/gene expression across the locus. Although the derived allele of the rs4988235 SNP present in the MCM6 intronic enhancer is strongly correlated with increased expression of the nearby LCT gene, it is possible the activity from this enhancer, in the context of the overall chromatin architecture of the European long haplotype, is also linked to the expression of other genes in the locus, as well as miR-128-1. Future studies are needed to address this and determine which variants and targets drive the associations.
Intervention studies with anti-miR treatment targeting miR-128-1 in mouse obesity models suggest that miR-128-1 represents a crucial regulator of metabolism by suppressing the expression of a number of genes encoding critical metabolic regulators in multiple metabolic tissues. Indeed, antagonism or ablation of miR-128-1 either by antisense targeting or whole-animal KO results in markedly increased energy expenditure, accompanied by reduced fat mass and improved whole-body glucose metabolism, which could be attributed to increased liver, muscle, and adipose tissue insulin sensitivity. Based on these observations, along with human GWAS data, we propose that elevated levels of miR-128-1 in metabolic tissues may reduce energy expenditure and promote increased fat storage in humans as well.
Taken together, our data showing a key role for miR-128-1 in programming a metabolic switch from energy expenditure to energy storage and the links of the miR-128-1 genomic locus to positive selection and abnormal metabolism complement the role of LP at the locus. Indeed, altered expression of miR-128-1 could have been beneficial in ancient times but, presently, with persistent calorie abundance, may constitute a metabolic maladaptation, predisposing to obesity and T2D. Hence, miR-128-1 may represent a therapeutic target for the treatment of metabolic diseases such as obesity and T2D.
There are many limitations to this work. Comprehensive measures of selection and GWASs are not available for most species, and fewer still have well-powered GWASs of metabolic traits. This limits our ability to evaluate the presence of, and associations with, selection at the 2q21.3 locus. In addition, the long European haplotype contains numerous variants, and determining which are causal for the observed associations is an area of future study. Direct perturbation will also enable more comprehensive characterization of the epigenetic and transcriptomic consequences of these variants, which should help determine the gene(s) and/or miRNA(s) attributable to the various observed phenotypes associated with the locus and disentangle population history, environmental correlates, and single-variant effects. Furthermore, because miR-128-1 regulates the expression of many metabolic genes coordinately in multiple metabolically active tissues, it presents a formidable challenge to fully elucidate the mechanistic links of miR-128-1 to specific targets and in specific tissues. Finally, mouse models are an important step in understanding the mechanistic basis of miR-128-1 metabolic control; however, clinical studies will be critical to applying this knowledge to human disease alleviation.

The C57BL/6J and ob/ob mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, all were male aged at 6-8 weeks.
miR-128-1 KO mice: experimental manipulation of miR-128-1 in vivo was achieved by crossing mice carrying miR-128-1 floxed alleles ( Tan et al., 2013 95. Tan, C.L. ∙ Plotkin, J.L. ∙ Venø, M.T. ... MicroRNA-128 governs neuronal excitability and motor behavior in mice Science. 2013; 342 :1254-1258 Crossref Scopus (175) PubMed Google Scholar ) to transgenic Cre-recombinase mouse lines. For germline excision, we used the ubiquitously expressed cytomegalovirus-Cre mouse line (CMV-Cre; Jackson Labs #006054). Genotyping was performed as described in Wark et al., (2017) 102. Wark, A.R. ∙ Terman, E.J. ∙ Tabin, C.J. miR-128-1 is not required for hair pigmentation in mice Exp. Dermatol. 2017; 26 :940-942 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar . Lines were maintained on the C57BL/6J background on a 12-hour light-dark cycle with constant access to food and water. Male mice with age from 6 weeks to 16 weeks were used in different experiments. All experimental procedures were conducted in accordance with IACUC regulations and were approved by Massachusetts General Hospital’s or Yale University School of Medicine’s IACUC.
LNA–modified anti-miR oligonucleotides targeting miR-128-1 (5′-TTCACTGTG-3′a; 9-mer), (5′-GGTTCACTGTG-3′a; 11-mer) and a scrambled control LNA oligonucleotide (5′-TCATACTA-3′) were purchased from Exiqon, Denmark (now QIAGEN). The 9-mer LNA ASO was used in all in vivo studies except in the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic studies at Yale University School of Medicine, where we used the second-generation 11-mer LNA ASO. Experiments were performed using 7-week-old male C57BL/6J mice or ob/ob mice purchased from The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME. The diet-induced obese (DIO) mice were fed a diet containing 60% (kcal) fat (D12492, Research Diets) for 6 weeks before and during treatment. The longitudinal studies were performed in mice fed with the high-fat diet for 16 weeks, or chow-fed ob/ob mice, with once-weekly subcutaneous injection of the anti-miR-128-1 (10 mg/kg) or control scrambled LNA oligonucleotide. Body weight was measured every week. During the treatment, glucose and insulin tolerance tests are performed at around week 10 and body composition was measured at 14 weeks. Metabolic activity of the mice was analyzed in metabolic cages at around week 15 and data were collected for one week. Upon sacrifice, brown and white (inguinal and epididymal, respectively) adipose tissue and livers were collected and ∼1 mL of blood was obtained from each mouse by right ventricular puncture. Blood was centrifuged at 8,000 rpm for 5 min to obtain serum, which was frozen at −80°C. Total serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels were determined with a Heska Dri-Chem 4000 Chemistry Analyzer (Heska, Loveland, CO) at Massachusetts General Hospital, Center for Comparative Medicine, Diagnostic Laboratory. FPLC analysis of pooled serum was carried out as described ( Wagschal et al., 2015 98. Wagschal, A. ∙ Najafi-Shoushtari, S.H. ∙ Wang, L. ... Genome-wide identification of microRNAs regulating cholesterol and triglyceride homeostasis Nat. Med. 2015; 21 :1290-1297 Crossref Scopus (176) PubMed Google Scholar ), the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated using the linear trapezoidal method based on a linear interpolation between data points. The AUC was calculated as follows: AUC = 1/2 (C1+C2), where C indicates the concentration of lipids in two incremental FPLC fractions. The average AUC value for the VLDL, LDL or HDL fractions was calculated and indicated with the SEM and P value . All mouse procedures were approved by the Massachusetts General Hospital or Yale University School of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees.
All tissue samples were rapidly dissected, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C until mRNA and protein extraction. Western blotting was performed using standard protocol ( Wagschal et al., 2015 98. Wagschal, A. ∙ Najafi-Shoushtari, S.H. ∙ Wang, L. ... Genome-wide identification of microRNAs regulating cholesterol and triglyceride homeostasis Nat. Med. 2015; 21 :1290-1297 Crossref Scopus (176) PubMed Google Scholar ), briefly, cells or tissues were lysed in RIPA buffer (0.5% NP-40, 0.1% SDS, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)). Proteins were separated by SDS–PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore) and probed with antibodies of the respective targets. For mRNA and miRNA quantification, TRIzol (Life Technologies/Invitrogen) was used for total RNA and miRNA extraction from either mouse tissues or cells. For miRNA extraction from human tissues mirVana miRNA Isolation Kit, with phenol (ThermoFisher Scientific Cat# AM1560) was used. The high Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit and the TaqMan MicroRNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Life Technologies/Invitrogen) were used for further reverse transcription. cDNA was further evaluated by real-time PCR for gene expression using Power SYBR Green or Taqman PCR Master Mix with ABI 7500 Real-Time PCR System The amount of the indicated mRNA or miRNA was normalized to the amount of 18S and U6 RNA, respectively. Total RNA for miRNA expression levels analysis in human tissues was purchased from Ambion (FirstChoice Human Total RNA Survey Panel, AM6000). To quantify miR-128-1 levels, RNAs were reverse transcribed using the TaqMan MicroRNA Reverse Transcription Kit and quantified with the miRNA-specific TaqMan miRNA assays (Life Technologies/Invitrogen). PCR primer sequences are available from A.M.N. upon request.
Adipose and liver tissues from each study animal were sectioned for histology ( Lillie and Fulmer, 1976 50. Lillie, R.D. ∙ Fulmer, H.M. Histopathologic Technique and Practical Histochemistry McGraw-Hill, 1976 559-610 Google Scholar ). Paraffin-embedded sections were prepared for H&E and IHC, respectively and the samples were processed in the histology core facility of MGH. The completed slides were examined and representative pictures were taken.
After 15-16 weeks of treatment, mice were individually housed and maintained under otherwise standard housing conditions (12-hour light-dark cycle). The 240 LabMaster System (TSE Systems, Chesterfield, MO) was used to measure the calorimetry indirectly. Mice were provided ad libitum access to food and water with a 4-day acclimation period. Oxygen consumption, energy expenditure, activity (X-y axis movement activity and Z axis 245 rearing activity), as well as food/ water consumption were monitored in consecutive light-dark cycles over 6 successive days.
Male mice underwent surgery under general isoflurane anesthesia to implant a polyethylene catheter in the right jugular vein. After a one-week recovery period, mice were fasted overnight (14 hr) and underwent a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp as previously described ( Jurczak et al., 2012 37. Jurczak, M.J. ∙ Lee, A.H. ∙ Jornayvaz, F.R. ... Dissociation of inositol-requiring enzyme (IRE1α)-mediated c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation from hepatic insulin resistance in conditional X-box-binding protein-1 (XBP1) knock-out mice J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287 :2558-2567 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, mice received a basal infusion of [3- 3 H] glucose (0.05 μCi/min) for 120 min, after which blood samples were taken from the tail vein, centrifuged, and plasma stored at −80°C for further analysis. A 140 min hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp was then initiated: mice were infused with insulin (3.0 mU/[kg-min]) and [3- 3 H] glucose (0.1 μCi/min). Blood samples were obtained from the tip of the tail at 0, 25, 45, 65, 80, 90, 110, 120, 130, and 140 min for plasma glucose measurements. To evaluate insulin-stimulated tissue-specific glucose uptake, a 10 μCi bolus of 2-deoxy-d-[1- 14 C] glucose (PerkinElmer) was injected after 85 minutes. After IV pentobarbital euthanasia, skeletal muscle (gastrocnemius + soleus) and epididymal white adipose tissue were isolated, and tissue [ 14 C] 2-deoxyglucose specific activity was measured.
Plasma glucose concentrations were measured using the YSI Glucose Analyzer, and NEFA using an enzymatic assay (Wako Diagnostics HR Series NEFA-HR(2)). Plasma insulin was measured by radioimmunoassay by the Yale Diabetes Research Center. Basal and clamp endogenous glucose turnover were calculated by measurement of steady-state plasma [ 3 H] glucose enrichment at the end of the basal and clamp periods. Tissue 2-deoxyglucose uptake was calculated following measurement of plasma and tissue [ 14 C] 2-deoxyglucose specific activity as previously reported ( Youn and Buchanan, 1993 107. Youn, J.H. ∙ Buchanan, T.A. Fasting does not impair insulin-stimulated glucose uptake but alters intracellular glucose metabolism in conscious rats Diabetes. 1993; 42 :757-763 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ).
Brown and white pre-adipocytes and C2C12 cells were plated in gelatin-coated XF24-well cell culture microplates (Seahorse Bioscience) and brown and white pre-adipocytes were then differentiated into adipocytes. Oxygen consumption and mitochondrial function were measured by XF24 Extracellular Flux Analyzer (Seahorse Biosciences) as described previously ( Ahfeldt et al., 2012 1. Ahfeldt, T. ∙ Schinzel, R.T. ∙ Lee, Y.K. ... Programming human pluripotent stem cells into white and brown adipocytes Nat. Cell Biol. 2012; 14 :209-219 Crossref Scopus (148) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Mice were fasted for 12 hours before the tests. For glucose tolerance test, 1.5 mg/g D-(+)-glucose (G7528, Sigma Aldrich) was injected intra-peritoneally into the mice and the glucose levels were measured at 0 (before injection), 30, 60, and 120 min post-injection. For insulin tolerance test (ITT), 0.00075 U/g insulin (I9278-5 ML, Sigma Aldrich) was used for intra-peritoneal injection and the glucose levels were measured at 0 (before injection), 15, 45 and 60 min after injection.
Brown and white pre-adipocytes were differentiated and Oil-red O-stained as described ( Wang et al., 2010 100. Wang, L. ∙ Jin, Q. ∙ Lee, J.E. ... Histone H3K27 methyltransferase Ezh2 represses Wnt genes to facilitate adipogenesis Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107 :7317-7322 Crossref Scopus (181) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, cells were plated at a density of 5 × 105 per 10-cm dish in differentiation medium (DMEM plus 10% FBS, 0.1 μM insulin, and 1 nM T3) 4 days before induction of adipogenesis. At day 0, cells were fully confluent and were treated with differentiation medium supplemented with 0.5 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methyl-xanthine (IBMX), 2 μg/mL dexamethasone, and 0.125 mM indomethacin. Two days later, cells were changed to the differentiation medium. The medium was replenished at 2-day intervals. At day 3–4, small lipid droplets appeared in differentiating cells. At day 6–8 postinduction, fully differentiated cells were either stained with Oil Red O or subjected to gene expression analysis by qRT-PCR or western blot. Myocyte differentiation and staining were conducted as described ( Sun et al., 2011b 91. Sun, L. ∙ Xie, H. ∙ Mori, M.A. ... Mir193b-365 is essential for brown fat differentiation Nat. Cell Biol. 2011; 13 :958-965 Crossref Scopus (213) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, to induce myoblasts for adipogenesis, C2C12 myoblasts or primary human myoblasts were infected as described below, cultured to confluence, and then exposed to brown adipocyte differentiation conditions: 10%FBS DMEM, Insulin 850 nM (Sigma), Dexamethasone 0.5 μM (Sigma), IBMX 250 μM (Sigma), Rosiglitazone 1uM (Cayman Chemical), T3 1 nM (Sigma), and Indomethacin 125 nM (Sigma). After 2 days, cells were incubated in culture medium containing insulin 160nM and Rosiglitazone 1 μM for another 2 days, and then were switched to 10% FBS DMEM. To stimulate thermogenesis, cells were incubated with dibutyryl cAMP at 0.5 mM (Sigma) for 4 h.

Luciferase assays were performed in quadruplicate starting from four biological replicates, and error bars represent the SD qRT-PCR analyses were carried out in triplicate or duplicate sets and the error bars represents the SD. The number and age of animals used in each mouse study follows the pertinent literature of comparable studies in which the desired effect sizes were considered to be significant, and details could be found in each individual figure legend. There were no mice excluded in the analyses. Error bars in mouse studies indicate SEM. For both in vitro and in vivo studies, the unpaired two-sided Student’s t test was used for statistical differences. p ≤ 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Data analysis was performed using Excel Software Version 14.4.5.
For Figure S1 B in which summary statistics were reported, SNPs were merged by rsid with HapMap3 SNPs, filtered for strand ambiguity and alleles being different than in HapMap3, and tested for genomic position and p value. All reported SNPs within the window were included in the locuszoom plot. Total cholesterol and LDL were downloaded from the GLGC website ( http://lipidgenetics.org/ ); 1,5-Anhydroglucitol from the metabolomics server ( http://mips.helmholtz-muenchen.de/proj/GWAS/gwas/ ); and singleton density score from the Pritchard lab website ( http://web.stanford.edu/group/pritchardlab/home.html ). Plots were generated in R using ggplot2.
The UK Biobank-wide PheWAS plot was downloaded from the Oxford BIG Server ( http://big.stats.ox.ac.uk/ , Elliot et al. 2018 = https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30305740/ ). For this analysis, the PheWAS for rs1438307 was directly queried, and the resulting associations were filtered to name relevant traits in the figure.
The ancient DNA analysis with estimated allele frequency trajectories and selection coefficients in ifferent ancient European populations was carried out as described ( Mathieson and Mathieson, 2018 53. Mathieson, S. ∙ Mathieson, I. FADS1 and the Timing of Human Adaptation to Agriculture Mol. Biol. Evol. 2018; 35 :2957-2970 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Individuals from our cohorts were compared based on genotype at rs1446585 (the SNP which was present in all datasets). A linear model of the form mir128_Ct ∼control_RNA_Ct + age + sex + batch + Tissue + sex ∗ Tissue + ageˆ2 was set up in R to correct for common confounders in these regressions, to which a term for genotype dosage was added. An ANOVA F-test was used to evaluate significance (p = 0.06). Inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis was used for combining individual dosage test statistics across cohorts.
Data from the 127 reference epigenomes was visualized using the WashU epigenome browser focused on the region, together with CTCF in a few cell types. Both Hi-C and Hi-ChIP data, normalized by the browser, were reported as annotated in the WashU browser.
The chromosome 2 VCF was downloaded from the gnomAD website ( https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/ ) and reported allele frequency was folded (AF = min(AF, 1-AF)) and subset to either African or non-Finnish European as designated by gnomAD ( Karczewski et al., 2020 40. Karczewski, K.J. ∙ Francioli, L.C. ∙ Tiao, G. ..., Genome Aggregation Database Consortium The mutational constraint spectrum quantified from variation in 141,456 humans Nature. 2020; 581 :434-443 Crossref Scopus (604) PubMed Google Scholar ), then plotted using R and ggplot2.
Matched expression data for cell lines in GDSC and CCLE were downloaded from CellMinerCDB ( https://discover.nci.nih.gov/cellminercdb/ ) and plotted using R and ggplot2.
FANTOM time course miRNA data were downloaded from the FANTOM website ( https://fantom.gsc.riken.jp/5 ) and promoters were assigned to genes based on the calls from the miRNA paper ( de Rie et al., 2017 19. de Rie, D. ∙ Abugessaisa, I. ∙ Alam, T. ..., FANTOM Consortium An integrated expression atlas of miRNAs and their promoters in human and mouse Nat. Biotechnol. 2017; 35 :872-878 Crossref Scopus (168) PubMed Google Scholar ). Expression was plotted over time using ggplot2 in R, with error ribbons as 95% confidence intervals using the loess model.
The METSIM calls did not distinguish between miR-128-1 and miR-128-2, as only mature miRNA sequences were used. To overcome this, we downloaded the raw METSIM miRNA-seq data from SRA (linked from GEO GSE45159 , Civelek et al., 2013 15. Civelek, M. ∙ Hagopian, R. ∙ Pan, C. ... Genetic regulation of human adipose microRNA expression and its consequences for metabolic traits Hum. Mol. Genet. 2013; 22 :3023-3037 Crossref Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ), took miRNA hairpin sequences from the miRBase ( http://www.mirbase.org/ ) and aligned to the human orthologs and quantified using Kallisto ( Bray et al., 2016 12. Bray, N.L. ∙ Pimentel, H. ∙ Melsted, P. ... Near-optimal probabilistic RNA-seq quantification Nat. Biotechnol. 2016; 34 :525-527 Crossref Scopus (2040) PubMed Google Scholar ). We filtered out any samples with fewer than 500,000 total mapped reads. Clinical data were downloaded from individual GEO pages and used to compare fasting glucose levels to the measured expression with R.
Raw BAMs from the CATO project ( Maurano et al., 2015 55. Maurano, M.T. ∙ Haugen, E. ∙ Sandstrom, R. ... Large-scale identification of sequence variants influencing human transcription factor occupancy in vivo Nat. Genet. 2015; 47 :1393-1401 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar : https://resources.altius.org/publications/CATO/ ) were downloaded and filtered to those with at least 10 reads covering the rs1438307 variant. Lines with 1 or 2 reference or alternative alleles were excluded due to the potential for miscalling. Each line’s position was calculated based on the total reference + alternative read count versus their log 2 ratio. Thus, the non-reference, non-alternative reads were ignored, as was the read quality (beyond that which was performed in Maurano et al., 2015 55. Maurano, M.T. ∙ Haugen, E. ∙ Sandstrom, R. ... Large-scale identification of sequence variants influencing human transcription factor occupancy in vivo Nat. Genet. 2015; 47 :1393-1401 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). The processed genotype calls were then aggregated by genotype, scaled on a per-line basis by the total read depth in the filtered BAM file. Then each call was scaled by the number of lines with the given genotype to avoid scale differences due to the number of datasets included. Data were output as a bigWig track to the WashU browser after being converted using deeptools at 25 bp resolution.
