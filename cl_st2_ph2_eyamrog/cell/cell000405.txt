Title: Interconnecting solvent quality, transcription, and chromosome folding in Escherichia coli


Abstract: Summary

All cells fold their genomes, including bacterial cells, where the chromosome is compacted into a domain-organized meshwork called the nucleoid. How compaction and domain organization arise is not fully understood. Here, we describe a method to estimate the average mesh size of the nucleoid in Escherichia coli . Using nucleoid mesh size and DNA concentration estimates, we find that the cytoplasm behaves as a poor solvent for the chromosome when the cell is considered as a simple semidilute polymer solution. Monte Carlo simulations suggest that a poor solvent leads to chromosome compaction and DNA density heterogeneity (i.e., domain formation) at physiological DNA concentration. Fluorescence microscopy reveals that the heterogeneous DNA density negatively correlates with ribosome density within the nucleoid, consistent with cryoelectron tomography data. Drug experiments, together with past observations, suggest the hypothesis that RNAs contribute to the poor solvent effects, connecting chromosome compaction and domain formation to transcription and intracellular organization.

Section: Introduction

All cells, regardless of their origin, must package and organize their genome in a small volume. Proper folding of the chromosomes is critical, as it affects many cellular processes, including gene expression, DNA repair, and chromosome segregation. Unlike eukaryotic cells, bacterial cells lack a nuclear membrane and do not package their chromosomal DNA into repeating structural units akin to nucleosomes. However, they still fold and concentrate their chromosomal material into a dynamic and organized DNA meshwork known as the nucleoid. In many bacterial species, including Escherichia coli , the nucleoid is found within a portion of the cytoplasmic space ( Figure 1 A) ( Gray et al., 2019 49. Gray, W.T. ∙ Govers, S.K. ∙ Xiang, Y. ...

Rev. 1994; 58 :211-232 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). This indicates that the compaction of the bacterial chromosome is not simply dictated by the physical confinement created by the cell envelope. Furthermore, the chromosome displays higher-order organization across multiple length scales ( Dame et al., 2019 36. Dame, R.T. ∙ Rashid, F.M. ∙ Grainger, D.C.

For instance, high-resolution chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) studies have demonstrated that the bacterial chromosome is organized into various chromosomal interaction domains (CIDs) within which nearby gene loci interact more frequently with each other than with those outside the domain ( Le et al., 2013 74.

Apart from its compacted and organized structure, another important, though less appreciated, aspect of the nucleoid is its mesh size ( Figure 1 A), as it impacts the mobility of cytoplasmic components and thereby their intracellular organization. For example, the enrichment of ribosomes at the cell poles and between segregated nucleoids in E. coli and other bacteria is often attributed to nucleoid exclusion due to their large sizes ( Azam et al., 2000 5.

USA. 2014; 111 :11413-11418 Crossref Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is, however, difficult to predict which cytoplasmic components are impacted by the nucleoid, as its average mesh size is unknown.
What are the biophysical principles that help explain the compacted size, domain organization, and mesh size of the bacterial nucleoid? Multiple factors are thought to be at play ( Stavans and Oppenheim, 2006 135. Stavans, J. ∙ Oppenheim, A. DNA-protein interactions and bacterial chromosome architecture Phys. Biol. 2006; 3 :R1-R10 Crossref Scopus (72) PubMed Google Scholar ; Surovtsev and Jacobs-Wagner, 2018 138. Surovtsev, I.V. ∙ Jacobs-Wagner, C.

They include biochemical processes that modulate DNA supercoiling ( Dorman, 2019 44. Dorman, C.J. DNA supercoiling and transcription in bacteria: a two-way street BMC Mol. Cell Biol. 2019; 20 :26 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ma and Wang, 2016 85. Ma, J. ∙ Wang, M.D. DNA supercoiling during transcription Biophys. Rev. 2016; 8 :75-87 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ). Bacteria also carry a number of DNA-binding proteins, known as nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs) and structural maintenance of chromosome (SMC) proteins, that alter the structure of the DNA locally or over long molecular distances ( Dame et al., 2019 36. Dame, R.T. ∙ Rashid, F.M. ∙ Grainger, D.C. Chromosome organization in bacteria: mechanistic insights into genome structure and function Nat. Rev.

Microbiol. 2010; 8 :185-195 Crossref Scopus (524) PubMed Google Scholar ). While the direct contribution of these proteins to DNA compaction is not entirely clear ( Spurio et al., 1992 134. Spurio, R. ∙ Dürrenberger, M. ∙ Falconi, M. ... Lethal overproduction of the Escherichia coli nucleoid protein H-NS: ultramicroscopic and molecular autopsy Mol. Gen.

Cell Boundary Confinement Sets the Size and Position of the E. coli Chromosome Curr. Biol. 2019; 29 :2131-2144.e4 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ), NAPs and SMC protein complexes are known to play important roles in the organization and regulation of chromosome architecture at the level of individual genes and CIDs ( Dame et al., 2019 36. Dame, R.T. ∙ Rashid, F.M. ∙ Grainger, D.C. Chromosome organization in bacteria: mechanistic insights into genome structure and function Nat. Rev. Genet. 2019; PubMed Google Scholar ). Other factors have been proposed to affect nucleoid size in an opposing fashion. Transertion, which is the coupling between transcription, translation, and insertion of nascent proteins into the cytoplasmic membrane, is thought to provide an expanding force on the nucleoid ( Bakshi et al., 2014 7. Bakshi, S. ∙ Choi, H. ∙ Mondal, J. ... Time-dependent effects of transcription- and translation-halting drugs on the spatial distributions of the Escherichia coli chromosome and ribosomes Mol.

Structure and partitioning of bacterial DNA: determined by a balance of compaction and expansion forces? FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 131 :235-242 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Conversely, macromolecular crowding is frequently proposed to generate a compacting force through steric (size-dependent) effects ( Bakshi et al., 2014 7. Bakshi, S. ∙ Choi, H. ∙ Mondal, J. ...

Macromolecular crowding: biochemical, biophysical, and physiological consequences Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1993; 22 :27-65 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). The idea is that entropic forces drive depletion of crowders (e.g., proteins and ribosomes) from the nucleoid to reduce the excluded volume. The imbalance in crowder concentration between the nucleoid region and the rest of the cytoplasm results in an effective osmotic pressure that pushes DNA segments closer to each other. The magnitude of the entropic (depletion) forces, which remains to be determined inside cells, will depend on the abundance, size, and polydispersity of the crowders ( Kim et al., 2015 68. Kim, J. ∙ Jeon, C. ∙ Jeong, H. ...

Microbiol. 2020; 113 :1022-1037 Crossref Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ). While steric interactions are primarily emphasized in current models of chromosome compaction, DNA and other cytoplasmic components are not chemically inert, and non-steric interactions may also contribute to chromosome folding in vivo ( Joyeux, 2015 62. Joyeux, M. Compaction of bacterial genomic DNA: clarifying the concepts J. Phys. Condens. Matter. 2015; 27 :383001 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ).
In this study, we adopt a simple polymer physics perspective of the cell by considering the cytoplasm as a polymer solution in which the polymer is the DNA and the solvent is everything else in the cytoplasm (e.g., water, metabolites, proteins, NAPs, ribosomes, and RNAs) ( Figure 1 A). That is, rather than describing how each potential factor structures the chromosome mechanistically, we account for this at the coarse-grained level by describing all effects of known and unknown factors that shape the chromosome as an effective solvent. It is well established that the three-dimensional (3D) conformation of a polymer is directly affected by the interaction between the polymer and its solvent ( de Gennes, 1979 38. de Gennes, P.G. Scaling concepts in polymer physics Cornell University Press, 1979 Google Scholar ; Rubinstein, 2003 118. Rubinstein, M. Polymer physics Colby, R.H. (Editor) Oxford University Press, 2003 Crossref Google Scholar ). Based on the polymer-solvent interaction, the quality of a solvent is broadly classified into three types: good, ideal, and poor. In a good solvent, interactions between the polymer and the solvent are favored over interactions between polymer segments. Conversely, in a poor solvent, interactions between polymer segments are favored over their interactions with the solvent. When the repulsive and attractive interactions are balanced out (zero net interaction), the solvent is said to be ideal. How the bacterial cytoplasm (or eukaryotic nucleoplasm) behaves as a solvent for the chromosome remains an open question.
Here, we develop a live-cell experimental approach to estimate the apparent average mesh size of the nucleoid and infer the effective solvent quality of the cytoplasm in E. coli . We then describe experiments and simulations that connect this macroscopic description of the cytoplasm to chromosome folding, transcription, and intracellular organization.

Section: Results

Here, we considered the cell as a simple semidilute (i.e., concentrated) polymer solution in which the chromosome is assumed to be a random coil polymer and its solvent is everything in the cytoplasm except the DNA ( Figure 1 A). In polymer physics, a polymer solution is said to be semidilute when the polymer concentration is high enough that the polymer segments overlap to form a meshwork. The average mesh size (or correlation length) 𝜉 of such a meshwork depends not only on properties of the polymer (concentration, rigidity, molecular weight and monomer size) but also on the quality of the solvent ( de Gennes, 1979 38. de Gennes, P.G. Scaling concepts in polymer physics Cornell University Press, 1979 Google Scholar ; Rubinstein, 2003 118. Rubinstein, M. Polymer physics Colby, R.H. (Editor) Oxford University Press, 2003 Crossref Google Scholar ), as shown in Equation 1 (see STAR Methods for derivation). 𝜉 = √ 3 6 ⁢ 𝑏 𝜈 − 1 3 ⁢ 𝜈 − 1 ⁢ ( 1 8 ⁢ √ 3 ⁢ 𝑀 𝑤 𝜋 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑁 𝐴 ⁢ 𝑙 𝑏 ⁢ 𝑝 ) 𝜈 3 ⁢ 𝜈 − 1 (1) In this equation, 𝑁 𝐴 is Avogadro’s number and 𝑐 represents the average concentration of the polymer. In the context of the DNA, 𝑀 𝑤 and 𝑙 𝑏 ⁢ 𝑝 are the average molecular weight (650 g/mol) and the base pair size (0.34 nm), respectively ( Diekmann et al., 1982 42.

Chem. 1968; 243 :2618-2624 Abstract Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ), we estimate 𝑏 to be ∼60 nm ( STAR Methods ). The remaining term 𝜈 in Equation 1 is the Flory exponent, which relates to the solvent quality. It is equal to 0.5 for an ideal solvent and is smaller than 0.5 for a poor solvent and greater than 0.5 for a good solvent ( Rubinstein, 2003 118. Rubinstein, M. Polymer physics Colby, R.H. (Editor) Oxford University Press, 2003 Crossref Google Scholar ). Given our simplified view of the cell and the chromosome ( Figure 1 A), 𝜈 reflects the effective solvent quality of the cytoplasm for the chromosome. This parameter can be deduced by determining the concentration of the chromosomal DNA within the nucleoid region ( 𝑐 ) and the average mesh size of the nucleoid ( 𝜉 ) .
To determine the average concentration of DNA within the nucleoid, we took advantage that in nutrient-poor environments (e.g., glycerol as a carbon source), E. coli cells exhibit discrete B, C, and D periods, corresponding to the cell-cycle phases before, during, and after DNA replication, respectively ( Cooper and Helmstetter, 1968 31. Cooper, S. ∙ Helmstetter, C.E. Chromosome replication and the division cycle of Escherichia coli B/r J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 31 :519-540 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). In B-period cells, the DNA mass can be unambiguously determined, as each nucleoid in these cells consists of a single, non-replicating chromosome ( Cooper and Helmstetter, 1968 31. Cooper, S. ∙ Helmstetter, C.E. Chromosome replication and the division cycle of Escherichia coli B/r J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 31 :519-540 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Using a previously described method ( Gray et al., 2019 49. Gray, W.T. ∙ Govers, S.K. ∙ Xiang, Y. ... Nucleoid Size Scaling and Intracellular Organization of Translation across Bacteria Cell. 2019; 177 :1632-1648.e1620 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ), we identified B-period cells within a population by examining cell size and the spatial pattern of the DNA replication marker SeqA fused to mCherry ( Figures 1 B, 1C, and S1 A; STAR Methods ). We found that DAPI-stained nucleoids consisting of one chromosome have an average volume of ∼0.7 μm 3 ( Figure 1 D). The mass of the E. coli chromosome is ∼5 × 10 −12 mg given that this chromosome is made of ∼4.6 × 10 6 base pairs and that the average molecular weight of a base pair is 650 g/mol ( Lee et al., 2012 76.

From this, we determined the average DNA concentration within the nucleoid region to be 7.1 ± 1.0 mg/mL (mean ± SD), whether cells were grown at 30°C or 37°C ( Figures 1 E and S1 B).

Biol. 2015; 11 :836 Crossref Scopus (69) PubMed Google Scholar ) to DNA concentrations within the nucleoid volume ( 𝑐 ) by taking into consideration changes in cell and nucleoid volumes, we obtained 𝑐 = 7.4 ± 0.2 mg/mL (mean ± SD; STAR Methods ). The agreement between this estimation and our single-cell measurements ( Figures 1 E and S1 B) indicates that 𝑐 remains largely constant across nutrient-poor and nutrient-rich conditions. This is consistent with both DNA content per cell and nucleoid size scaling with cell size across growth conditions ( Basan et al., 2015 8. Basan, M. ∙ Zhu, M. ∙ Dai, X. ...

Given a 𝑐 ≈ 7 mg/mL, the next variable to determine was the mesh size ( 𝜉 ) . Studies on biopolymer solutions and hydrogels have demonstrated that particles of size much smaller than the average mesh size diffuse freely through the meshwork ( Axpe et al., 2019 4.

Lett. 2004; 92 :178101 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ). When the probe size is close to the average mesh size, the probe dynamics becomes impacted by the polymer mesh. This impact exacerbates with increasing probe size. In the context of the cell, this implies that probes much smaller than the nucleoid mesh size will diffuse freely in the cytoplasm without any apparent hindrance from the nucleoid (assuming that the particles do not interact with the nucleoid). Such probes will have an equal probability of diffusing inside or outside the nucleoid. In contrast, probes larger than the average mesh size will have a higher probability of diffusing outside the nucleoid, leading to greater nucleoid exclusion with increasing probe size.
To probe the nucleoid mesh size, we first used an E. coli strain (CJW6340) that expresses a GFP-tagged, artificially designed protein that self-assembles into a 60-subunit dodecahedron nanocage of 25 nm ( Figure 2 A) ( Hsia et al., 2016 58. Hsia, Y. ∙ Bale, J.B. ∙ Gonen, S. ... Design of a hyperstable 60-subunit protein dodecahedron. [corrected] Nature. 2016; 535 :136-139 Crossref Scopus (187) PubMed Google Scholar ). Basal expression of nanocage-GFP proteins (i.e., leaky synthesis) was sufficient to produce a single nanocage-GFP particle per cell in a fraction of the population ( Figure 2 B). Single-particle tracking experiments revealed no evidence of steric hindrance by the nucleoid, as the nanocage-GFP particle appeared to diffuse freely throughout the cytoplasm ( Figure 2 C; Video S1 ). The slope of the ensemble-averaged mean squared displacement (MSD) curve (n = 85 particle trajectories) was close to 1 in the log-log scale ( Figure 2 D), consistent with Brownian motion (note that the deviation of the MSD from the linearity at long-timescale is due to cell confinement). Furthermore, ensemble calculation of the relative positions of nanocage-GFP particles inside cells demonstrated that the probability density of nanocage-GFP localization is uniform throughout the cytoplasm ( Figure 2 E; n = 2,500 localizations). Thus, these 25-nm probes were neither trapped nor excluded by the nucleoid, consistent with their diffusion being Brownian. This result indicates that the apparent average nucleoid mesh size is >25 nm.

Therefore, we switched to GFP-μNS particles, which are larger probes that our laboratory previously developed to probe the material properties of the cytoplasm ( Parry et al., 2014 101. Parry, B.R. ∙ Surovtsev, I.V. ∙ Cabeen, M.T. ... The bacterial cytoplasm has glass-like properties and is fluidized by metabolic activity Cell. 2014; 156 :183-194 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (370) PubMed Google Scholar ). GFP-μNS is a green fluorescent protein fused to a mammalian reovirus protein that self-assembles into a globular complex ( Broering et al., 2002 17. Broering, T.J. ∙ Parker, J.S.L. ∙ Joyce, P.L. ... Mammalian reovirus nonstructural protein microNS forms large inclusions and colocalizes with reovirus microtubule-associated protein micro2 in transfected cells J. Virol. 2002; 76 :8285-8297 Crossref Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar , 2005 18. Broering, T.J. ∙ Arnold, M.M. ∙ Miller, C.L. ... Carboxyl-proximal regions of reovirus nonstructural protein muNS necessary and sufficient for forming factory-like inclusions J. Virol. 2005; 79 :6194-6206 Crossref Scopus (66) PubMed Google Scholar ). When expressed from the chromosome of E. coli (CJW4617) following IPTG induction ( STAR Methods ), GFP-μNS assembled into fluorescent particles, usually one per cell ( Parry et al., 2014 101. Parry, B.R. ∙ Surovtsev, I.V. ∙ Cabeen, M.T. ... The bacterial cytoplasm has glass-like properties and is fluidized by metabolic activity Cell. 2014; 156 :183-194 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (370) PubMed Google Scholar ). The size of the GFP-μNS particles, which was deduced by establishing a calibration between the particle sizes and their corresponding fluorescence intensities ( Parry et al., 2014 101. Parry, B.R. ∙ Surovtsev, I.V. ∙ Cabeen, M.T. ... The bacterial cytoplasm has glass-like properties and is fluidized by metabolic activity Cell. 2014; 156 :183-194 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (370) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( STAR Methods ), ranged from ∼50 to ∼200 nm based on the level of protein expression in each cell ( Figure S2 ).
We imaged GFP-μNS particles (n = 133,692) and calculated their relative positions in the corresponding cells from static images. We then binned all GFP-μNS particles by size and constructed probability density maps that indicate the likelihood of finding a GFP-μNS particle at a specific intracellular location across cells. For particles with the smallest average particle size (51 nm), the probability density map appeared almost indistinguishable from that obtained for nanocage-GFP particles ( Figures 2 E and 2F). This pattern changed in the next size bin, as probes of an average size of 58 nm started to display an increased probability to be localized at the cell pole regions (i.e., away from the nucleoid). This enrichment in probability density of localization at the cell poles continued to increase with probe size ( Figures 2 F and 2G), with ever-larger particles becoming less and less likely to be found within the nucleoid region. Particles with the largest average size (150 nm) were almost completely excluded from the nucleoid, as shown by the high probability density of localization at the cell poles and the near-zero probability density elsewhere in the cell. While these ensemble results cannot provide an exact value, they estimate the apparent average nucleoid mesh size to be around 50 nm.
Based on 𝑐 ≈ 7 mg/mL, 𝑏 ≈6 0 nm, and 𝜉 ≈ 50 nm, we found that the corresponding 𝜈 would be ∼0.36 ( Equation 1 ). Such a small exponent (< 0.5) implies that the E. coli cytoplasm effectively behaves as a poor solvent for the chromosome. Since probes can start “feeling” a meshwork at sizes lower than the mesh size ( Wong et al., 2004 160. Wong, I.Y. ∙ Gardel, M.L. ∙ Reichman, D.R. ... Anomalous diffusion probes microstructure dynamics of entangled F-actin networks Phys. Rev. Lett. 2004; 92 :178101 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ), our 𝜉 value may be underestimated. However, a mesh size greater than 50 nm would result in an even smaller 𝜈 value. The conclusion that the cytoplasm acts as a poor solvent is also robust against variability in DNA concentration across cells ( Figure 1 E) or nutrient-poor or -rich growth conditions (see above). For instance, a DNA concentration of 8 mg/mL (or higher) would correspond to a smaller 𝜈 ( Figure S3 A). At DNA concentrations of 6 mg/mL or as low as 5 mg/mL, 𝜈 would remain well below 0.5 ( Figure S3 A). In addition, our conclusion appears robust to reasonable variations in DNA Kuhn length due to potential fluctuations in cytoplasmic ionic strength. In our model, to achieve an apparent ∼50-nm mesh size in an ideal ( 𝜈 = 0.5) or good ( 𝜈 = 0.58) solvent, the Kuhn length of a polymer at an average concentration of 7 mg/mL would have to be 26 nm or 13 nm, respectively (i.e., persistence length ≤13 nm). Such a small value has not been observed experimentally even in solutions of extremely high ionic strength (e.g., 3–4 M NaCl) ( Borochov et al., 1981 13. Borochov, N. ∙ Eisenberg, H. ∙ Kam, Z. Dependence of DNA conformation on the concentration of salt Biopolymers. 1981; 20 :231-235 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Kam et al., 1981 65. Kam, Z. ∙ Borochov, N. ∙ Eisenberg, H.

Baumann, C.G. ∙ Smith, S.B. ∙ Bloomfield, V.A. ... Ionic effects on the elasticity of single DNA molecules Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Intriguingly, for 𝑏 ≈ 60 nm and 𝑐 ≈ 7 mg/mL, Equation 1 indicates that the average mesh size decreases as 𝜈 increases (i.e., as the solvent quality improves) ( Figure S3 A). To probe the potential origin of this dependence, we performed 3D Monte Carlo simulations of chromosome conformation ( STAR Methods ). For all simulations, we modeled the E. coli chromosome as a freely jointed phantom chain. The solvent quality was simply modeled by tuning the constraint on the range of angles between neighboring DNA segments ( STAR Methods ). These constraints were empirically chosen so that the power law scaling between the polymer radius of gyration and the number of segments had an exponent equal to 𝜈 = 0.36 (poor), 0.50 (ideal), and 0.58 (good) at small length scales ( Figure S3 B). Note that in a semidilute polymer solution, at large length scales, the interactions among monomers become screened such that the scaling exponent converges to 0.5 ( Rubinstein, 2003 118. Rubinstein, M. Polymer physics Colby, R.H. (Editor) Oxford University Press, 2003 Crossref Google Scholar ); this crossover also occurs in our simulations ( Figure S3 B, inset). To achieve the average DNA concentration observed in actual nucleoids (7 mg/mL), we confined the entire chromosome within the average nucleoid volume (0.70 μm 3 ) in B-period cells ( Figure 1 D).
The simulations revealed a drastic difference in chromosomal conformation across the “solvent quality” conditions ( Video S2 ). The DNA density appeared to be much more spatially heterogeneous in the poor solvent condition relative to the ideal and good solvent conditions. This was evident in cross-sectional slices of simulated chromosomes in which each dot represents a DNA segment crossing the plane ( Figure 3 A). The spatial heterogeneity of DNA density in the poor solvent condition compared to the other conditions was also apparent in the two-dimensional (2D) histograms showing the probability density of finding a DNA segment inside the nucleoid region ( Figure 3 B). Gratifyingly, this result is consistent with the spatial heterogeneity of DNA density observed in super-resolution fluorescence images of bacterial nucleoids ( Le Gall et al., 2016 75.

Simulated chromosomes in different types of solvent conditions, related to Figure 3 This video shows a 3D overview of chromosomes simulated in confinement of a spherocylinder with a volume equal to that of an average nucleoid (∼0.7 μm 3 ). From left to right, the solvent was assumed to be poor ( 𝜈 = 0.36), ideal ( 𝜈 = 0.50) and good ( 𝜈 = 0.58). In all three cases, the Kuhn length of the DNA was assumed to be 60 nm.
In the poor solvent simulations, DNA segments were often closer to each other, leading to the formation of regions with high DNA density interspersed with regions of low DNA density. This spatial heterogeneity in DNA density created “holes” ( Figures 3 A and 3B; Video S2 ), which may increase the apparent average mesh size and allow larger objects to pass through the nucleoid. Meanwhile, the DNA density of the nucleoid was more spatially homogeneous in the ideal and good solvent conditions ( Figures 3 A and 3B; Video S2 ), likely contributing to the smaller average mesh size.
The denser, domain-like regions of the nucleoid in the poor solvent simulations reminded us of CIDs reported in Hi-C studies in E. coli and other bacteria ( Le et al., 2013 74.

Bacillus subtilis SMC complexes juxtapose chromosome arms as they travel from origin to terminus Science. 2017; 355 :524-527 Crossref Scopus (123) PubMed Google Scholar ). To examine this more closely, we created average maps that show the average distances (over 10 simulations) between any given pair of DNA loci along the entire simulated chromosomes ( Figure 3 C) or a 500-kb region ( Figure 3 D) under a poor, ideal, or good solvent condition. Dark patches along the diagonal in the distance maps demarcate individual domain-like structures, in which DNA loci separated by a relatively large genomic distance remain in close spatial proximity to each other. Large domain-like structures were only seen under the poor solvent condition ( Figures 3 C and 3D). Our results suggest that by itself, an effective poor solvent quality of the cytoplasm can promote the formation of chromosomal domains that are reminiscent of CIDs seen in Hi-C experiments (see Discussion for further comments and additional simulations).
If an effective poor solvent quality promotes spatial heterogeneity of DNA density in the cell, this may, in turn, affect the spatial distribution of other cytoplasmic components, even within the nucleoid region. Ribosomes, which exist mostly in polyribosome form, are well known to be enriched outside of the nucleoid region ( Azam et al., 2000 5. Azam, T.A. ∙ Hiraga, S. ∙ Ishihama, A.

USA. 2014; 111 :11413-11418 Crossref Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ). We hypothesized that ribosomes may also be heterogeneously distributed throughout the nucleoid based on its uneven DNA density. To test this hypothesis, we performed cryoelectron tomography (cryo-ET) after cryo-focused ion beam (cryo-FIB) milling on frozen-hydrated samples of E. coli cells (MG1655) ( Figures 4 A and S4 ; STAR Methods ). Tomographic reconstruction and ribosome localization ( Videos S3 and S4 ; STAR Methods ) revealed that the density of ribosomes was highly heterogeneous across lamellae ( Figures 4 B–4E and see Figure S5 A for statistics on tomograms). This was readily apparent after the Gaussian smoothing of the ribosome density map ( Figures 4 F and S5 B). In addition to the expected accumulation of ribosomes at the cell periphery, ribosomes displayed heterogeneity in density across the cytoplasm, including within the central region of the cell (i.e., nucleoid region).

Since DNA cannot be directly visualized in the tomograms, we turned to fluorescence microscopy to examine whether the spatial heterogeneity in ribosome density within the nucleoid region is associated with differences in DNA densities. We imaged DAPI-stained E. coli cells (CJW7020) producing 50S ribosomal protein L1 tagged with monomeric superfolder GFP ( Figures 5 A and 5B). As before, in each cell (n = 1,126), we identified the nucleoid outlines based on the DAPI signal (dotted lines in Figures 5 A and 5B). When calculating the correlation between the DNA and ribosome fluorescence signals, we considered only image pixels well within the nucleoid region (at least two pixels away from the nucleoid outline; third row images in Figures 5 A and 5B) to prevent any bias in the correlation analysis due to the well-known enrichment of ribosomes outside the nucleoid region. We found that even well within the nucleoid, the ribosome fluorescence signal correlates negatively with the DNA signal, as shown by two cell examples ( Figures 5 C and 5D). This was also observed at the population level (n = 1,126 cells, Figure 5 E). These findings are consistent with the idea that the effective poor solvent quality of the cytoplasm contributes to the uneven DNA density, which, in turn, affects ribosome localization (or the other way around).
A polymer is intrinsically more compact in a poor solvent, because polymer segments preferentially interact with themselves rather than with the solvent. In our previous Monte Carlo simulations, the chromosome was modeled within the experimentally determined nucleoid volume (0.7 μm 3 ) to keep the DNA concentration constant (i.e., 7 mg/mL) across solvent types. If our simulation approach reproduces expected solvent effects, then performing the same Monte Carlo simulations, this time in an unbounded space to allow the DNA concentration to change ( STAR Methods ), should result in simulated chromosomes being the most compact in the poor solvent condition. Simulation results validated this expectation ( Video S5 ) and showed that the effective poor solvent quality of the cytoplasm can result in up to ∼60-fold chromosome compaction compared to a good solvent ( Figure 6 ). We note that this solvent effect alone cannot explain the full compaction of a single chromosome inside cells, as the actual volume of a single-chromosome nucleoid in cells ( Figure 1 D) is still ∼10 times smaller ( Figure 6 , inset). This is not surprising given the simplicity of our model; it highlights the complexity of the cell and the multifactorial origin of chromosome compaction (see Discussion ).

We expect that a combination of factors contributes to the observed poor solvent quality of the cytoplasm for the chromosome (see Discussion ). Among these factors, we find RNAs to be attractive candidates. Indeed, treatment of E. coli with rifampicin (Rif), which blocks transcription initiation and leads to mRNA depletion due to the short lifetime of most bacterial mRNAs ( Bernstein et al., 2002 10.

Zimmerman, S.B. Toroidal nucleoids in Escherichia coli exposed to chloramphenicol J. Struct. Biol. 2002; 138 :199-206 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ). These observations have been interpreted as a consequence of a loss or gain of polyribosome crowding in Rif- or Cpl-treated cells, respectively ( Bakshi et al., 2012 6. Bakshi, S. ∙ Siryaporn, A. ∙ Goulian, M. ... Superresolution imaging of ribosomes and RNA polymerase in live Escherichia coli cells Mol.

Entropy-based mechanism of ribosome-nucleoid segregation in E. coli cells Biophys. J. 2011; 100 :2605-2613 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ). The idea is that the large size of polyribosomes leads to entropy-driven polyribosome/DNA segregation and chromosome compaction through excluded volume effects. However, Rif and Cpl treatments also affect the levels of mRNAs in opposite direction. Furthermore, rRNA synthesis is also impacted by these drug treatments. rRNA synthesis stops with transcription inhibition (Rif), while it persists when proteins synthesis (Cpl) is inhibited ( Cole et al., 1987 30. Cole, J.R. ∙ Olsson, C.L. ∙ Hershey, J.W. ... Feedback regulation of rRNA synthesis in Escherichia coli. Requirement for initiation factor IF2 J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198 :383-392 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Hernandez and Bremer, 1990 55. Hernandez, V.J. ∙ Bremer, H.

Biol. 1962; 4 :193-210 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, another mutually nonexclusive interpretation of the drug-induced phenotypes is that the chemical nature of the RNAs, and not exclusively the size of the polyribosomes, plays a role in controlling nucleoid size by affecting the effective solvent quality for the chromosome.
If polyribosome crowding is the primary contributor of nucleoid compaction, then this hypothesis predicts that a reduced abundance in polyribosomes will lead to nucleoid expansion even when transcription is unaffected. To test this possibility, we treated E. coli cells with 5 mg/mL kasugamycin (Ksg), a translation initiation inhibitor of canonical RNAs (i.e., transcripts with a leader sequence) ( Schluenzen et al., 2006 121. Schluenzen, F. ∙ Takemoto, C. ∙ Wilson, D.N. ... The antibiotic kasugamycin mimics mRNA nucleotides to destabilize tRNA binding and inhibit canonical translation initiation Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13 :871-878 Crossref Scopus (91) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tai et al., 1973 139. Tai, P.C. ∙ Wallace, B.J. ∙ Davis, B.D. Actions of aurintricarboxylate, kasugamycin, and pactamycin on Escherichia coli polysomes Biochemistry. 1973; 12 :616-620 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). At this concentration, Ksg has been shown to reduce the abundance of polyribosomes by converting a significant fraction of them into free ribosomal subunits and ribosome-free mRNAs ( Bakshi et al., 2014 7. Bakshi, S. ∙ Choi, H. ∙ Mondal, J. ... Time-dependent effects of transcription- and translation-halting drugs on the spatial distributions of the Escherichia coli chromosome and ribosomes Mol. Microbiol. 2014; 94 :871-887 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ). Contrary to prediction, we found that DAPI-stained cells do not expand their nucleoids after incubation (40 min) with Ksg, unlike with Rif ( Figures 7 A and S6 A). In fact, most nucleoids in Ksg-treated cells appeared more compact, consistent with a previous study ( Bakshi et al., 2014 7. Bakshi, S. ∙ Choi, H. ∙ Mondal, J. ... Time-dependent effects of transcription- and translation-halting drugs on the spatial distributions of the Escherichia coli chromosome and ribosomes Mol. Microbiol. 2014; 94 :871-887 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ). Quantification of a time-course experiment in which cells were imaged after Rif or Ksg treatment for 20 to 80 min revealed a large overlap of size distributions between drug-treated and untreated cells ( Figure 7 B). The nucleocytoplasmic (NC) ratio (nucleoid area divided by cell area) increased following Rif treatment ( Figure 7 C), as expected for nucleoid expansion. In contrast, the NC ratio decreased over time in Ksg-treated cells ( Figure 7 C), indicative of nucleoid compaction. These results conflict with the polyribosome crowding hypothesis.
In the drug experiments, we also imaged RNAs using SYTO RNASelect ( Figures 7 A and S6 A), a fluorogenic RNA-specific dye that has been validated for use in live E. coli cells ( Bakshi et al., 2014 7. Bakshi, S. ∙ Choi, H. ∙ Mondal, J. ... Time-dependent effects of transcription- and translation-halting drugs on the spatial distributions of the Escherichia coli chromosome and ribosomes Mol. Microbiol. 2014; 94 :871-887 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ). For the untreated cell population, we found that the correlation between the RNASelect and DAPI signals varies across cells ( Figure 7 D), as quantified by the signal correlation factor (SCF) ( Gray et al., 2019 49. Gray, W.T. ∙ Govers, S.K. ∙ Xiang, Y. ... Nucleoid Size Scaling and Intracellular Organization of Translation across Bacteria Cell. 2019; 177 :1632-1648.e1620 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ). As expected ( Bakshi et al., 2014 7. Bakshi, S. ∙ Choi, H. ∙ Mondal, J. ... Time-dependent effects of transcription- and translation-halting drugs on the spatial distributions of the Escherichia coli chromosome and ribosomes Mol. Microbiol. 2014; 94 :871-887 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ), transcription inhibition by Rif led to a decrease in RNASelect signal ( Figure 7 A) ( Bakshi et al., 2014 7. Bakshi, S. ∙ Choi, H. ∙ Mondal, J. ... Time-dependent effects of transcription- and translation-halting drugs on the spatial distributions of the Escherichia coli chromosome and ribosomes Mol. Microbiol. 2014; 94 :871-887 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ), consistent with a reduced level of mRNAs due to their common short lifetime ( Bernstein et al., 2002 10. Bernstein, J.A. ∙ Khodursky, A.B. ∙ Lin, P.H. ... Global analysis of mRNA decay and abundance in Escherichia coli at single-gene resolution using two-color fluorescent DNA microarrays Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99 :9697-9702 Crossref Scopus (571) PubMed Google Scholar ). The remaining RNASelect signal was positively correlated with the DAPI staining in Rif-treated cells ( Figure 7 D). In striking contrast, in Ksg-treated cells where the levels of mRNAs and rRNAs, respectively depleted of ribosomes or ribosomal proteins, are expected to increase, the RNASelect and DAPI signals appeared to segregate from each other ( Figures 7 A and S6 A). This segregation gave rise to strongly negative SCF values ( Figure 7 D). A potential role for RNAs in compacting the nucleoid was also supported at the single-cell level. This was suggested by (1) the negative correlation between the RNASelect signal and the NC ratio across Ksg-treated cells ( Figure 7 E) and (2) the trend for cells with smaller NC ratios to have more negative SCF values between the RNASelect and DAPI signals ( Figure 7 E). We observed the same trends in untreated cells, albeit to a lesser degree ( Figure S6 B). These results may suggest the higher the RNA level, the greater the segregation between RNAs and DNA and the more compacted the nucleoid.
We also noted a significant reduction in the fraction of cells with two discernable nucleoids in the Rif- and Ksg-treated populations relative to the untreated condition, as shown in demographs of cell populations ( Figure 7 F). For the Rif condition, this was easily explained by the expansion of the two nucleoids into the previously DNA-free internucleoid space. Such a trivial explanation could not apply to the Ksg condition, since Ksg compacts nucleoids over time. A reduced fraction in cells with two discernable nucleoids could also not be explained by a difference in cell size distribution ( Figure 7 B). To examine the origin of the phenotype, we performed time-lapse imaging on agarose pads containing Ksg. Nucleoids were visualized using a mCherry fusion to the NAP HU. We found that when cells started with two nucleoids, Ksg treatment often resulted in the nucleoids seemingly moving toward each other ( Video S6 ) and almost coalescing ( Video S7 ). This coalescence likely minimizes the interfacial interaction and promotes the separation between the nucleoid and RNA. Altogether, our results support the hypothesis that RNAs contribute to the effective poor solvent quality of the cytoplasm for the chromosome through an energetically unfavorable (i.e., repulsive) interaction between DNA and RNA.

Section: Discussion

Several factors are likely to contribute to the effective poor solvent quality of the cytoplasm. In our simplified view of the cell, the solvent is everything in the cytoplasm apart from the DNA polymer. In this context, NAPs are part of the solvent and therefore may be one of the factors due to their high abundance and well-known interactions with the chromosome. The potential role of NAPs may be direct or indirect. Some NAPs have been shown to bridge DNA segments or generate loops ( Dame et al., 2019 36. Dame, R.T. ∙ Rashid, F.M. ∙ Grainger, D.C. Chromosome organization in bacteria: mechanistic insights into genome structure and function Nat. Rev. Genet. 2019; PubMed Google Scholar ; Dillon and Dorman, 2010 43. Dillon, S.C. ∙ Dorman, C.J. Bacterial nucleoid-associated proteins, nucleoid structure and gene expression Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2010; 8 :185-195 Crossref Scopus (524) PubMed Google Scholar ), which may be macroscopically described as increasing polymer interaction. In addition, we speculate that NAPs, and potentially other DNA-binding proteins (such as transcriptional regulators), may act as an interface that indirectly modulates the chemical interaction between the chromosome and other components of the cytoplasm. Protein binding to the anionic DNA polymer could, for instance, locally alter the electrostatic potential of the chromosome. The effects may alter the compaction and mesh size of the nucleoid. It is important to note that NAP binding may also reduce the DNA Kuhn length, for instance, by bending, twisting or screening the DNA ( Dame et al., 2019 36. Dame, R.T. ∙ Rashid, F.M. ∙ Grainger, D.C. Chromosome organization in bacteria: mechanistic insights into genome structure and function Nat. Rev. Genet. 2019; PubMed Google Scholar ; Dillon and Dorman, 2010 43. Dillon, S.C. ∙ Dorman, C.J. Bacterial nucleoid-associated proteins, nucleoid structure and gene expression Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2010; 8 :185-195 Crossref Scopus (524) PubMed Google Scholar ). In other instances, some NAPs may increase the DNA Kuhn length depending on their (local) concentration. For example, in vitro studies have shown that at low concentration, HU bends the DNA, locally increasing its flexibility ( Skoko et al., 2004 128. Skoko, D. ∙ Wong, B. ∙ Johnson, R.C. ... Micromechanical analysis of the binding of DNA-bending proteins HMGB1, NHP6A, and HU reveals their ability to form highly stable DNA-protein complexes Biochemistry. 2004; 43 :13867-13874 Crossref Scopus (115) PubMed Google Scholar ; van Noort et al., 2004 143. van Noort, J. ∙ Verbrugge, S. ∙ Goosen, N. ... Dual architectural roles of HU: formation of flexible hinges and rigid filaments Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101 :6969-6974 Crossref Scopus (233) PubMed Google Scholar ). Conversely, at high concentration, HU stiffens the DNA by coating it and forming a rigid filament.

Schultz, S.G. ∙ Wilson, N.L. ∙ Epstein, W. Cation transport in Escherichia coli. II. Intracellular chloride concentration J. Gen. Physiol. 1962; 46 :159-166 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) may also contribute to the poor solvent effects of the cytoplasm as well as the Kuhn length of the DNA. In vitro studies have shown that the net interaction between DNA fragments becomes less repulsive with increasing salt concentrations ( Nicolai and Mandel, 1989 97. Nicolai, T. ∙ Mandel, M. The ionic strength dependence of the second virial coefficient of low molar mass DNA fragments in aqueous solutions Macromolecules. 1989; 22 :438-444 Crossref Google Scholar ). Divalent Mg 2+ has been found to not only screen charges on DNA but also induce attraction between DNA segments ( Qiu et al., 2007 111. Qiu, X. ∙ Andresen, K. ∙ Kwok, L.W. ... Inter-DNA attraction mediated by divalent counterions Phys. Rev. Lett. 2007; 99 :038104 Crossref Scopus (99) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Another important factor to consider is the crowded nature of the cytoplasm. Indeed, molecular dynamics simulations suggest that macromolecular crowding can be viewed as effectively reducing the quality of the solvent ( Jeon et al., 2016 61. Jeon, C. ∙ Jung, Y. ∙ Ha, B.-Y. Effects of molecular crowding and confinement on the spatial organization of a biopolymer Soft Matter. 2016; 12 :9436-9450 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Polyribosomes or proteins are generally evoked as the principal cytoplasmic crowders that compact the nucleoid ( Mondal et al., 2011 95. Mondal, J. ∙ Bratton, B.P. ∙ Li, Y. ...

USA. 2012; 109 :E2649-E2656 Crossref Scopus (126) PubMed Google Scholar ). Both of them are plausible crowders because polyribosomes are large in size compared to proteins, but proteins are far more abundant ( Kim et al., 2015 68. Kim, J. ∙ Jeon, C. ∙ Jeong, H. ...

Both size and abundance are important determinants of depletion forces associated with excluded volume effects ( Asakura and Oosawa, 1954 3. Asakura, S. ∙ Oosawa, F. On Interaction between Two Bodies Immersed in a Solution of Macromolecules J. Chem. Phys. 1954; 22 :1255-1256 Crossref Google Scholar ). While macromolecular crowding is widely believed to be play a major, if not the predominant, role in chromosome compaction, it is worth noting that the interpretations of the experimental data supporting this view are not always clear cut. As mentioned earlier, the well-known opposite effects of Rif and Cpl treatment on nucleoid size may be due to a change in not only polyribosome abundance but also RNA levels. According to the crowding hypothesis, Ksg treatment, which reduces polyribosome abundance ( Bakshi et al., 2014 7. Bakshi, S. ∙ Choi, H. ∙ Mondal, J. ... Time-dependent effects of transcription- and translation-halting drugs on the spatial distributions of the Escherichia coli chromosome and ribosomes Mol. Microbiol. 2014; 94 :871-887 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ), should result in nucleoid expansion. Instead, Ksg treatment leads to nucleoid compaction over time ( Figures 7 A, 7C, and S6 A; Videos S6 and S7 ). As for proteins, their proposed role as crowders is primarily based on in vitro experiments showing that flexible uncharged polymers such as poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) condense isolated nucleoids ( Cunha et al., 2001 34. Cunha, S. ∙ Woldringh, C.L. ∙ Odijk, T. Polymer-mediated compaction and internal dynamics of isolated Escherichia coli nucleoids J. Struct. Biol. 2001; 136 :53-66 Crossref Scopus (98) PubMed Google Scholar ; Pelletier et al., 2012 104. Pelletier, J. ∙ Halvorsen, K. ∙ Ha, B.Y. ... Physical manipulation of the Escherichia coli chromosome reveals its soft nature Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109 :E2649-E2656 Crossref Scopus (126) PubMed Google Scholar ). This DNA condensation occurs at molecular weights and concentrations (packing fractions) of PEG that are biologically relevant for proteins. However, PEG is not chemically inert and has been shown to mediate non-steric interactions ( Sheth and Leckband, 1997 127. Sheth, S.R. ∙ Leckband, D. Measurements of attractive forces between proteins and end-grafted poly(ethylene glycol) chains Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1997; 94 :8399-8404 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, flexible polymers like PEG are thought to be more efficient at condensing DNA than globular proteins due to differences in translational entropy and interaction surface ( Castelnovo and Gelbart, 2004 24. Castelnovo, M. ∙ Gelbart, W.M. Semiflexible Chain Condensation by Neutral Depleting Agents: Role of Correlations between Depletants Macromolecules. 2004; 37 :3510-3517 Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ; de Vries, 2006 39. de Vries, R. Depletion-induced instability in protein-DNA mixtures: Influence of protein charge and size J. Chem. Phys. 2006; 125 :014905 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ). To be clear, we do not dispute a role for polyribosomes or proteins in nucleoid compaction through excluded volume effects. We merely suggest that non-steric interactions and other cytoplasmic components may also be involved.
For instance, RNAs could play such a role. As mentioned above, global inhibition of RNA synthesis by Rif treatment results in nucleoid expansion ( Figures 7 A, 7C, and S6 A) ( Bakshi et al., 2012 6.

The effects of polydisperse crowders on the compaction of the Escherichia coli nucleoid Mol. Microbiol. 2020; 113 :1022-1037 Crossref Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, nucleoid decondensation also occurs when rRNA synthesis is inhibited through induction of the stringent response ( Cabrera and Jin, 2003 19. Cabrera, J.E. ∙ Jin, D.J. The distribution of RNA polymerase in Escherichia coli is dynamic and sensitive to environmental cues Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50 :1493-1505 Crossref Scopus (133) PubMed Google Scholar ). Conversely, inhibition of translation elongation by Cpl is associated with nucleoid compaction ( Bakshi et al., 2012 6. Bakshi, S. ∙ Siryaporn, A. ∙ Goulian, M. ...

Zimmerman, S.B. Toroidal nucleoids in Escherichia coli exposed to chloramphenicol J. Struct. Biol. 2002; 138 :199-206 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ). This effect may be linked to an increase in RNA levels, since Clp treatment results in stabilization of mRNAs ( Lopez et al., 1998 82. Lopez, P.J. ∙ Marchand, I. ∙ Yarchuk, O. ...

Schneider, E. ∙ Blundell, M. ∙ Kennell, D. Translation and mRNA decay Mol. Gen. Genet. 1978; 160 :121-129 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, there is probably an accumulation of “free” rRNAs (i.e., depleted of ribosomal proteins), as rRNA synthesis persists in the absence of protein production ( Cole et al., 1987 30. Cole, J.R. ∙ Olsson, C.L. ∙ Hershey, J.W. ... Feedback regulation of rRNA synthesis in Escherichia coli. Requirement for initiation factor IF2 J. Mol.

Biol. 1962; 4 :193-210 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Similarly, inhibition of translation initiation by Ksg, which increases the concentration of ribosome-depleted mRNAs, compacts the nucleoid ( Figures 7 A, 7C, and S6 A). Moreover, as with any form of translation inhibition ( Cole et al., 1987 30. Cole, J.R. ∙ Olsson, C.L. ∙ Hershey, J.W. ... Feedback regulation of rRNA synthesis in Escherichia coli.

Biol. 1962; 4 :193-210 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), Ksg treatment is expected to cause an accumulation of free rRNAs, and this is associated with compaction and coalescence of separated nucleoids ( Figure 7 F; Video S7 ). Interestingly, nucleoid fusion was also reported for Cpl-treated cells over six decades ago ( Schaechter and Laing, 1961 120. Schaechter, M. ∙ Laing, V.O. Direct observation of fusion of bacterial nuclei J. Bacteriol. 1961; 81 :667-668 Crossref Scopus (7) PubMed Google Scholar ; van Helvoort et al., 1996 142. van Helvoort, J.M. ∙ Kool, J. ∙ Woldringh, C.L. Chloramphenicol causes fusion of separated nucleoids in Escherichia coli K-12 cells and filaments J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178 :4289-4293 Crossref Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ). Importantly, in both untreated and Ksg-treated cells, a high RNA signal level is correlated with greater RNA/DNA segregation and nucleoid compaction ( Figures 7 E and S6 B).
Other observations are consistent with RNAs contributing to the effective poor solvent quality of the cytoplasm. For instance, gene loci have been shown to move toward the nucleoid periphery during transcription ( Libby et al., 2012 79. Libby, E.A. ∙ Roggiani, M. ∙ Goulian, M. Membrane protein expression triggers chromosomal locus repositioning in bacteria Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109 :7445-7450 Crossref Scopus (59) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yang et al., 2019 162. Yang, S. ∙ Kim, S. ∙ Kim, D.K. ... Transcription and translation contribute to gene locus relocation to the nucleoid periphery in E. coli Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :5131 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ). This has led to a model in which actively transcribed gene loci with their associated nascent mRNAs segregate away from the nucleoid bulk. Gene relocation is driven by transcription, though translation enhances it ( Yang et al., 2019 162. Yang, S. ∙ Kim, S. ∙ Kim, D.K. ... Transcription and translation contribute to gene locus relocation to the nucleoid periphery in E. coli Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :5131 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ). These observations support the idea that the interaction between RNA and DNA is energetically unfavorable. A tendency for DNA/RNA to demix may also explain why nucleoids appear more structured by fluorescence microscopy when cells are grown under nutrient-rich conditions (e.g., see Hadizadeh Yazdi et al., 2012 51. Hadizadeh Yazdi, N. ∙ Guet, C.C. ∙ Johnson, R.C. ... Variation of the folding and dynamics of the Escherichia coli chromosome with growth conditions Mol. Microbiol. 2012; 86 :1318-1333 Crossref Scopus (91) PubMed Google Scholar ). Under these fast-growth conditions, a large fraction of transcription is dedicated to rRNA synthesis at a few chromosomal locations. We speculate that this results in stronger compacting forces at sites of rRNA transcription relative to other chromosomal locations, producing unevenly shaped nucleoids. Comparatively, under slow-growth conditions, rRNA synthesis is reduced and transcription activities are more homogeneously distributed across the chromosome, potentially contributing to the smoother, more uniform nucleoid shape observed under these conditions.
Among all of the potential factors involved, we find transcription particularly interesting for several reasons: (1) transcription is dictated by the sequence of the DNA, meaning that the polymer itself may be able to affect the quality of its own solvent; (2) transcription is tunable, which may contribute to differences in chromosome folding across environmental conditions and bacterial species; and (3) both DNA and RNA are strong polyanions. Thus, in addition of repelling each other for steric reasons, their segregation may involve electrostatic interactions, in a phenomenon called “segregative phase separation” ( Joyeux, 2016 63. Joyeux, M. In vivo compaction dynamics of bacterial DNA: A fingerprint of DNA/RNA demixing? Curr. Opin. Colloid Interface Sci. 2016; 26 :17-27 Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar ).

Physiol. 1962; 46 :159-166 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), most negative charges on nucleic acids are screened. Therefore, any electrostatic repulsion would have to occur at short range (much like steric interactions). The tethering of RNAs to the DNA via RNA polymerases during transcription may facilitate short-range electrostatic interaction by keeping DNA and RNAs in proximity. It is also possible that other forms of non-steric interaction are involved. We hope that our work will motivate future studies that will test these hypotheses.
The bacterial chromosome is not simply compacted into cells; it is instead partitioned into various domains (CIDs) in which DNA loci preferentially interact with each other ( Le et al., 2013 74.

Wang, X. ∙ Le, T.B. ∙ Lajoie, B.R. ... Condensin promotes the juxtaposition of DNA flanking its loading site in Bacillus subtilis Genes Dev. 2015; 29 :1661-1675 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Our simulations suggest that the effective poor solvent quality of the cytoplasm may promote the spontaneous formation of chromosomal domains ( Figure 3 ; Video S2 ).
In these simulations, the DNA has no sequence information. Therefore, domains can form anywhere along the DNA polymer, as shown by randomly averaging 10 different simulated chromosomes ( Figure S7 A). As a result of this stochasticity, boundaries between domains blurred with each other and became undefined when 100 distance maps of simulated chromosomes were averaged ( Figure S7 B). Note that the presence of domains remained apparent in the poor solvent relative to the good or ideal solvent, as shown by the thicker signal along the diagonal of the averaged map. However, the blurring of the domain boundaries in the 100-chromosome averaged map is in contrast with Hi-C contact maps in which boundaries of CIDs remain visible despite averaging over billions of cells. In light of our findings, we propose that domain boundaries may result, at least in part, from energetically unfavorable interactions between DNA and RNAs, particularly at sites of highly expressed genes where transcripts are abundant. Consistent with this hypothesis, high transcriptional activity is an important determinant of CID boundaries ( Le et al., 2013 74. Le, T.B. ∙ Imakaev, M.V. ∙ Mirny, L.A. ...

Cell. 2015; 59 :588-602 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (142) PubMed Google Scholar ). In our simulations, the domains and their boundaries correspond to DNA regions of high and low densities, respectively. This also appears to be true inside cells, as the DNA at CID boundaries is less condensed (more extensible) than the DNA within CIDs ( Le and Laub, 2016 73. Le, T.B. ∙ Laub, M.T. Transcription rate and transcript length drive formation of chromosomal interaction domain boundaries EMBO J. 2016; 35 :1582-1595 Crossref Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ). At the domain boundary, high transcriptional activity leads to an accumulation of nascent RNAs. Since these RNAs are still bound to the DNA via RNA polymerases, they cannot diffuse away. We speculate that in order to minimize the contact with these bound RNAs, nearby DNA strands retract to the flanking sides, reducing their local density at the boundary while forming denser DNA regions (domains) on both sides of the boundary ( Figure S7 C). This would be mainly driven by the unfavorable interaction between DNA and RNAs and not by the steric blocking of ribosomes, as high transcription drives the local establishment of domain boundaries independently of translation ( Le and Laub, 2016 73. Le, T.B. ∙ Laub, M.T. Transcription rate and transcript length drive formation of chromosomal interaction domain boundaries EMBO J. 2016; 35 :1582-1595 Crossref Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To model the reduced local DNA density at a boundary, we performed additional simulations in which we varied the length ( 𝐿 ) and degree ( 𝜃 ) of DNA relaxation at regions arbitrarily centered at the 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-Mb coordinates ( STAR Methods ). Results based on averaging 1,000 simulated chromosomes showed that domain boundaries gradually appear and become increasingly sharper as the selected regions become longer (larger 𝐿 ) and more relaxed (lower 𝜃 ) ( Figure S7 D). These results corroborate the findings that both the rate of transcription and the length of the transcripts determine the formation of chromosomal domain boundaries ( Le and Laub, 2016 73. Le, T.B. ∙ Laub, M.T. Transcription rate and transcript length drive formation of chromosomal interaction domain boundaries EMBO J. 2016; 35 :1582-1595 Crossref Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ). Besides transcription, other factors, such as NAP binding and membrane attachment, also contribute to the predominance of specific domain boundaries across cells ( Lioy et al., 2018 80. Lioy, V.S. ∙ Cournac, A. ∙ Marbouty, M. ...

Bacteria lack nuclear membranes. As a result, the chromosome effectively functions as a mesh-like physical barrier that can affect the diffusion and spatial distribution of cytoplasmic components. Therefore, the mesh size of the nucleoid is an important length scale to consider. By assessing the degree of nucleoid exclusion for fluorescent probes of varying sizes (25–150 nm), we approximate the apparent average mesh size of the nucleoid to be around 50 nm in exponentially growing E. coli cells ( Figure 2 ). This length scale has several physiological implications. For instance, it predicts that the diffusion and spatial distribution of cytoplasmic components close or larger than this estimate are impacted by the presence of the nucleoid in the cytoplasm. We anticipate that some (possibly most) polyribosome species belong to this category. This reasoning is consistent with the single-molecule studies showing that ribosomes, which are mostly found as polyribosomes ( Dai et al., 2016 35. Dai, X. ∙ Zhu, M. ∙ Warren, M. ...

Once polyribosomes escape the nucleoid, they are less likely to get back inside the nucleoid due to their large size. Using a cryo-ET classification method based on the distances and orientations of ribosomes ( Bharat and Scheres, 2016 11. Bharat, T.A. ∙ Scheres, S.H.

This is consistent with analyses from single-molecule tracking studies ( Mohapatra and Weisshaar, 2018 92. Mohapatra, S. ∙ Weisshaar, J.C.

USA. 2014; 111 :11413-11418 Crossref Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ). We expect that the motion and therefore spatial distribution of large cellular components, such as storage granules, plasmids, microcompartments, and stress-induced protein aggregates, are also impacted by the nucleoid, for which there is evidence ( Chowdhury et al., 2014 29.

Conversely, the nucleoid allows cytoplasmic components of sizes well below 50 nm (e.g., metabolites, proteins, and most protein complexes) to diffuse across the nucleoid, facilitating biochemical reactions. Since the sizes of free ribosomal subunits are ∼23–26 nm ( Boublik, 1985 14. Boublik, M. Structure of the Escherichia coli Ribosome Nanninga, N. (Editor) Molecular cytology of Escherichia coli Academic Press, 1985 Google Scholar ; Verschoor et al., 1985 146. Verschoor, A. ∙ Frank, J. ∙ Boublik, M.

Biol. 1997; 118 :197-219 Crossref Scopus (132) PubMed Google Scholar ), the nucleoid mesh enables the coupling between transcription and translation by allowing free ribosomal subunits to reach nascent mRNAs within the nucleoid through diffusion, as previously suggested from ensemble single-molecule tracking experiments ( Mohapatra and Weisshaar, 2018 92. Mohapatra, S. ∙ Weisshaar, J.C. Functional mapping of the E. coli translational machinery using single-molecule tracking Mol. Microbiol. 2018; 110 :262-282 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sanamrad et al., 2014 119. Sanamrad, A. ∙ Persson, F. ∙ Lundius, E.G. ...

USA. 2014; 111 :11413-11418 Crossref Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Note that our mesh size estimation reflects an average obtained from ensemble measurements. DNA density is known to be spatially heterogeneous within individual nucleoids ( Le Gall et al., 2016 75. Le Gall, A. ∙ Cattoni, D.I. ∙ Guilhas, B. ... Bacterial partition complexes segregate within the volume of the nucleoid Nat.

Live-cell superresolution microscopy reveals the organization of RNA polymerase in the bacterial nucleoid Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112 :E4390-E4399 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), consistent with our poor solvent simulations ( Figure 3 ). We therefore expect the nucleoid to have a spectrum of mesh sizes with an average around 50 nm. We speculate that regions with smaller mesh sizes (i.e., more compacted DNA) represent regions that are less active in gene expression, while regions with larger mesh sizes (i.e., less compacted DNA) are more active. This is consistent with the negative correlation between ribosome and DNA densities at the nucleoid level ( Figure 5 ).
This study only used E. coli cells in exponential phase. Our method should provide a mean to examine different conditions (e.g., stationary phase and antibiotic exposure) in various bacteria, as long as probes of varying size (e.g., GFP-μNS) can be expressed. Our simulation approach offers high computational efficiency and effectively reproduces the scaling of polymer size at different length scales ( Figure S3 ; STAR Methods ) and the DNA density heterogeneity across the nucleoid ( Figure 3 ). However, it does not explicitly model the molecular forces among the monomers or interaction between distant monomers, which will be important to do in future work. In addition, we inferred the effective solvent quality of the cytoplasm for the chromosome by considering that the chromosome is a random coil polymer and the solvent is everything else in the cytoplasm. This simplification provides a macroscopic description of the cytoplasm that interconnect various aspects of cell and chromosome biology, from chromosome compaction ( Figure 6 ) and transcription ( Figure 7 ) to chromosome domain organization ( Figure 3 ) and intracellular organization ( Figures 2 , 4 , and 5 ). In reality, cells are far more complex than simple polymer solutions. The chromosome does not behave as simply as a random coiled polymer ( Hadizadeh Yazdi et al., 2012 51. Hadizadeh Yazdi, N. ∙ Guet, C.C. ∙ Johnson, R.C. ... Variation of the folding and dynamics of the Escherichia coli chromosome with growth conditions Mol. Microbiol. 2012; 86 :1318-1333 Crossref Scopus (91) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wiggins et al., 2010 154. Wiggins, P.A. ∙ Cheveralls, K.C. ∙ Martin, J.S. ... Strong intranucleoid interactions organize the Escherichia coli chromosome into a nucleoid filament Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107 :4991-4995 Crossref Scopus (134) PubMed Google Scholar ), in part due to enzymatic activity leading to DNA supercoiling ( Deng et al., 2005 41. Deng, S. ∙ Stein, R.A. ∙ Higgins, N.P. Organization of supercoil domains and their reorganization by transcription Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57 :1511-1521 Crossref Scopus (104) PubMed Google Scholar ; Postow et al., 2004 110. Postow, L. ∙ Hardy, C.D. ∙ Arsuaga, J. ... Topological domain structure of the Escherichia coli chromosome Genes Dev. 2004; 18 :1766-1779 Crossref Scopus (310) PubMed Google Scholar ). As mentioned above, the proposed poor solvent effects likely originate from interspersed and superimposed molecular interactions associated with the complex and active nature of the cytoplasm. Further experimental and theoretical work will be required to disentangle the contribution of each factor.

This study used the following published strains. MG1655 (F-lambda- ilvG - rfb -50 rph -1) was used as a wild-type E. coli strain ( Jensen, 1993 60. Jensen, K.F.

Bacteriol. 1993; 175 :3401-3407 Crossref Scopus (377) PubMed Google Scholar ). Strain CJW6324 (MG1655 seqA :: seqA-mcherry ftsZ :: ftsZ - venus SW ) was used to separate the E. coli cell population into three distinct groups that corresponded to the cells in the B, C and D periods ( Gray et al., 2019 49.

Nucleoid Size Scaling and Intracellular Organization of Translation across Bacteria Cell. 2019; 177 :1632-1648.e1620 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ). Strain CJW6340 (BL21 Star (DE3) pET29b+ I3-01-sfgfp) was obtained as a kind gift from David Baker’s laboratory at the University of Washington ( Hsia et al., 2016 58.

In this strain, the artificially designed protein I3-01 fused to superfolder GFP (I3-01(ctGFP)) was produced from the pET29b+ plasmid in BL21 Star (DE3) E. coli cells. I3-01(ctGFP) assembles into dodecahedron nanocage particles ( Hsia et al., 2016 58. Hsia, Y. ∙ Bale, J.B. ∙ Gonen, S. ... Design of a hyperstable 60-subunit protein dodecahedron. [corrected] Nature. 2016; 535 :136-139 Crossref Scopus (187) PubMed Google Scholar ). Strain CJW4617 (MG1655 Δ lacZYA :: gfp-μNS ) produces GFP-μNS particles of tunable sizes in response to IPTG induction ( Parry et al., 2014 101. Parry, B.R. ∙ Surovtsev, I.V. ∙ Cabeen, M.T. ... The bacterial cytoplasm has glass-like properties and is fluidized by metabolic activity Cell. 2014; 156 :183-194 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (370) PubMed Google Scholar ). Strain CJW7020 (MG1655 rplA :: rplA - msfgfp ) was used to investigate the pixel intensity correlation between DNA and ribosome fluorescence signals ( Gray et al., 2019 49. Gray, W.T. ∙ Govers, S.K. ∙ Xiang, Y. ... Nucleoid Size Scaling and Intracellular Organization of Translation across Bacteria Cell. 2019; 177 :1632-1648.e1620 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Strain CJW7324 (MG1655 rplA :: rplA - mcherry ), which was a kind gift from Dr. Alexandros Papagiannakis and Yashna Thappeta, was used to assess the impact of antibiotic treatments (Rif and Ksg) on the compaction of the nucleoid and the spatial pattern of the RNASelect signal.
Strain CJW7323 (MG1655 hupA :: hupA - mcherry rplA :: rplA - gfp ) was used in the time lapse experiment to visualize the nucleoid dynamics in cells on Ksg-containing agarose pads. The hupA - mcherry - frt - kanR - frt cassette was P1-transduced from CJW5158 (BW25113 hupA :: hupA - mcherry - frt - kanR - frt ) into CJW4677 (MG1655 rplA :: rplA - gfp ) ( Gray et al., 2019 49.

Nucleoid Size Scaling and Intracellular Organization of Translation across Bacteria Cell. 2019; 177 :1632-1648.e1620 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ), yielding strain CJW5159 (MG1655 hupA :: hupA - mcherry - frt - kanR - frt rplA :: rplA - gfp ). Strain CJW5159 was then transiently equipped with plasmid pCP20 expressing the Flp site-specific recombinase ( Cherepanov and Wackernagel, 1995 27. Cherepanov, P.P. ∙ Wackernagel, W. Gene disruption in Escherichia coli: TcR and KmR cassettes with the option of Flp-catalyzed excision of the antibiotic-resistance determinant Gene. 1995; 158 :9-14 Crossref Scopus (1285) PubMed Google Scholar ), which excised the kanamycin resistance cassette, yielding strain CJW7323.
Strain CJW6320 (MG1655 seqA :: seqA-mcherry-frt-cat-frt ) was constructed using E. coli K12 MG1655 as a parental strain. PCR amplification with oligonucleotides SG5 and SG6 ( Gray et al., 2019 49. Gray, W.T. ∙ Govers, S.K. ∙ Xiang, Y. ... Nucleoid Size Scaling and Intracellular Organization of Translation across Bacteria Cell. 2019; 177 :1632-1648.e1620 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ) was performed using pKD3-mCherry ( Gray et al., 2019 49. Gray, W.T. ∙ Govers, S.K. ∙ Xiang, Y. ... Nucleoid Size Scaling and Intracellular Organization of Translation across Bacteria Cell. 2019; 177 :1632-1648.e1620 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ) as a template to generate an mCherry -FRT- cat -FRT amplicon flanked by short (50 bp) nucleotide sequences homologous to their target regions (50 nt on both sides of the seqA stop codon). This amplicon was used to replace the stop codon of the native seqA gene, yielding a chromosomally encoded seqA-mcherry fusion.
Strain CJW7039 (MG1655 rplA :: rplA - msfgfp seqA :: seqA - mcherry ) was used to compare the SCF between DAPI and RplA-msfGFP signals among untreated E. coli cells in the B, C, D periods. Using P1 lysate prepared from CJW6320 (MG1655 seqA :: seqA - mcherry - frt - cat - frt ), seqA - mcherry - frt - cat - frt was introduced into CJW7020 (MG1655 rplA :: rplA - msfgfp ) ( Gray et al., 2019 49. Gray, W.T. ∙ Govers, S.K. ∙ Xiang, Y. ... Nucleoid Size Scaling and Intracellular Organization of Translation across Bacteria Cell. 2019; 177 :1632-1648.e1620 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ). This strain was then transiently equipped with plasmid pCP20 expressing the Flp site-specific recombinase, which excised the chloramphenicol resistance cassette ( Cherepanov and Wackernagel, 1995 27. Cherepanov, P.P. ∙ Wackernagel, W. Gene disruption in Escherichia coli: TcR and KmR cassettes with the option of Flp-catalyzed excision of the antibiotic-resistance determinant Gene. 1995; 158 :9-14 Crossref Scopus (1285) PubMed Google Scholar ), resulting in strain CJW7039.
To obtain steady-state growth conditions, a sample of an overnight liquid cell culture in stationary phase was diluted by a factor of at least 10,000 in the corresponding fresh growth medium (see below for the composition of the growth medium used for each experiment). The culture was then allowed to grow in an incubator shaker (New Brunswick Innova 44), at the indicated temperature, to reach an optical density at 600 nm (OD 600 ) of 0.1-0.3 prior to microscopy. Details about growth conditions are described for each method section below.
Unless otherwise specified, all exponentially growing cells were imaged on 1% agarose pads supplemented with growth medium. When appropriate, cultures were incubated with 1 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for 15 min in growth medium prior to imaging on agarose pads. Phase contrast and epifluorescence imaging were performed on a Nikon Eclipse Ti-E microscope equipped with a phase contrast Nikon CFI Plan Apo DM Lambda 100x oil objective (NA = 1.45), and a SOLA light engine (Lumencor). A Ph3 phase contrast ring was used. The following Chroma filters were used for epifluorescence imaging: DAPI (excitation D390/22x, dichroic T425lpxr, emission ET460/50 m), GFP (excitation ET470/40x, dichroic T495lpxr, emission ET525/50 m), mCherry/TexasRed (excitation ET560/40x, dichroic T585lp, emission ET630/75 m). The microscope was controlled by the NIS-Elements AR software.
Using the open source software Oufti ( Paintdakhi et al., 2016 100. Paintdakhi, A. ∙ Parry, B. ∙ Campos, M. ... Oufti: an integrated software package for high-accuracy, high-throughput quantitative microscopy analysis Mol. Microbiol. 2016; 99 :767-777 Crossref Scopus (146) PubMed Google Scholar ), cell and nucleoid outlines were constructed based on the phase contrast and epifluorescence (e.g., DAPI) images, respectively. When appropriate, cells were classified into the B, C and D cell-cycle periods based on two cell features: SeqA-mCherry pattern and cell area, as described before ( Gray et al., 2019 49.

GFP-tagged nanocage particles were produced through basal expression of the GFP-tagged protein subunit I3-01 in E. coli cells (CJW6340) grown at 30°C in M9 minimal medium supplemented with glycerol (0.2%), casamino acids (0.1%) and thiamine (1 μg/ml). Phase contrast images were taken first to define cell outlines. Time-lapse fluorescence images were then acquired at a frame rate of 100 ms. Nanocage particles were localized and tracked using the MATLAB class SPT (see supplementary code). Briefly, an image was first smoothed by a band-pass filter. Potential regions containing the particles were then segmented based on an intensity threshold. Based on the region sizes, background noise pixels or particle clusters were filtered out. Within each of the remaining segmented regions, the brightest pixel was located. On the brightest pixel and its eight surrounding pixels, the pixel intensities were fitted by a 2D Gaussian distribution, whose center was taken as the estimated particle position. The particle locations were linked into trajectories using an algorithm described previously ( Crocker and Grier, 1996 33. Crocker, J.C. ∙ Grier, D.G. Methods of Digital Video Microscopy for Colloidal Studies J. Colloid Interface Sci. 1996; 179 :298-310 Crossref Scopus (2486) Google Scholar ). The 2D mean squared displacements (MSD) plot were calculated as 𝑀 ⁢ 𝑆 ⁢ 𝐷 ⁡ ( 𝜏 ) = < ( 𝑟 ⁡ ( 𝑡 + 𝜏 ) − 𝑟 ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) ) 2 > , where 𝜏 is a given time delay and 𝑟 ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) and 𝑟 ⁢ ( 𝑡 + 𝜏 ) denote the particle positions before and after the given time delay. Similarly, GFP-μNS particles were produced through IPTG induction (50-200 μM) for a duration of 30-120 min, in E. coli cells (CJW4617) grown at 30°C in M9 minimal medium supplemented with glycerol (0.2%), casamino acids (0.1%) and thiamine (1 μg/ml). GFP-μNS particles were detected using SpotFinder ( Sliusarenko et al., 2011 130. Sliusarenko, O. ∙ Heinritz, J. ∙ Emonet, T. ... High-throughput, subpixel precision analysis of bacterial morphogenesis and intracellular spatio-temporal dynamics Mol. Microbiol. 2011; 80 :612-627 Crossref Scopus (340) PubMed Google Scholar ). Particle positions of both nanocage-GFP and GFP-μNS particles relative to the cell coordinates were calculated using the function projectToMesh in Oufti and normalized by cell width and length. The relative particle positions were used to generate histograms to demonstrate the probability density of relative particle locations inside the cell.
The entire E. coli chromosome (4.6 million base pairs, contour length = 1564 μm) was modeled as a freely-jointed phantom chain (zero volume, no self-avoidance) of 26,066 segments, each of which had a length of 60 nm (to reflect the estimated Kuhn length). In each simulation instance, the first segment of the chromosome was constructed by linking the origin (x = 0, y = 0, z = 0) and a random point radially a Kuhn-length (i.e., 60 nm) away. Similarly, the remaining segments were constructed iteratively by linking the current end of the chromosome chain with another randomly sampled point that was radially a Kuhn-length away. The solvent quality was modeled by the constraint on the range of angles between consecutive segments. In the ideal-solvent case, there was no restriction on the inter-segmental angles ( 𝜃 ) , as there was no preference for a segment to interact with other parts of the polymer or the solvent. Meanwhile, for a polymer in a poor or good solvent, the segments on the polymer chain was set to ‘prefer’ interacting among themselves (poor solvent) or with the solvent (good solvent). To model the attraction and repulsion, restrictions were applied to the range of possible 𝜃 . By verifying the power-law scaling between the number of segments and the radius of gyration of the simulated chromosomes, the 𝜃 was constrained within empirically determined ranges ( Figure S3 B). Specifically, we found that the Flory exponents (0.36 and 0.58) could be achieved when the inter-segmental angles were constrained to be greater than 11π/18 and smaller than π/2, respectively. A limitation of our simulation scheme is that it does not explicitly model the molecular forces among the monomers and only considers interaction between adjacent monomers. However, it is computationally efficient for modeling a large polymer like the bacterial chromosome and effectively reproduces the scaling of polymer size at two length scales. Specifically, at small length scales, the conformation (and thus 𝑅 𝑔 ) of a small section of the polymer chain in a semidilute solution behaves similarly to that in a dilute solution at a given solvent quality ( Figure S3 B), as monomers are surrounded mostly by the solvent at small length scales ( Rubinstein, 2003 118. Rubinstein, M. Polymer physics Colby, R.H. (Editor) Oxford University Press, 2003 Crossref Google Scholar ). At larger length scales ( Figure S3 B, inset), interactions between distant monomers become screened and the polymer behaves as a random walk, leading to a scaling exponent of 0.50 regardless of the solvent quality ( Rubinstein, 2003 118. Rubinstein, M. Polymer physics Colby, R.H. (Editor) Oxford University Press, 2003 Crossref Google Scholar ).
In order to compare the degree of chromosome compaction as a result of different types of solvent, the E. coli chromosome was simulated in free space 1,000 times for each type of the solvent. The radius of gyration of each simulated chromosome was calculated as 𝑅 2 𝑔 = 1 𝑁 ⁢ ∑ 𝑁 𝑖 ( 𝑟 𝑖 − 𝑟 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑛 ) 2 , where 𝑅 𝑔 is the radius of gyration, 𝑟 𝑖 is position of 𝑖 -th segment, 𝑟 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑛 is the average position of all segments and 𝑁 is the total number of segments. Given a fixed contour length, the geometric constraint of being circular forces the chromosome to adopt a smaller average size compared to that of a linear chain. Quantitatively, the average radius of gyration of a circular polymer is a factor of √ 2 smaller than that of its linear counterpart ( Casassa, 1965 23. Casassa, E.F. Some statistical properties of flexible ring polymers J. Polym. Sci. A1. 1965; 3 :605-614 Google Scholar ; Kramers, 1946 69. Kramers, H.A. The Behavior of Macromolecules in Inhomogeneous Flow J. Chem. Phys. 1946; 14 :415-424 Crossref Google Scholar ; Rubinstein, 2003 118. Rubinstein, M. Polymer physics Colby, R.H. (Editor) Oxford University Press, 2003 Crossref Google Scholar ; Zimm and Stockmayer, 1949 171. Zimm, B.H. ∙ Stockmayer, W.H. The Dimensions of Chain Molecules Containing Branches and Rings J. Chem. Phys. 1949; 17 :1301-1314 Crossref Google Scholar ). Therefore, to account for the circular geometry of the E. coli chromosome, 𝑅 𝑔 was divided by a factor of √ 2 to get 𝑅 ′ 𝑔 . The volume of the simulated nucleoid in each type of solvent was calculated as 𝑉 = 4 3 ⁢ 𝜋 ⁢ ( 𝑅 ′ 𝑔 ) 3 .
To examine chromosome conformation across solvents under the experimentally determined average DNA concentration within the nucleoid region ( Figures 3 , S7 A, and S7B), we performed the simulations described above, except that the entire chromosome chain was confined within a spherocylindrical space with a volume (0.70 μm 3 ) equal to the experimentally observed average nucleoid volume in B-period cells.
To model the DNA relaxation at the domain boundary in a poor solvent ( Figure S7 D), the restriction on 𝜃 was altered to a different range among a number ( 𝑛 ) of DNA segments surrounding the 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-Mb coordinates of the chromosome during simulation. The variables 𝜃 and 𝑛 therefore set the degree and length ( 𝐿 ) of the DNA relaxation, respectively.
E. coli wild-type cells (MG1655) were grown at 37°C in M9 minimal medium supplemented with glucose (0.2%), casamino acids (0.1%) and thiamine (1 μg/ml). Nutrient-rich growth conditions were chosen over nutrient-poor condition to increase the intracellular concentration of ribosomes ( Dai et al., 2016 35. Dai, X. ∙ Zhu, M. ∙ Warren, M. ...

Exponentially growing cells were then harvested and concentrated between 30- and 150-fold by centrifugation (6,000 g for 5 min). The concentrated culture sample was deposited onto freshly glow-discharged QUANTIFOIL holey carbon grids (Electron Microscopy Sciences). The grids were then blotted with the filter paper for ∼3-5 s before getting plunge-frozen into liquid ethane, using a custom gravity-driven plunger apparatus described previously ( Liu et al., 2009 81.

Cryoelectron tomography reveals the sequential assembly of bacterial flagella in Borrelia burgdorferi Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110 :14390-14395 Crossref Scopus (65) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The plunge-frozen grids were clipped into cryo-FIB AutoGrids and mounted into the specimen shuttle under liquid nitrogen. An Aquilos cryo-FIB system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to mill the samples to produce thin lamellae. The samples were first sputter-coated with Pt (1 kV, 15 mA, 15 s) to improve the overall sample conductivity, and then were deposited by an organometallic Pt layer (4-5 μm thick) using the gas injection system for the sample protection. Lamellae were produced using the gallium ion beam at 30 kV with stage tilt angle around 17°. The ion beam current was reduced according to the lamella thickness (t) during the milling process: 0.5 nA for t ≥ 3 μm, 0.3 nA for t ≥ 1 μm, 0.1 nA for t ≥ 700 nm, 0.05/0.03 nA for final polishing. Afterward, a thin Pt layer was sputter-coated (1 kV, 10 mA, 5 s) on the lamella to prevent possible charging issue during the cryo-ET imaging.
The cryo-FIB lamellae were transferred to a 300 kV Titan Krios electron microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with a Direct Electron Detector and energy filter (Gatan). The program SerialEM ( Mastronarde, 2005 90. Mastronarde, D.N. Automated electron microscope tomography using robust prediction of specimen movements J. Struct. Biol. 2005; 152 :36-51 Crossref Scopus (1782) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used to collect single-axis tilt series around −6 μm defocus, with a cumulative dose of ∼100 e - /Å covering angles from −60° to 60° (2° tilt step). Images were acquired at 26,000 × magnification with an effective pixel size of 5.457 Å at the specimen level. All recorded images were first drift corrected by the software MotionCor2 ( Zheng et al., 2017 169. Zheng, S.Q. ∙ Palovcak, E. ∙ Armache, J.P. ... MotionCor2: anisotropic correction of beam-induced motion for improved cryo-electron microscopy Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :331-332 Crossref Scopus (1982) PubMed Google Scholar ) and then stacked by the software package IMOD ( Kremer et al., 1996 70. Kremer, J.R. ∙ Mastronarde, D.N. ∙ McIntosh, J.R. Computer visualization of three-dimensional image data using IMOD J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116 :71-76 Crossref Scopus (3066) PubMed Google Scholar ). All tilt series were then aligned by IMOD with the patching tracking method. The program Gctf ( Zhang, 2016 166. Zhang, K. Gctf: Real-time CTF determination and correction J. Struct. Biol. 2016; 193 :1-12 Crossref Scopus (1297) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used to determine the defocus of each tilt image in the aligned stacks, and the function “ctfphaseflip” in IMOD was used to perform the contrast transfer function (CTF) correction for the tilt images. Tomograms were then reconstructed in IMOD using the CTF-corrected and aligned stacks. In total, we collected 11 tomograms and selected those that have the following two characteristics: 1) a cell-like shape (i.e., the lamella spans the length of the cell), and 2) least amount of iced dirt and crystalline ice.
E. coli cells (CJW7324) were grown at 37°C in M9 minimal medium supplemented with glycerol (0.2%), casamino acids (0.1%) and thiamine (1 μg/ml). Exponentially growing cells were stained with SYTO RNASelect (Invitrogen) with a final concentration of 500 nM for 15 min. SYTO RNASelect was shown to bind more specifically to the RNA ( Chong et al., 2014 28. Chong, S. ∙ Chen, C. ∙ Ge, H. ... Mechanism of transcriptional bursting in bacteria Cell. 2014; 158 :314-326 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (199) PubMed Google Scholar ), even in the presence of DNA ( Kannemeier et al., 2007 66. Kannemeier, C. ∙ Shibamiya, A. ∙ Nakazawa, F. ... Extracellular RNA constitutes a natural procoagulant cofactor in blood coagulation Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104 :6388-6393 Crossref Scopus (369) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cells were incubated with SYTO RNASelect prior to the addition of Rif (300 μg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich) and Ksg (5 mg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich) to separate cultures because no cell staining was observed when RNASelect was added after drug treatment, presumably due to a change in membrane permeability for the dye. Our RNASelect staining protocol did not significantly affect the NC ratios, as shown in control experiments ( Figure S6 C). The antibiotic concentrations were selected to match the concentrations used in a previous study ( Bakshi et al., 2014 7. Bakshi, S. ∙ Choi, H. ∙ Mondal, J. ... Time-dependent effects of transcription- and translation-halting drugs on the spatial distributions of the Escherichia coli chromosome and ribosomes Mol. Microbiol. 2014; 94 :871-887 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ). The nucleoid was stained with DAPI for 15 min prior to imaging.
E. coli cells (CJW7323) were grown at 37°C in M9 minimal medium supplemented with glycerol (0.2%), casamino acids (0.1%), thiamine (1 μg/ml). Exponentially growing cells were spotted onto the agarose pad containing 5 mg/ml Ksg in addition to the growth medium, and images were taken with neutral-density filters every minute.
Cell characteristics (cell size, nucleoid size, fluorescence signal intensities etc.) were obtained by analyzing phase and fluorescence images using the software package Oufti ( Paintdakhi et al., 2016 100. Paintdakhi, A. ∙ Parry, B. ∙ Campos, M. ... Oufti: an integrated software package for high-accuracy, high-throughput quantitative microscopy analysis Mol. Microbiol. 2016; 99 :767-777 Crossref Scopus (146) PubMed Google Scholar ) and further processed in MATLAB. All sample statistics (e.g., mean, standard deviation) were also calculated in MATLAB using built functions mean and std.
Correlation coefficients (Spearman’s 𝜌 ) between variables (i.e., DAPI pixel intensity versus GFP pixel intensity, NC ratio versus RNASelect fluorescence density) were calculated using the built-in MATLAB function corr.
The Kuhn length of a polymer, 𝑏 , is equivalent to twice its persistence length, which is a measure of rigidity. DNA is a semiflexible polymer. Its rigidity stems from base stacking interactions within the DNA duplex and electrostatic repulsion among phosphate groups in the DNA backbone. The persistence length of the DNA is often assumed to be 50 nm (i.e., Kuhn length 𝑏 = 100 nm). However, in vitro measurements of DNA rigidity indicate that the presence of multivalent cations, including Mg 2+ , the most abundant divalent cation in E. coli ( Alatossava et al., 1985 2.

E. coli strain CJW6324 was grown at 37°C in M9 minimal medium supplemented with glycerol (0.2%). To estimate the average DNA concentration within the nucleoid regions, B-period cells (with a single chromosome) were first identified using a method based on cell size and the localization of the SeqA DNA replication marker ( Gray et al., 2019 49.

In contrast, SeqA-mCherry displays a diffuse distribution in cells before and after DNA replication (i.e., during B and D periods, respectively) ( Figure 1 B). We used these changes in spatial distribution of SeqA-mCherry signal and the knowledge that cells grow in size during the cell cycle to classify cells by cell-cycle period ( Figure 1 C). Once cells with a single chromosome were identified, we calculated their DNA mass. Given that the average molecular weight of a nucleotide base pair is 650 g/mol ( Lee et al., 2012 76.

Blattner, F.R. ∙ Plunkett, 3rd, G. ∙ Bloch, C.A. ... The complete genome sequence of Escherichia coli K-12 Science. 1997; 277 :1453-1462 Crossref Scopus (5721) PubMed Google Scholar ), the total DNA mass in a single chromosome is around 5 femtograms. The nucleoid volume was estimated as 𝑉 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑑 = 𝑉 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ ( 𝐴 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑑 / 𝐴 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑙 ) 3 / 2 , where 𝑉 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑑 , 𝑉 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑙 , 𝐴 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑑 , 𝐴 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑙 are the volume and cross-sectional area of the nucleoid and cell. The cell volume was calculated by accumulating the volume of cylindrical slices along the cell center line. Each cylindrical slice was defined by the rotation of consecutive pairs of points in the cell outlines constructed by the Oufti software ( Paintdakhi et al., 2016 100. Paintdakhi, A. ∙ Parry, B. ∙ Campos, M. ... Oufti: an integrated software package for high-accuracy, high-throughput quantitative microscopy analysis Mol. Microbiol. 2016; 99 :767-777 Crossref Scopus (146) PubMed Google Scholar ). To construct the nucleoid outlines, Oufti first convolves the background-subtracted fluorescence image with a Laplacian of Gaussian. The convolution product was up-sampled using a cubic spline. The up-sampled pixels with zero-crossing components are then connected to form polygons that define the nucleoid contours ( Paintdakhi et al., 2016 100. Paintdakhi, A. ∙ Parry, B. ∙ Campos, M. ... Oufti: an integrated software package for high-accuracy, high-throughput quantitative microscopy analysis Mol. Microbiol. 2016; 99 :767-777 Crossref Scopus (146) PubMed Google Scholar ). The nucleoid and cell areas were calculated by summing up the areas of the polygons defined by the nucleoid and cell outlines. The power 3/2 was used to convert the estimated nucleoid area fraction into a volume fraction. The nucleoid volume estimation was performed at the single-cell level, as was the DNA concentration calculation, which was simply a division between the estimated DNA mass and the nucleoid volume. Note that the exclusion of the largest GFP-μNS probes (150 nm) from the nucleoid gave us an independent method to estimate the nucleocytoplasmic (NC) ratio ( 𝐴 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑑 / 𝐴 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑙 ) . Based on the cumulative distribution function of the GFP-μNS localizations, cell regions with the highest 30% localization density was considered as the cell pole and periphery. The total area of these regions was subtracted from the cell area to obtain the estimated nucleoid area. Using this method, we estimated that NC ratio = 0.67, which is close to the value obtained when the nucleoid area is defined by the Oufti outline of the DAPI staining of the cell. To verify that B-period cells are transcriptionally active, we used a strain (CJW7039) in which ribosomes are fluorescently labeled. CJW7039 cells were grown at 37°C in M9 minimal medium supplemented with glycerol (0.2%). Following DAPI staining and imaging, we did not see any large differences in nucleoid exclusion for ribosomes between cells in B, C and D periods as shown by the strongly overlapping distribution of the SCF values between nucleoid and ribosomes ( Figure S1 C). The SCF measures the pixel correlation between signals of fluorescently labeled nucleoid and ribosomes ( Gray et al., 2019 49. Gray, W.T. ∙ Govers, S.K. ∙ Xiang, Y. ... Nucleoid Size Scaling and Intracellular Organization of Translation across Bacteria Cell. 2019; 177 :1632-1648.e1620 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ). Positive values represent mixing between the DNA and ribosomes, and negative values indicate that ribosomes are enriched outside the nucleoid. The fact that the SCF values in B-period cells are primarily negative indicates that polysomes are present and thus that transcription is ongoing. If transcription was not ongoing, the SCF values would be positive, as observed when transcription is inhibited by rifampicin ( Figure S1 C).
Bulk studies using the diphenylamine colorimetric assay and cell counting reported that the average DNA mass per cell under nutrient-rich conditions, glucose, glucose plus casamino acids and rich defined medium plus glucose as carbon sources, were around 10, 14 and 30 fg, respectively ( Basan et al., 2015 8. Basan, M. ∙ Zhu, M. ∙ Dai, X. ... Inflating bacterial cells by increased protein synthesis Mol. Syst. Biol. 2015; 11 :836 Crossref Scopus (69) PubMed Google Scholar ). The average cell sizes among these growth conditions (i.e., 2.32, 3.33, 6.60 μm 3 , respectively) were also shown to scale linearly with the average DNA mass per cell ( Basan et al., 2015 8. Basan, M. ∙ Zhu, M. ∙ Dai, X. ... Inflating bacterial cells by increased protein synthesis Mol. Syst. Biol. 2015; 11 :836 Crossref Scopus (69) PubMed Google Scholar ). Taking into consideration of the strong scaling between the nucleoid size and cell size ( Gray et al., 2019 49. Gray, W.T. ∙ Govers, S.K. ∙ Xiang, Y. ... Nucleoid Size Scaling and Intracellular Organization of Translation across Bacteria Cell. 2019; 177 :1632-1648.e1620 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ), we estimated the average DNA concentration within the nucleoid to be 7.3, 7.1 and 7.7 mg/ml under these three nutrient-rich growth conditions. Therefore, when taken together, the DNA concentration within the nucleoid among these nutrient-rich conditions is 7.4 ± 0.2 mg/ml.
The size estimation of the GFP- μNS particles was performed as previously described ( Parry et al., 2014 101. Parry, B.R. ∙ Surovtsev, I.V. ∙ Cabeen, M.T. ... The bacterial cytoplasm has glass-like properties and is fluidized by metabolic activity Cell. 2014; 156 :183-194 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (370) PubMed Google Scholar ). This method establishes a relation between the fluorescence intensity ( 𝐼 ) of GFP-μNS particles and their absolute sizes ( 𝑑 ) . The particle fluorescence intensity ( 𝐼 ) was calculated by integrating the volume of the fitting 2D Gaussian distribution that was used to determine the particle location: 𝐼 = 2 ⁢ 𝜋 ⁢ 𝐴 ⁢ 𝜎 2 , where 𝐴 and 𝜎 are the height and width of the fitting distribution, respectively ( Sliusarenko et al., 2011 130. Sliusarenko, O. ∙ Heinritz, J. ∙ Emonet, T. ... High-throughput, subpixel precision analysis of bacterial morphogenesis and intracellular spatio-temporal dynamics Mol. Microbiol. 2011; 80 :612-627 Crossref Scopus (340) PubMed Google Scholar ). Assuming the total fluorescence intensity of a particle is proportional to its volume, and the volume is a cubic function of its size (e.g., for a sphere), we further calculated the cubic root of the fluorescence intensity: 3 √ 𝐼 .
The absolute sizes of GFP-μNS particles were estimated as previously described ( Parry et al., 2014 101. Parry, B.R. ∙ Surovtsev, I.V. ∙ Cabeen, M.T. ... The bacterial cytoplasm has glass-like properties and is fluidized by metabolic activity Cell. 2014; 156 :183-194 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (370) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, cells expressing GFP-μNS were lysed with T7 phages, resulting in the release of the GFP-μNS particles in solution. Cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 4,000 g. Released GFP-μNS particles were then mixed with fluorescent microspheres of known nominal size (110 nm, FluoSpheres F8803, Invitrogen), and their diffusion coefficients were determined using single particle tracking microscopy. We defined the fluorescence-derived relative particle size 𝑑 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑙 = 3 √ 𝐼 / 𝐼 𝑓 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑜 for the GFP-μNS particles, where 𝐼 𝑓 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑜 denotes the average fluorescence intensity of the fluorescent microspheres. Based on the Stokes-Einstein equation, the relative particle size and the corresponding diffusion coefficient is inversely proportional: 𝐷 = 𝑘 ⁢ 𝑇 / ( 3 ⁢ 𝜋 ⁢ 𝜂 ⁢ 𝑑 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑙 ) , where 𝑘 is the Boltzmann constant, 𝑇 is the absolute temperature, and 𝜂 is the viscosity of the solution. The absolute sizes of the GFP-μNS particles were estimated as 𝑑 = 𝑑 𝑓 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝐷 𝑓 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝛼 / 𝐷 , where 𝑑 𝑓 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑜 = 110 nm and 𝛼 = 𝑑 / 𝑑 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑙 is a calibration constant, which was found to be 685 nm.
To construct the probability density maps of nanocage-GFP particle positions, we first calculated the particle positions (n = 2,500) relative to the cell outlines. All relative particle positions were then aggregated together and plotted as a normalized 2D histogram. For GFP-μNS particles, the particle positions (n = 133,692) were first grouped together (i.e., binned) based on the corresponding estimated particle sizes. For a given group of positions obtained from particles of similar estimated sizes, we calculated the relative positions to the cell outlines. For each group, we then plotted the particle positions as a normalized 2D histogram, representing a probability density map of the positions.
Based on the cumulative distribution function of the GFP-μNS localizations in the bin of the largest particle size (150 nm), cell regions with the highest 30% localization density was assumed to be the non-nucleoid region (i.e., the cell pole and periphery), and the rest was assumed to be the nucleoid region. The average probability density of localizing the nanocage-GFP and GFP-μNS particles of different sizes within ( 𝑓 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 ) and outside ( 𝑓 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑡 ) the assumed nucleoid regions were calculated. The exclusion score was calculated as 1 − ( 𝑓 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 / 𝑓 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑡 ) .
E. coli cells (CJW7020) were grown at 37°C in M9 minimal medium supplemented with glucose (0.2%), casamino acids (0.1%) and thiamine (1 μg/ml). The nucleoid was visualized through DAPI straining. Fluorescence signals from DAPI and L1-msfGFP were acquired. The nucleoid outlines were constructed using objectDetection in the software package Oufti ( Paintdakhi et al., 2016 100. Paintdakhi, A. ∙ Parry, B. ∙ Campos, M. ... Oufti: an integrated software package for high-accuracy, high-throughput quantitative microscopy analysis Mol. Microbiol. 2016; 99 :767-777 Crossref Scopus (146) PubMed Google Scholar ). In order to exclusively quantify the pixel intensity correlation within the nucleoid region, the nucleoid outlines were shrunk by 2 pixels from the original boundaries using the built-in MATLAB function polybuffer. The shrunk nucleoid outlines enclosed, on average, about 30% of the inner most pixels defined by the original outlines. Image masks were constructed using the shrunk nucleoid outlines, and pixels from both the DAPI and GFP images were extracted. Correlation scores (Spearman’s 𝜌 ) were then calculated between the intensities of DAPI and GFP pixels using the built-in MATLAB function corr.
The signal profiles of DAPI were calculated for individual cells using the software package Oufti ( Paintdakhi et al., 2016 100. Paintdakhi, A. ∙ Parry, B. ∙ Campos, M. ... Oufti: an integrated software package for high-accuracy, high-throughput quantitative microscopy analysis Mol. Microbiol. 2016; 99 :767-777 Crossref Scopus (146) PubMed Google Scholar ). For each cell, the DAPI signal profile was normalized as 𝐼 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑚 = ( 𝐼 − 𝐼 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 ) / ( 𝐼 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑥 − 𝐼 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 ) , where 𝐼 , 𝐼 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑚 , 𝐼 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 , and 𝐼 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑥 are the raw, normalized, minimum and maximum values of the signal, respectively. The normalized signal profiles were further interpolated linearly using the built-in MATLAB function interp1 to obtain a fixed signal profile length. The signal profiles then sorted based on the corresponding cell length. All signal profiles were then concatenated to construct the final demograph plots.
The simulation of chromosomes was implemented and quantified in Python 3.6, with the additional libraries NumPy ( Harris et al., 2020 52. Harris, C.R. ∙ Millman, K.J. ∙ van der Walt, S.J. ... Array programming with NumPy Nature. 2020; 585 :357-362 Crossref Scopus (800) PubMed Google Scholar ), SciPy ( Virtanen et al., 2020 147. Virtanen, P. ∙ Gommers, R. ∙ Oliphant, T.E. ..., SciPy 1.0 Contributors SciPy 1.0: fundamental algorithms for scientific computing in Python Nat. Methods. 2020; 17 :261-272 Crossref Scopus (3027) PubMed Google Scholar ), Matplotlib ( Hunter, 2007 59. Hunter, J.D. Matplotlib: A 2D Graphics Environment Comput. Sci. Eng. 2007; 9 :90-95 Crossref Scopus (9418) Google Scholar ) and pandas ( McKinney, 2010 91. McKinney, W. Data Structures for Statistical Computing in Python Proceedings of the 9th Python in Science Conference. 2010; Crossref Google Scholar ). Specifically, the simulation was implemented using base functions in Python 3.6 and NumPy library. SciPy and pandas were used to analyze all simulations and provide the corresponding statistics (e.g., confidence interval, mean radius of gyration) relevant to the simulated chromosomes. Matplotlib was used to graph the simulated chromosome data.
The simulated chromosomes were binned by approximately 10 kb (56 DNA segments), and the average positions of the segments within each bin were calculated. The binning was applied to reduce the computational complexity of calculating the pair distance between DNA segments by more than three orders of magnitude. A matrix of pair distances, where the 𝑖 -th row and 𝑗 -th column represent the Euclidean distance between the 𝑖 -th and 𝑗 -th bins, was constructed for every simulated chromosome (obtained from independent simulation runs). A chosen number (10, 100 or 1000) of such matrices were averaged together to generate distance maps representing the average pair distances between the binned segments, which were then visualized as images in which the individual pixels correspond to the distances.
The software package emClarity ( Himes and Zhang, 2018 56. Himes, B.A. ∙ Zhang, P. emClarity: software for high-resolution cryo-electron tomography and subtomogram averaging Nat. Methods. 2018; 15 :955-961 Crossref Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used to perform the 3D template search to identify ribosomes from the tomograms. A low-pass filtered (∼4-nm resolution) E. coli 70S ribosome structure ( Fu et al., 2019 47. Fu, Z. ∙ Indrisiunaite, G. ∙ Kaledhonkar, S. ... The structural basis for release-factor activation during translation termination revealed by time-resolved cryogenic electron microscopy Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :2579 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used as a reference for the template search ( Figure S4 C). Initially, up to 15,000-20,000 sub-tomograms were initially selected from each tomogram. Subsequently, the sub-tomograms (80 × 80 × 80 voxel) were extracted from the CTF-corrected tomograms with no binning and the 3D classification and alignment were applied to all sub-tomograms by the software package i3 ( Winkler, 2007 155. Winkler, H. 3D reconstruction and processing of volumetric data in cryo-electron tomography J. Struct. Biol. 2007; 157 :126-137 Crossref Scopus (98) PubMed Google Scholar ; Winkler et al., 2009 156. Winkler, H. ∙ Zhu, P. ∙ Liu, J. ... Tomographic subvolume alignment and subvolume classification applied to myosin V and SIV envelope spikes J. Struct. Biol. 2009; 165 :64-77 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar ) with no binning. Sub-tomograms of the particles in the false class were removed ( Figure S4 D). After that, for every pair of localized structures, the separation distance between their center mass was calculated. Two structures in a pair were considered duplicates, if the distance between their centers of mass was smaller than 20 nm, and the structure that had a lower cross-correlation score with the global average structure was removed. This process repeated itself until no duplicate structure was found. The program UCSF ChimeraX ( Goddard et al., 2018 48. Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ∙ Meng, E.C. ... UCSF ChimeraX: Meeting modern challenges in visualization and analysis Protein Sci. 2018; 27 :14-25 Crossref Scopus (840) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used for the 3D surface rendering of subtomogram average structure of ribosome ( Figure 4 C; Video S4 ). The accuracy of the localization of ribosomes was verified by both visual inspection and comparison of the average structure obtained from the localized ribosomes to the reference structure. Ribosome statistics for each analyzed lamella are provided in Figure S5 A.
The information on ribosome positions and orientations generated by i3 from the previous localization steps were first transferred to RELION ( Bharat and Scheres, 2016 11. Bharat, T.A. ∙ Scheres, S.H. Resolving macromolecular structures from electron cryo-tomography data using subtomogram averaging in RELION Nat. Protoc. 2016; 11 :2054-2065 Crossref Scopus (72) PubMed Google Scholar ). All sub-tomograms were re-extracted from the CTF-corrected tomograms with a larger size (200 × 200 × 200 voxel) to include the potential neighboring ribosomes. The CTF volumes in RELION were used for missing wedge compensation and dose weighting, but no phase flip. A spherical mask with ∼80 nm diameter was used for the 3D classification. The polyribosome classes were sorted out after ∼20 iterations of classification.
This study did not generate any additional resources.
