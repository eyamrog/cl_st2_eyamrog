Title: In vivo CRISPR screening reveals nutrient signaling processes underpinning CD8 + T cell fate decisions


Abstract: Summary

How early events in effector T cell (T EFF ) subsets tune memory T cell (T MEM ) responses remains incompletely understood. Here, we systematically investigated metabolic factors in fate determination of T EFF and T MEM cells using in vivo pooled CRISPR screening, focusing on negative regulators of T MEM responses. We found that amino acid transporters Slc7a1 and Slc38a2 dampened the magnitude of T MEM differentiation, in part through modulating mTORC1 signaling. By integrating genetic and systems approaches, we identified cellular and metabolic heterogeneity among T EFF cells, with terminal effector differentiation associated with establishment of metabolic quiescence and exit from the cell cycle. Importantly, Pofut1 (protein-O-fucosyltransferase-1) linked GDP-fucose availability to downstream Notch-Rbpj signaling, and perturbation of this nutrient signaling axis blocked terminal effector differentiation but drove context-dependent T EFF proliferation and T MEM development. Our study establishes that nutrient uptake and signaling are key determinants of T cell fate and shape the quantity and quality of T MEM responses.

Section: Introduction

CD8 + T cells are critical for adaptive immune responses to pathogens and tumors. CD8 + T cell immunity is dependent on the differentiation into effector (T EFF ) and memory (T MEM ) cells, with both effector function and longevity important for success of T cell-mediated immunotherapies ( Crompton et al., 2014 15. Crompton, J.G. ∙ Sukumar, M. ∙ Restifo, N.P. Uncoupling T-cell expansion from effector differentiation in cell-based immunotherapy Immunol. Rev. 2014; 257 :264-276 Crossref Scopus (105) PubMed Google Scholar ). T EFF cells are divided into two distinct subsets: short-lived effector or terminal effector cells (TE; KLRG1 + CD127 − or KLRG1 hi CD127 lo ) and memory precursor cells (MP; KLRG1 − CD127 + or KLRG1 lo CD127 hi ) ( Joshi et al., 2007 35.

Omilusik, K.D. ∙ Goldrath, A.W. Remembering to remember: T cell memory maintenance and plasticity Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2019; 58 :89-97 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ). TE cells undergo terminal differentiation followed by cell death after the resolution of infection, whereas the MP subset preserves the survival fitness to become long-lived T MEM cells ( Joshi et al., 2007 35. Joshi, N.S. ∙ Cui, W. ∙ Chandele, A. ...

Selective expression of the interleukin 7 receptor identifies effector CD8 T cells that give rise to long-lived memory cells Nat Immunol. 2003; 4 :1191-1198 Crossref Scopus (1514) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, certain KLRG1 + cells persist following the resolution of infection, lose KLRG1 expression, and become T MEM cells ( Herndler-Brandstetter et al., 2018 29. Herndler-Brandstetter, D. ∙ Ishigame, H. ∙ Shinnakasu, R. ...

T MEM cells are also subdivided into different populations based on surface markers, tissue localization, and function. Circulating T MEM cells include central memory (T CM ) and effector memory (T EM ) cells ( Jameson and Masopust, 2018 34. Jameson, S.C. ∙ Masopust, D.

Omilusik, K.D. ∙ Goldrath, A.W. Remembering to remember: T cell memory maintenance and plasticity Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2019; 58 :89-97 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ). T CM cells preferentially localize to secondary lymphoid organs and have superior proliferative capacity to trigger better recall responses ( Wherry et al., 2003a 79. Wherry, E.J. ∙ Teichgräber, V. ∙ Becker, T.C. ... Lineage relationship and protective immunity of memory CD8 T cell subsets Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4 :225-234 Crossref Scopus (1541) PubMed Google Scholar ), whereas T EM cells provide rapid protective immunity ( Omilusik and Goldrath, 2019 53. Omilusik, K.D. ∙ Goldrath, A.W. Remembering to remember: T cell memory maintenance and plasticity Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2019; 58 :89-97 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ). Tissue-resident memory (T RM ) ( Jameson and Masopust, 2018 34. Jameson, S.C. ∙ Masopust, D. Understanding Subset Diversity in T Cell Memory Immunity. 2018; 48 :214-226 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (349) PubMed Google Scholar ; Omilusik and Goldrath, 2019 53. Omilusik, K.D. ∙ Goldrath, A.W. Remembering to remember: T cell memory maintenance and plasticity Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2019; 58 :89-97 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ) and peripheral memory (T PM ) subsets ( Gerlach et al., 2016 19. Gerlach, C. ∙ Moseman, E.A. ∙ Loughhead, S.M. ... The Chemokine Receptor CX3CR1 Defines Three Antigen-Experienced CD8 T Cell Subsets with Distinct Roles in Immune Surveillance and Homeostasis Immunity. 2016; 45 :1270-1284 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (369) PubMed Google Scholar ) are also described. The heterogeneity of T MEM cells and the relationship to early events in effector responses remain incompletely understood, especially about the inhibitory pathways involved that may serve as functional targets to boost protective immunity in diverse disease contexts.
Cellular metabolism controls T cell activation and differentiation ( Chapman et al., 2020 10. Chapman, N.M. ∙ Boothby, M.R. ∙ Chi, H. Metabolic coordination of T cell quiescence and activation Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2020; 20 :55-70 Crossref Scopus (396) PubMed Google Scholar ; Geltink et al., 2018 18. Geltink, R.I.K. ∙ Kyle, R.L. ∙ Pearce, E.L. Unraveling the Complex Interplay Between T Cell Metabolism and Function Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2018; 36 :461-488 Crossref Scopus (512) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although ex vivo analysis of genetic mutants or in vitro culture systems provide important insights into T cell metabolic reprogramming, there are considerable differences for central carbon metabolism during T cell activation in vivo and in vitro ( Ma et al., 2019 49. Ma, E.H. ∙ Verway, M.J. ∙ Johnson, R.M. ... Metabolic Profiling Using Stable Isotope Tracing Reveals Distinct Patterns of Glucose Utilization by Physiologically Activated CD8 + T Cells Immunity. 2019; 51 :856-870.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (226) PubMed Google Scholar ). There is an urgent need to apply integrative and unbiased approaches to establish the functionally relevant metabolic pathways for T cell immunity in vivo . In particular, whether metabolic intervention in vivo can enhance the quantity and quality of T MEM responses is largely unknown.
Here, we used in vivo pooled CRISPR-Cas9 screening to uncover the metabolic regulators of MP and TE fate decisions in the acute lymphocytic choriomeningitis Armstrong strain (LCMV) infection model, leading to the identification of several nutrient signaling pathways that inhibit the quantity or quality of T MEM responses. Specifically, amino acid transporters, including Slc7a1 and Slc38a2, controlled the magnitude of T MEM generation and persistence by stimulating mTORC1 signaling. We also uncovered a terminally differentiated T EFF subset (called TE′, KLRG1 hi CXCR3 lo CD127 lo ), as well as cells in an intermediate, less differentiated state (called T INT , CXCR3 hi CD127 lo , to distinguish from TE′ and MP cells). The differentiation of TE′ from T INT cells was associated with reduced proliferative and metabolic activities and depended on a nutrient signaling axis composed of GDP-fucose biosynthesis, Pofut1 (protein O-fucosyltransferase 1; encoded by Pofut1 ) and Notch-Rbpj signaling. Pofut1 deficiency invigorated T EFF cells to exhibit sustained proliferation and metabolic activation, resulting in the expansion of the T EFF pool and generation of potent T MEM cells for enhanced in vivo killing capacity and antitumor immunity. Collectively, we establish nutrient signaling processes as important drivers for CD8 + T cell fate decisions in vivo and reveal mechanisms and targets for enhancing the quantity and quality of T MEM responses and protective immunity against pathogens and tumors.

Section: Results

To systemically uncover metabolic factors orchestrating MP and TE fate choices ( Joshi et al., 2007 35. Joshi, N.S. ∙ Cui, W. ∙ Chandele, A. ... Inflammation directs memory precursor and short-lived effector CD8(+) T cell fates via the graded expression of T-bet transcription factor Immunity. 2007; 27 :281-295 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1421) PubMed Google Scholar ), we designed an in vivo CRISPR-Cas9 screening system by transducing a pooled guide RNA (gRNA) library of 3,017 metabolism-associated genes ( Wei et al., 2019 78. Wei, J. ∙ Long, L. ∙ Zheng, W. ... Targeting REGNASE-1 programs long-lived effector T cells for cancer therapy Nature. 2019; 576 :471-476 Crossref Scopus (250) PubMed Google Scholar ) into CD8 + T cells expressing Cas9 and P14-transgenic TCRs specific for LCMV gp33 33−41 epitope ( Pircher et al., 1989 56. Pircher, H. ∙ Bürki, K. ∙ Lang, R. ... Tolerance induction in double specific T-cell receptor transgenic mice varies with antigen Nature. 1989; 342 :559-561 Crossref Scopus (916) PubMed Google Scholar ), followed by LCMV infection ( Figure 1 A). A total of 284 and 6 genes were upregulated and downregulated in MP versus TE cells, respectively (|log 2 fold change or FC| [MP/TE] > 0.58 [equivalent to FC of 1.5]; adjusted p < 0.05) ( Figure 1 B; Table S1 ). Among these, loss of Pten or Foxo1 reduced the MP/TE ratio, consistent with their roles in promoting T MEM generation ( Hand et al., 2010 25. Hand, T.W. ∙ Cui, W. ∙ Jung, Y.W. ... Differential effects of STAT5 and PI3K/AKT signaling on effector and memory CD8 T-cell survival Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

FOXO transcription factors throughout T cell biology Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2012; 12 :649-661 Crossref Scopus (262) PubMed Google Scholar ). Targeting Zc3h12a (also called Regnase-1 ) also decreased MP over TE generation, mainly due to the increased TE/input ratio, consistent with its negative role in T EFF responses ( Matsushita et al., 2009 50. Matsushita, K. ∙ Takeuchi, O. ∙ Standley, D.M. ...

Conversely, deficiency of known negative regulators for T MEM formation, including Tet2 ( Carty et al., 2018 9. Carty, S.A. ∙ Gohil, M. ∙ Banks, L.B. ... The Loss of TET2 Promotes CD8 + T Cell Memory Differentiation J. Immunol. 2018; 200 :82-91 Crossref Scopus (115) PubMed Google Scholar ; Fraietta et al., 2018 17.

Endo, Y. ∙ Onodera, A. ∙ Obata-Ninomiya, K. ... ACC1 determines memory potential of individual CD4 + T cells by regulating de novo fatty acid biosynthesis Nat. Metab. 2019; 1 :261-275 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ), and PI3K family members Pik3cg , Pik3cd , and Pik3r5 ( Hedrick et al., 2012 27. Hedrick, S.M. ∙ Hess Michelini, R. ∙ Doedens, A.L. ... FOXO transcription factors throughout T cell biology Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2012; 12 :649-661 Crossref Scopus (262) PubMed Google Scholar ; Saravia et al., 2020 67. Saravia, J. ∙ Raynor, J.L. ∙ Chapman, N.M. ... Signaling networks in immunometabolism Cell Res. 2020; 30 :328-342 Crossref Scopus (129) PubMed Google Scholar ), increased the MP/TE ratio. Thus, our in vivo CRISPR screening method captures metabolic regulators of CD8 + T cell fate decisions.
To validate our experimental system, we used an in vivo dual-color transfer system, where P14 cells transduced with either non-targeting control (NTC) single-guide RNA (sgNTC; GFP + ) or gene-specific sgRNA (Ametrine + ) were mixed at a 1:1 ratio, followed by transfer to the same host and LCMV infection. The different fluorescent proteins did not affect expression profiles of KLRG1 and CD127 or cell accumulation ( Figures S1 A and S1B). Targeting metabolic genes not enriched in our screening (e.g., Hk1 , Slc2a3 , and Slc2a6 ) ( Table S1 ) did not alter MP/TE ratios (data not shown). Of note, we achieved high efficiency of genome editing (73%–96%) for all target genes tested ( Figure S1 C). We chose Acaca and Pten as representative known negative and positive regulators of MP formation, respectively, for further validation. Targeting Acaca increased the MP/TE ratio ( Figures S1 D and S1E) and proportions of T MEM -associated CXCR3 hi CD27 hi and CD62L + cells ( Kaech and Cui, 2012 36. Kaech, S.M. ∙ Cui, W. Transcriptional control of effector and memory CD8+ T cell differentiation Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2012; 12 :749-761 Crossref Scopus (1113) PubMed Google Scholar ; Omilusik and Goldrath, 2019 53. Omilusik, K.D. ∙ Goldrath, A.W. Remembering to remember: T cell memory maintenance and plasticity Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2019; 58 :89-97 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ) at day 7.5 post-infection (p.i.) ( Figure S1 E), whereas deletion of Pten had the opposite effects ( Figures S1 F–S1H). Altogether, we have established a robust experimental system to investigate physiological regulators of TE and MP generation in vivo .
Negative regulators for T MEM generation and function remain incompletely understood. We therefore applied stringent cut-off criteria (adjusted p [MP/TE] < 0.05; log 2 FC [MP/TE] > 0.58; and log 2 FC [MP/input] > 0.58) to enrich for potential negative regulators of MP formation, which resulted in a total of 30 candidate genes ( Table S2 ). We observed an increased MP/TE ratio on targeting each of the 7 most-enriched novel regulators ( Slc7a1 , Pofut1 , Slc38a2 , Pde12 , Fdft1 , Elovl1 , and Dhrs7b ) ( Figure S1 I), indicative of enhanced MP formation. Our initial screening and validation experiments showed strong correlation (R 2 = 0.73; Figure 1 C), further verifying the faithful discovery of candidate genes for T cell fate choices.
Among the top-enriched negative regulators of MP formation were Slc7a1 (a cationic amino acid transporter) and Slc38a2 (a neutral amino acid transporter), whose roles in T MEM formation and function remain unknown. Slc7a1 - or Slc38a2 -null cells showed high gene editing efficiency ( Figure S1 C), with reduced target gene expression at the protein ( Figure S1 J) or mRNA ( Figure S1 K) levels. Slc7a1 - or Slc38a2- null cells had an increased MP/TE ratio ( Figure 1 D), associated with increased proportions of CXCR3 hi CD27 hi ( Figure 1 E) and CD62L + cells ( Figure 1 F). Further, co-deletion of Slc7a1 and Slc38a2 drastically promoted the MP/TE ratio as compared to the individual deletion ( Figure S1 L). Consistent with the pro-memory features, Slc7a1 -null cells had a reduced frequency of active caspase-3 + cells ( Figure 1 G) but increased expression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl2 ( Figure 1 H), as well as less cell death upon ex vivo culture with interleukin (IL)-2 ( Figure 1 I). Further, Slc7a1 -null OT-1 cells (specific for ovalbumin) ( Hogquist et al., 1994 30. Hogquist, K.A. ∙ Jameson, S.C. ∙ Heath, W.R. ... T cell receptor antagonist peptides induce positive selection Cell. 1994; 76 :17-27 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2401) PubMed Google Scholar ) showed increases in the MP/TE ratio and proportions of CXCR3 hi CD27 hi and CD62L + cells on infection with Listeria monocytogenes expressing OVA (Lm-OVA) ( Figure S1 M). These data collectively reveal the strong effects of amino acid transporters at restricting MP differentiation.
To determine the role of Slc7a1 and Slc38a2 in T MEM formation and function, we monitored the temporal dynamics of cellularity in the peripheral blood. Despite the modest reduction of T EFF numbers at day ∼7.5 p.i., loss of Slc7a1 or Slc38a2 significantly improved cell persistence during the contraction (days 8–30 p.i.) and memory phases (day > 30 p.i.) ( Figure 2 A). Importantly, deletion of Slc7a1 increased the frequency and cellularity of T MEM cells in multiple organs examined ( Figure 2 B). Slc7a1 deficiency also increased T CM (CD62L + ) and, to a lesser extent, T EM (CD62L − ) subsets ( Figure S2 A), in line with increased CD62L expression at the effector stage ( Figure 1 F). We further validated the improved cell accumulation ( Figure S2 B) and T MEM persistence ( Figure S2 C) using OT-1 cells and the Lm-OVA system. Thus, Slc7a1 deletion confers a quantitative advantage for T MEM formation, and this was also maintained on re-challenge at days 30–50 after primary infection with LCMV clone 13, a virulent strain of LCMV whose clearance depends on functional T MEM cells ( Rutishauser et al., 2009 63. Rutishauser, R.L. ∙ Martins, G.A. ∙ Kalachikov, S. ... Transcriptional repressor Blimp-1 promotes CD8(+) T cell terminal differentiation and represses the acquisition of central memory T cell properties Immunity. 2009; 31 :296-308 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (469) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wherry et al., 2003b 80. Wherry, E.J. ∙ Blattman, J.N. ∙ Murali-Krishna, K. ... Viral persistence alters CD8 T-cell immunodominance and tissue distribution and results in distinct stages of functional impairment J. Virol. 2003; 77 :4911-4927 Crossref Scopus (1273) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figures 2 C and 2D). To further test the functional effects, we performed an in vivo killing assay ( Kim et al., 2014 41. Kim, M.V. ∙ Ouyang, W. ∙ Liao, W. ... Murine in vivo CD8(+) T Cell Killing Assay Biol. Protoc. 2014; 4 :e1172 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 2 C). Host mice containing Slc7a1 - or Slc38a2 -null P14 cells more readily cleared antigen-pulsed splenocytes than those with control cells ( Figure 2 E), indicating the increased cytotoxic function of T MEM cells on deletion of these amino acid transporters.
To explore whether Slc7a1 -null T MEM cells mount better secondary responses on a per cell basis, we isolated P14 cells from mice at days 30–50 after primary infection and transferred equal numbers of sgNTC- or sg Slc7a1 -transduced cells into naive hosts, followed by LCMV infection ( Figure 2 C). At day 6 after secondary infection, there were comparable numbers of Slc7a1 -null secondary effector P14 cells ( Figure S2 D). Similar results were obtained using Slc7a1 -null OT-1 cells and the Lm-OVA infection system ( Figure S2 E). Thus, Slc7a1 deficiency enhances memory responses by selectively augmenting the quantity of T MEM cells, albeit not function on a per cell basis.
We next investigated the mechanism by which Slc7a1 and Slc38a2 restrict T MEM formation. The amino acid response (AAR) is induced on amino acid deprivation to promote de novo amino acid synthesis and uptake ( Kilberg et al., 2012 40. Kilberg, M.S. ∙ Balasubramanian, M. ∙ Fu, L. ... The transcription factor network associated with the amino acid response in mammalian cells Adv. Nutr. 2012; 3 :295-306 Crossref Scopus (112) PubMed Google Scholar ), and, accordingly, loss of Slc7a1 or Slc38a2 increased expression of AAR pathway genes, including Asns (Asparagine synthetase) and Trib3 (Tribbles homolog 3) ( Figures S2 F and S2G). Additionally, Ass1 (Argininosuccinate synthase 1), which mediates de novo arginine synthesis ( Haines et al., 2011 23. Haines, R.J. ∙ Pendleton, L.C. ∙ Eichler, D.C. Argininosuccinate synthase: at the center of arginine metabolism Int. J. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2011; 2 :8-23 PubMed Google Scholar ), was selectively upregulated in Slc7a1- but not Slc38a2- null cells ( Figure S2 H), in line with the role of Slc7a1 as an arginine transporter ( Verrey et al., 2004 77. Verrey, F. ∙ Closs, E.I. ∙ Wagner, C.A. ... CATs and HATs: the SLC7 family of amino acid transporters Pflugers Arch. 2004; 447 :532-542 Crossref Scopus (586) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, we generated mice with T cell-specific deletion of Slc38a2 ( Figure S2 I) and found that glutamine uptake and abundance ( Figures S2 J and S2K) were reduced in TCR-stimulated Slc38a2 -deficient cells, supporting the role of Slc38a2 as a glutamine transporter.
Amino acids promote mTORC1 signaling ( Huang et al., 2020 32. Huang, H. ∙ Long, L. ∙ Zhou, P. ... mTOR signaling at the crossroads of environmental signals and T-cell fate decisions Immunol. Rev. 2020; 295 :15-38 Crossref Scopus (120) PubMed Google Scholar ), whose activity was dynamically regulated in LCMV-specific T cells peaking at day 3 p.i., as measured by phosphorylation of S6 (pS6) ( Figure S2 L). Accordingly, surface expression of Slc7a1 was upregulated during the initial cell divisions ( Figure S2 M). On deletion of Slc7a1 or Slc38a2 , mTORC1 activity was greatly reduced at day 3 p.i. ( Figures 2 F and 2G). Co-deletion of Slc7a1 with Nprl3 , a component of GATOR1 complex that suppresses nutrient-mediated mTORC1 signaling ( Saxton and Sabatini, 2017 69. Saxton, R.A. ∙ Sabatini, D.M. mTOR Signaling in Growth, Metabolism, and Disease Cell. 2017; 168 :960-976 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (4143) PubMed Google Scholar ), partially blocked the increased MP/TE ratio at day 7.5 p.i. ( Figure 2 H), as well as the increased formation and cellularity of Slc7a1 -null T MEM cells ( Figures 2 I and 2J), indicating the functional effects of altered mTORC1 signaling at shaping T MEM generation. Together, these results indicate that the magnitude of T MEM generation and long-term persistence can be reprogrammed by targeting amino acid transporters, in part via modulating mTORC1 activity.
The success of immunotherapy relies on both effective T EFF responses and T cell persistence ( Crompton et al., 2014 15. Crompton, J.G. ∙ Sukumar, M. ∙ Restifo, N.P. Uncoupling T-cell expansion from effector differentiation in cell-based immunotherapy Immunol. Rev. 2014; 257 :264-276 Crossref Scopus (105) PubMed Google Scholar ). We next aimed to identify molecules whose deletion endows T cells with both effector function and longevity. One such candidate molecule was Pofut1, a glycosyltransferase that adds fucose to its target proteins ( Schneider et al., 2017 70. Schneider, M. ∙ Al-Shareffi, E. ∙ Haltiwanger, R.S. Biological functions of fucose in mammals Glycobiology. 2017; 27 :601-618 Crossref Scopus (271) PubMed Google Scholar ). sg Pofut1 -transduced cells had efficient gene editing ( Figure S1 C) and reduced protein levels of Pofut1 ( Figure S3 A). Pofut1 -null cells had increased MP/TE ratio, associated with normal MP and reduced TE frequencies at day 7.5 p.i. ( Figures 1 C and 3 A). However, deletion of Pofut1 enhanced the cellularity of T EFF cells and GzmB expression levels in all organs examined ( Figures 3 B and 3C). The number of IFN(interferon)-γ + TNF-α + (tumor necrosis factor alpha) cells was also increased in the absence of Pofut1 ( Figure 3 D), albeit with slightly reduced frequency ( Figure S3 B). Thus, Pofut1 deletion reduced TE frequency, but improved accumulation of T EFF cells with cytotoxic features. We next examined the role of Pofut1 in T MEM formation. By days 35–50 p.i., Pofut1 -null cells were more abundant than control cells in multiple organs ( Figure 3 E). The increased T MEM accumulation was not simply secondary to the numeric differences at the effector stage, because the relative proportion of Pofut1 -deficient cells compared to control (“spike”) P14 cells modestly increased over time (compare total cellularity in Figures 3 B and 3E). Also, Pofut1 -deficient P14 cells had better survival after ex vivo culture with IL-2 ( Figure 3 F). Therefore, Pofut1 deficiency enhances T EFF responses and T MEM accumulation.
We then examined expression of T EFF and T MEM signature molecules. Pofut1 deletion increased the frequency of CXCR3 hi CD27 hi cells at the effector ( Figure 3 G) and memory ( Figure S3 C) stages following LCMV infection. At the memory stage, Pofut1 -deficient P14 T MEM cells also had a modestly higher frequency of KLRG1 – CD127 + cells at the expense of KLRG1 + CD127 – cells ( Figure S3 D). Further, loss of Pofut1 improved recall capacity post-secondary infection ( Figures 3 H and 3I). Thus, despite extensive expansion at the effector stage, Pofut1 deficiency enhances acquisition of T MEM -associated properties.
In the Lm-OVA infection model, we also observed the increased MP/TE ratio and CXCR3 hi CD27 hi cell frequency at the effector stage ( Figure S3 E), as well as enhanced T MEM formation due to Pofut1 deficiency ( Figure S3 F). In the in vivo killing assay ( Figure 3 J), host mice containing Pofut1 -null OT-1 cells more readily cleared antigen-pulsed splenocytes ( Figure 3 K). Moreover, on rechallenge with OVA-bearing B16 melanoma at 1 month after Lm-OVA infection ( Figure 3 J), mice containing sg Pofut1 -transduced OT-1 cells displayed superior tumor control, as well as improved overall survival, compared to those given sgNTC-transduced cells ( Figures 3 L and 3M). Thus, loss of Pofut1 simultaneously promotes T EFF responses and T MEM functions in multiple systems, associated with increased protective immunity.
Next, we generated mice with T cell-specific deletion of Pofut1 by crossing mice bearing floxed Pofut1 alleles ( Shi and Stanley, 2003 72. Shi, S. ∙ Stanley, P. Protein O-fucosyltransferase 1 is an essential component of Notch signaling pathways Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100 :5234-5239 Crossref Scopus (341) PubMed Google Scholar ) with those expressing Cre recombinase under the Cd4 promotor ( Cd4 Cre Pofut1 fl/fl ). The cellularity of conventional CD4 + T cells from these mice was comparable to wild-type (WT) mice, while there was a moderate increase in the frequency of Treg (regulatory T) cells ( Figures S3 G and S3H). In contrast, Cd4 Cre Pofut1 fl/fl mice had reduced frequency and number of CD8 + T cells ( Figures S3 G and S3H). On challenge with LCMV, there was an increased MP/TE ratio and frequency of CXCR3 hi CD27 hi cells in the endogenous antigen-specific gp33 + CD8 + T cells from Cd4 Cre Pofut1 fl/fl mice ( Figures S3 I and S3J). To explore cell-intrinsic effects, we generated mixed bone marrow (BM) chimeras by reconstituting Rag1 −/− mice with BM cells from CD45.1 + “spike” and CD45.2 + WT or Cd4 Cre Pofut1 fl/fl mice. After LCMV infection, we observed an increased MP/TE ratio and CXCR3 hi CD27 hi cell frequency in CD45.2 + Pofut1 -deficient CD8 + T cells ( Figure S3 K). Moreover, the frequencies of CD45.2 + gp33 + cells ( Figure S3 L), CD45.2 + IFN-γ + , and CD45.2 + TNF-α + cells ( Figure S3 M) were all elevated in the absence of Pofut1 . Thus, conditional deletion of Pofut1 enhances T EFF responses in a cell-intrinsic manner.
We next examined T MEM accumulation and recall capacity. Antigen-specific CD8 + T cells from Cd4 Cre Pofut1 fl/fl mice were more abundant at days 40–50 p.i. than WT counterparts ( Figure S3 N). On secondary transfer and re-challenge, Pofut1 -deficient gp33 + T MEM cells gave rise to more secondary effector cells ( Figure S3 O). Thus, genetic loss of Pofut1 promotes both T EFF and T MEM responses, supporting the conclusions from sgRNA-mediated targeting of Pofut1 .
To determine the molecular basis, we performed transcriptome analysis of sgNTC- and sg Pofut1 -transduced P14 cells at day 7.5 p.i. Differential expression analysis revealed that TE-associated genes ( Klrg1 , S1pr5 , Cx3cr1 , Gzma , and Zeb2 ) were decreased in Pofut1 -null cells ( Figure 4 A). Accordingly, GSEA (gene set enrichment analysis) showed that TE signature was among the most downregulated CD8 + T cell-related gene sets in Pofut1 -null cells ( Figure S4 A; Table S3 ), whereas MP signature was modestly enriched ( Figure S4 A; Table S3 ). Moreover, genes upregulated in day 6 versus day 10 T EFF cells ( Pearce et al., 2009 55. Pearce, E.L. ∙ Walsh, M.C. ∙ Cejas, P.J. ... Enhancing CD8 T-cell memory by modulating fatty acid metabolism Nature. 2009; 460 :103-107 Crossref Scopus (1255) PubMed Google Scholar ), which we called “early-effector-like” signatures, were among the top 10 CD8 + T cell-related gene sets enriched in Pofut1 -null cells ( Figure S4 B; Table S3 ), suggesting a gene expression program associated with early effector function. Consistent with this notion, cell cycle-related pathways were enriched in the absence of Pofut1 ( Figure 4 B), and accordingly, Pofut1 -null cells had higher BrdU (bromodeoxyuridine) incorporation at days 6.5–7.5 p.i. ( Figure 4 C), indicating a suppressive effect of Pofut1 on T EFF proliferation.
We next analyzed the role of Pofut1 in other contexts of T cell proliferation. We found that T cells from Cd4 Cre Pofut1 fl/fl mice had largely normal Ki-67 expression, except for a modest reduction of Ki-67 + population in Treg cells ( Figure S4 C). Naive CD8 + T cells isolated from these mice also showed undisturbed proliferation after TCR stimulation ( Figure S4 D). Next, we examined the proliferation by CellTrace Violet (CTV) dilution of sgNTC- or sg Pofut1- transduced P14 cells and observed a similar extent of proliferation at day 2.5 p.i. ( Figure S4 E), a time point when CXCR3 expression was already upregulated to denote functional effects of Pofut1 deletion ( Figure S4 F). Analysis of cellularity at later time points indicated that the number of Pofut1 -null cells remained unchanged at day 5 p.i. ( Figure S4 G), but these cells showed a significantly higher extent of BrdU incorporation at days 4.5–5 ( Figure S4 H). By day 7.5 p.i., Pofut1 -null cells had higher cellularity than control cells ( Figure S4 G). Therefore, instead of acting as a general cell-cycle inhibitor, Pofut1 restricts cell proliferation in a temporal and context-dependent manner.
Compared to MP cells, TE cells were enriched with cell cycle-related signatures and had increased BrdU incorporation at days 6.5–7.5 p.i. ( Figures S4 I and S4J), in line with the notion that TE cells exit the cell cycle later than MP cells during tail-end of the effector stage ( Sarkar et al., 2008 68. Sarkar, S. ∙ Kalia, V. ∙ Haining, W.N. ... Functional and genomic profiling of effector CD8 T cell subsets with distinct memory fates J. Exp. Med. 2008; 205 :625-640 Crossref Scopus (499) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, reduction of TE population is frequently associated with impaired T EFF expansion ( Restifo and Gattinoni, 2013 60. Restifo, N.P. ∙ Gattinoni, L. Lineage relationship of effector and memory T cells Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2013; 25 :556-563 Crossref Scopus (166) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, the findings that Pofut1 -null T EFF cells had reduced TE-associated features but increased proliferation were intriguing, because they suggest that T EFF cells can exhibit lower TE-associated programming but higher proliferation in certain contexts. To this end, we analyzed a public scRNA-seq (single-cell RNA sequencing) dataset of P14 cells from LCMV-infected mice at day 8 p.i. ( Chen et al., 2019 12. Chen, Z. ∙ Ji, Z. ∙ Ngiow, S.F. ... TCF-1-Centered Transcriptional Network Drives an Effector versus Exhausted CD8 T Cell-Fate Decision Immunity. 2019; 51 :840-855.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (376) PubMed Google Scholar ), and unsupervised clustering partitioned the cells into three clusters in UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) plot ( McInnes et al., 2018 51. McInnes, L. ∙ Healy, J. ∙ Melville, J. UMAP: uniform manifold approximation and projection for dimension reduction arXiv. 2018; arXiv:1802.03426 Google Scholar ; Figure 4 D). Pre-ranked GSEA ( Korotkevich et al., 2019 42. Korotkevich, G. ∙ Sukhov, V. ∙ Sergushichev, A. Fast gene set enrichment analysis bioRxiv. 2019; Crossref Google Scholar ) indicated that cluster 1, which accounted for ∼15% of the entire population ( Figure 4 D), was enriched for TE signatures and those with low abundance in naive T cells (“naïve-cell low”) ( Figure S5 A; Table S4 ), suggesting that this cluster contains more terminally differentiated cells (called TE′). Cluster 2 was enriched for MP and naive- and T MEM -associated signatures (denoted as the MP population), whereas cluster 3, which constituted ∼75% of total cells ( Figure 4 D), was enriched for “early-effector-like” signatures ( Figure S5 A), likely existing in an intermediate stage (called T INT ). Next, differential expression analysis for surface proteins across each cluster ( Figure S5 B) revealed that the combined use of Klrg1 , Cxcr3 and Il7r (encodes CD127) was able to largely define these three clusters, with TE′ cells marked by Klrg1 hi Cxcr3 lo Il7r lo , MP by Klrg1 lo Cxcr3 hi Il7r hi and T INT by Klrg1 int/lo Cxcr3 hi Il7r lo ( Figure 4 E). Also, flow cytometry analysis identified these cells at approximately similar frequencies as inferred by scRNA-seq ( Figure 4 F), namely TE′ (KLRG1 hi CXCR3 lo CD127 lo ), MP (KLRG1 lo CXCR3 hi CD127 hi , same as KLRG1 − CD127 + cells described above, all of which expressed CXCR3), and T INT (CXCR3 hi CD127 lo ) cells. Similarly, we identified these cells in LCMV- and Lm-OVA-infected mice that, respectively, received adoptive transfer of in vitro -preactivated P14 cells ( Figure S5 C) and OT-1 cells ( Figure S5 D), indicating the presence of these distinct T EFF subsets in various contexts.
Transcriptome profiling of TE′, MP, and T INT cells at day 7.5 p.i. revealed distinct patterns in PCA (principal component analysis) plot ( Figure 4 G). Population-specific gene signatures were then generated that identified 402, 111, and 84 genes uniquely expressed by TE′, MP, and T INT cells, respectively ( Table S5 ). Functional enrichment analysis identified the expected enrichments of TE- and MP-associated signatures in TE′ and MP cells, respectively ( Figure S5 E), whereas T INT cells were enriched for “early-effector-like” T EFF signatures ( Figure S5 E), confirming these cells in a transitional state. Moreover, GSEA showed enrichment of cell cycle-related Hallmark signatures in T INT cells ( Figure S5 F), which was validated by their elevated BrdU incorporation at days 6.5–7.5 p.i. ( Figure 4 H). To explore the developmental trajectory of these cells, we applied RNA velocity analysis ( La Manno et al., 2018 43. La Manno, G. ∙ Soldatov, R. ∙ Zeisel, A. ... RNA velocity of single cells Nature. 2018; 560 :494-498 Crossref Scopus (1950) PubMed Google Scholar ) and identified a directional flow from T INT toward TE′ cells ( Figure S5 G). Then, we sorted T INT and TE′ cells at day 7.5 p.i. and transferred them to infection-matched recipients ( Figure 4 I). At day 4 after transfer (that is day 11.5 p.i.), a substantial proportion of T INT cells converted to TE′ or CXCR3 hi CD127 hi cells that contain MP cells, whereas TE′ cells retained their cell state ( Figure 4 I), validating the directionality from T INT to TE′ cells.
We next determined the effects of Pofut1 deletion on these populations. Strikingly, the TE′ population was nearly absent in Pofut1 -null P14 cells, whereas T INT cells were accumulated ( Figure 4 J), suggesting a possible role for Pofut1 in driving T INT to TE′ transition. Using several unbiased analyses to test this hypothesis, we first found that the Pofut1-dependent signature (downregulated genes in Pofut1 -null cells described in Figure 4 A; Table S6 ) was mainly expressed by the TE′ population ( Figure 4 K). Second, Pofut1 -null cells upregulated T INT - and MP-specific genes but downregulated TE′-specific genes ( Figure S6 A). Third, GSEA verified that Pofut1 -null cells selectively downregulated TE′ signature, but upregulated T INT and MP signatures ( Figure S6 B). Fourth, in scRNA-seq of sgNTC- and sg Pofut1 -transduced P14 cells at day 7 p.i., UMAP visualization showed that Pofut1 -null cells were markedly underrepresented in specific regions (lower left regions; Figure 4 L) marked by high expression of Klrg1 and low expression of Cxcr3 and Il7r ( Figure 4 M), but co-existed with sgNTC-transduced P14 cells in the remaining regions ( Figure 4 L), indicative of a selective loss of TE′ cells in the absence of Pofut1 . The TE′ signature was enriched in regions where sgNTC-transduced P14 cells were more abundant than sg Pofut1 -transduced cells ( Figure S6 C). These unbiased bioinformatic analyses collectively point to a role of Pofut1 in promoting TE′ generation. We validated this notion in an adoptive transfer experiment, where Pofut1 -deficient T INT cells showed a complete blockade in differentiation into TE′ cells ( Figure 4 N). Thus, Pofut1 drives the differentiation of cells from a highly proliferative, T EFF -poised state (T INT ) into a less proliferative, terminal T EFF population (TE′). Deletion of Pofut1 blocked TE′ formation and instead promoted T EFF cells to acquire properties of both T INT and MP cells, which enables T EFF cells to undergo extensive proliferation in a less differentiated state during the tail-end of antigen clearance.
To determine the underlying mechanisms, we sorted sgNTC- or sg Pofut1 -transduced P14 cells from the dual-color transfer system at day 5 p.i., when Pofut1 -deficient P14 cells started to exhibit a proliferative advantage ( Figure S4 H), and performed ATAC-seq and transcriptome analyses. Pofut1 -sufficient and -deficient P14 cells had a largely distinct chromatin landscape in ATAC-seq ( Figure S6 D). Transcription factor motif enrichment ( Figure 5 A) and footprinting ( Figure 5 B) analyses ( Karmaus et al., 2019 39. Karmaus, P.W.F. ∙ Chen, X. ∙ Lim, S.A. ... Metabolic heterogeneity underlies reciprocal fates of T H 17 cell stemness and plasticity Nature. 2019; 565 :101-105 Crossref Scopus (138) PubMed Google Scholar ) predicted the increased occupancy of AP-1 family factors (Jun, JunB, Fosl1, Fos, and BATF) in Pofut1 -null P14 cells ( Figure 5 A). In contrast, Pofut1 -null cells showed lower binding of Sp1/KLF family factors ( Figures 5 A and S6 E), consistent with these factors being negative rheostats for T cell proliferation ( Yamada et al., 2009 81. Yamada, T. ∙ Park, C.S. ∙ Mamonkin, M. ... Transcription factor ELF4 controls the proliferation and homing of CD8+ T cells via the Krüppel-like factors KLF4 and KLF2 Nat. Immunol. 2009; 10 :618-626 Crossref Scopus (113) PubMed Google Scholar ).
In transcriptome analysis, GSEA revealed that Pofut1 -null cells were enriched with metabolic pathways, including fatty acid metabolism, glycolysis, Myc, and mTORC1 signaling ( Huang et al., 2020 32. Huang, H. ∙ Long, L. ∙ Zhou, P. ... mTOR signaling at the crossroads of environmental signals and T-cell fate decisions Immunol. Rev. 2020; 295 :15-38 Crossref Scopus (120) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 5 C). Indeed, loss of Pofut1 increased phosphorylation of S6 ( Figure 5 D), associated with augmented cell size and CD71 and CD98 expression, which are mTORC1-dependent signature events ( Yang et al., 2013 82. Yang, K. ∙ Shrestha, S. ∙ Zeng, H. ... T cell exit from quiescence and differentiation into Th2 cells depend on Raptor-mTORC1-mediated metabolic reprogramming Immunity. 2013; 39 :1043-1056 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (302) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 5 D). We also observed increased staining for Mitotracker (indicative of mitochondrial mass), TMRM (mitochondrial membrane potential), and CellROX (intracellular reactive oxygen species [ROS]) in Pofut1 -null P14 cells at day 5 p.i. ( Figure 5 E), indicative of enhanced mitochondrial fitness. Moreover, Pofut1-null cells had increased oxygen consumption rate (OCR, indicator of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation [OXPHOS]) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR, indicator of aerobic glycolysis) at day 5 p.i. ( Figures 5 F and 5G). Thus, Pofut1 restrains mTORC1 signaling and metabolic programming at the effector phase of CD8 + T cell responses.
We next examined whether T INT to TE′ maturation is associated with altered mTORC1 and metabolic activities in WT cells. Compared to T INT cells, TE′ cells had reduced mTORC1-related parameters (cell size and CD71 and CD98 expression) ( Figure 5 H), and lower mitochondrial profiles ( Figure 5 I). Moreover, TE′ cells had decreased OCR and ECAR ( Figures 5 J and 5K), further revealing metabolic heterogeneity of T EFF cells. Therefore, T INT to TE′ maturation is accompanied by proliferative and metabolic inactivation.
To determine whether Pofut1 relies on its fucosyltransferase activity in T cell fate decisions, we generated a Pofut1 mutant (R245A) deficient in fucosyltransferase activity ( Okajima et al., 2005 52. Okajima, T. ∙ Xu, A. ∙ Lei, L. ... Chaperone activity of protein O-fucosyltransferase 1 promotes notch receptor folding Science. 2005; 307 :1599-1603 Crossref Scopus (214) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found it unable to restore the TE′ differentiation defects caused by loss of Pofut1 ( Figures 6 A and S7 A). As Pofut1 transfers the fucose group from GDP-fucose to target proteins ( Schneider et al., 2017 70. Schneider, M. ∙ Al-Shareffi, E. ∙ Haltiwanger, R.S. Biological functions of fucose in mammals Glycobiology. 2017; 27 :601-618 Crossref Scopus (271) PubMed Google Scholar ), we then designed gRNAs targeting Gmds (GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase) and Fcsk (fucose kinase) ( Figure S7 B), which are key enzymes required for de novo synthesis and salvage pathways for GDP-fucose biosynthesis, respectively ( Schneider et al., 2017 70. Schneider, M. ∙ Al-Shareffi, E. ∙ Haltiwanger, R.S. Biological functions of fucose in mammals Glycobiology. 2017; 27 :601-618 Crossref Scopus (271) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although deletion of Gmds or Fcsk partially or minimally affected TE′ differentiation, respectively, co-deletion of both genes largely recapitulated the phenotypes caused by Pofut1 deletion, including abolished TE′ differentiation ( Figure 6 B), as well as increased T cell accumulation ( Figure 6 C), MP/TE ratio ( Figure S7 C), and mitochondrial features ( Figure S7 D). Deletion of Gmds or Fcsk resulted in a drastic reduction of intracellular GDP-fucose level ( Figure S7 E), indicating a role of GDP-fucose availability for T INT to TE′ transition.
We next explored the downstream mechanism by which Pofut1 controls T INT to TE′ transition. Unbiased GSEA of the transcriptome of sg Pofut1 - and sgNTC-transduced cells revealed that Notch signaling was the only significantly (false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.05) downregulated Hallmark pathway in Pofut1 -null cells ( Figure 6 D). Dtx1 , a Notch signaling target gene ( Hsiao et al., 2009 31. Hsiao, H.W. ∙ Liu, W.H. ∙ Wang, C.J. ... Deltex1 is a target of the transcription factor NFAT that promotes T cell anergy Immunity. 2009; 31 :72-83 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ), was the most downregulated gene in Pofut1 -null cells ( Figures 6 E and 6F). Further, Pofut1 deficiency reduced the protein level of Notch intracellular domain (NICD) ( Figure 6 G), the active form of Notch for transcriptional activation ( Guruharsha et al., 2012 20. Guruharsha, K.G. ∙ Kankel, M.W. ∙ Artavanis-Tsakonas, S. The Notch signalling system: recent insights into the complexity of a conserved pathway Nat. Rev. Genet. 2012; 13 :654-666 Crossref Scopus (570) PubMed Google Scholar ). We next tested the regulation of Notch activity among different T EFF subpopulations. GSEA of the transcriptome of TE′, MP and T INT cells revealed that TE′ cells had higher levels of Notch signature than MP or T INT cells ( Figure S7 F). Importantly, perturbation of Notch signaling by co-deletion of Notch1 and Notch2 ( Figures 6 H and 6I) or targeting Rbpj ( Figures 6 J and 6K), the major transcriptional effector of Notch signaling ( Guruharsha et al., 2012 20. Guruharsha, K.G. ∙ Kankel, M.W. ∙ Artavanis-Tsakonas, S. The Notch signalling system: recent insights into the complexity of a conserved pathway Nat. Rev. Genet. 2012; 13 :654-666 Crossref Scopus (570) PubMed Google Scholar ), recapitulated the phenotypes of Pofut1 deficiency, including the increased T EFF accumulation ( Figures 6 H and 6J) and reduced TE′ differentiation ( Figures 6 I and 6K). Moreover, consistent with the roles of GDP-fucose availability in mediating Pofut1 function, co-deletion of Gmds and Fcsk strongly decreased Dtx1 expression ( Figure S7 G). Therefore, Pofut1 links GDP-fucose synthesis to Notch-Rbpj signaling in T INT to TE′ differentiation.
Given the requirement of Notch signaling in TE′ differentiation, we explored whether its hyperactivation is sufficient to drive TE′ differentiation. In scRNA-seq analysis of cells with ectopic expression of empty vector control or NICD, UMAP visualization revealed distinct subpopulations, with NICD-overexpressing cells predominately accumulating in cluster 1 ( Figures 7 A and 7B), corresponding to Klrg1 hi Cxcr3 lo Il7r lo TE′ cells ( Figure 7 C). This notion was verified by flow cytometry analysis showing that NICD expression promoted TE′ differentiation ( Figure 7 D). Transcriptome analysis showed that NICD-overexpressing cells had higher TE′ signature ( Figure 7 E), but reduced “early-effector-like” ( Figure 7 F), proliferation, and mTORC1-associated signatures ( Figure 7 G). Flow cytometry analysis validated that overexpression of NICD reduced cell proliferation (indicated by expression of Ki-67) and metabolic parameters, including Mitotracker, TMRM, and CellROX ( Figure 7 H). Thus, hyperactivation of Notch signaling is sufficient to drive TE′ differentiation.
Moreover, overexpression of NICD in Pofut1 -null cells largely rectified the TE′ differentiation defect ( Figure 7 I), as well as the increased T EFF accumulation ( Figure 7 J). In transcriptome analysis, the altered transcriptome profiles ( Figure S7 H) and gene expression patterns ( Figure 7 K) between Pofut1 -null and WT cells were substantially mitigated by NICD overexpression. These data collectively indicate that Pofut1 depends on Notch activity to direct T cell fate.

Section: Discussion

Understanding antigen-specific CD8 + T cell fate decisions, and how to improve the quantity and quality of CD8 + T cells, are fundamental questions in T cell biology ( Araki et al., 2009 4. Araki, K. ∙ Turner, A.P. ∙ Shaffer, V.O. ... mTOR regulates memory CD8 T-cell differentiation Nature. 2009; 460 :108-112 Crossref Scopus (1283) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hamilton and Jameson, 2012 24. Hamilton, S.E. ∙ Jameson, S.C. CD8 T cell memory: it takes all kinds Front. Immunol. 2012; 3 :353 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, we, together with Chen et al. (2021 13. Chen, Z. ∙ Arai, E. ∙ Khan, O. ... In vivo CD8+ T cell CRISPR screening reveals control by Fli1 in infection and cancer Cell. 2021; 184 Published online February 25, 2021 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (103) Google Scholar , in this issue of Cell ), demonstrated in vivo pooled CRISPR-based screenings as powerful tools to discover functionally relevant regulators of CD8 + T cell fate decisions. Further, integration of systems approaches and experimental validations enabled the discovery of mechanisms that orchestrate the quantity and quality of T MEM responses. Our findings point to nutrient signaling including amino acid transporters and GDP-fucose-Pofut1-Notch axis as key processes for controlling the quantity and quality of T MEM responses, which may ultimately pave the way for innovative immunotherapies against infectious diseases and tumors.
Our study provided an integrative view of cellular metabolism in TE and MP fate choices. Specifically, we identified amino acid transporters, Slc7a1 and Slc38a2, as crucial determinants of T MEM formation and accumulation, in part, by modulating mTORC1 signaling. Although asymmetric segregation of amino acid transporters during the first cell division is associated with memory- and effector-like CD8 + T cell fate decisions ( Pollizzi et al., 2016 58. Pollizzi, K.N. ∙ Sun, I.H. ∙ Patel, C.H. ... Asymmetric inheritance of mTORC1 kinase activity during division dictates CD8(+) T cell differentiation Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17 :704-711 Crossref Scopus (176) PubMed Google Scholar ; Verbist et al., 2016 76. Verbist, K.C. ∙ Guy, C.S. ∙ Milasta, S. ... Metabolic maintenance of cell asymmetry following division in activated T lymphocytes Nature. 2016; 532 :389-393 Crossref Scopus (210) PubMed Google Scholar ), studies testing the effects of genetic perturbation of amino acid transporters on T MEM responses are lacking. Our data showed that loss of certain amino acid transporters improved T MEM persistence and in vivo killing capacity, suggesting possible roles for nutrient uptake and sensing as crucial determinants of T cell fate decisions. Our study therefore implicates amino acid restriction as a possible means to promote T MEM responses, such as during vaccinations.
How metabolic pathways contribute to the dynamics and heterogeneity of T cell subsets is largely unclear. We had an unexpected discovery that the majority of T EFF cells at days 7–8 p.i., a stage when LCMV infection has been resolved, was in an intermediate state (that we called T INT ). Transcriptomic analysis and experimental validations revealed that TE′, MP, and T INT cells were in distinct functional states, and T INT cells can be the precursors of the more stable population of TE′ cells, thereby highlighting the plasticity and heterogeneity of the T EFF pool. Our identification of the transitional T INT cells is in line with the observations that certain KLRG1 + effector cells are able to lose KLRG1 expression (called exKLRG1 precursors) and contribute to all memory T cell lineages ( Herndler-Brandstetter et al., 2018 29. Herndler-Brandstetter, D. ∙ Ishigame, H. ∙ Shinnakasu, R. ... KLRG1 + Effector CD8 + T Cells Lose KLRG1, Differentiate into All Memory T Cell Lineages, and Convey Enhanced Protective Immunity Immunity. 2018; 48 :716-729.e8 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (267) PubMed Google Scholar ) and that early effector cells (T EE cells, KLRG1 lo CD127 lo ) possess the potential for development into both TE and MP cells ( Lefrançois and Obar, 2010 44. Lefrançois, L. ∙ Obar, J.J. Once a killer, always a killer: from cytotoxic T cell to memory cell Immunol. Rev. 2010; 235 :206-218 Crossref Scopus (76) PubMed Google Scholar ), although how exKLRG1 precursors and T EE cells retain their developmental plasticity remains unclear. Our model of T EFF heterogeneity, composed of MP, TE′, and T INT cells, may provide new insight into fate choices of the aforementioned T EFF cells in that T INT cells, exKLRG1 precursors, and T EE cells may share similar developmental trajectories. We propose that T EFF cells that receive GDP-fucose-Pofut1-Notch-Rbpj signaling can convert to the more terminal TE′ cells, whereas the remaining cells without such a signal may retain their plasticity. In addition to understanding the developmental plasticity of T EFF subsets, the context-dependent role of Notch signaling is also an important question. Although Pofut1 is implicated in regulating Notch receptors in non-immune cells ( Okajima et al., 2005 52. Okajima, T. ∙ Xu, A. ∙ Lei, L. ... Chaperone activity of protein O-fucosyltransferase 1 promotes notch receptor folding Science. 2005; 307 :1599-1603 Crossref Scopus (214) PubMed Google Scholar ; Shi and Stanley, 2003 72. Shi, S. ∙ Stanley, P. Protein O-fucosyltransferase 1 is an essential component of Notch signaling pathways Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100 :5234-5239 Crossref Scopus (341) PubMed Google Scholar ), the finding that Notch signaling promotes terminal differentiation at the expense of cell-cycle progression and anabolic programs is unexpected, considering the positive role of Notch signaling in proliferative responses during initial T cell activation ( Adler et al., 2003 1. Adler, S.H. ∙ Chiffoleau, E. ∙ Xu, L. ...

TCR-mediated Notch signaling regulates proliferation and IFN-gamma production in peripheral T cells J. Immunol. 2003; 171 :3019-3024 Crossref Scopus (210) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our study thereby highlights context-dependent roles of Notch signaling in T cell responses that can be targeted for therapeutic benefits. The detailed biochemical basis by which Pofut1 regulates Notch signaling is a key question for future studies.
Recent emphasis has placed on how T cell heterogeneity affects the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and during chronic infection. Several studies reveal that the TCF1 + precursor cells, but not terminally exhausted cells, are able to expand and respond to ICB therapy for cancer ( Kallies et al., 2020 38. Kallies, A. ∙ Zehn, D. ∙ Utzschneider, D.T. Precursor exhausted T cells: key to successful immunotherapy? Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2020; 20 :128-136 Crossref Scopus (248) PubMed Google Scholar ). TCF1 + precursor cells are the predominate population responding to anti-PD-1 blockade in chronic infections ( He et al., 2016 26. He, R. ∙ Hou, S. ∙ Liu, C. ... Follicular CXCR5- expressing CD8(+) T cells curtail chronic viral infection Nature. 2016; 537 :412-428 Crossref Scopus (475) PubMed Google Scholar ; Im et al., 2016 33. Im, S.J. ∙ Hashimoto, M. ∙ Gerner, M.Y. ... Defining CD8+ T cells that provide the proliferative burst after PD-1 therapy Nature. 2016; 537 :417-421 Crossref Scopus (1294) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, we found that loss of Pofut1 promoted the expansion of cells in an intermediate state without compromising the long-term persistence of T MEM cells, which highlights mechanisms of precursor T cell reprogramming in the context of acute infection. To explore the possible role of Pofut1 in the TME and during chronic infection, we examined the correlation of Pofut1-dependent signature ( Table S6 ) with patient survival datasets in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and with the responsiveness to ICB therapies in public datasets ( Sade-Feldman et al., 2018 64. Sade-Feldman, M. ∙ Yizhak, K. ∙ Bjorgaard, S.L. ... Defining T Cell States Associated with Response to Checkpoint Immunotherapy in Melanoma Cell. 2018; 175 :998-1013.e20 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1075) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that Pofut1-dependent signature was inversely correlated with survival of patients with certain tumors, and such signature in CD8 + T cells was also inversely correlated with the responsiveness to immunotherapies (our unpublished findings). Therefore, targeting Pofut1 may represent a unique opportunity with broad implications for T cell-mediated therapies for cancer.
Collectively, by integrating multiple functional immunogenomic approaches (e.g., in vivo pooled screening, transcriptome, ATAC-seq, and scRNA-seq) and extensive experimental validations, our study provides a comprehensive view of how diverse nutrient signaling pathways negatively shape the quantity and quality of T MEM cells. Overall, we predict that the gain-of-function effects elicited by targeting these metabolic and nutrient signaling regulators will likely open new avenues for therapeutic invention of infection and cancer.

Mice, including both sexes, between the ages of 7–16 weeks were used for the study. We crossed Rosa26-Cas9 knockin mice ( Platt et al., 2014 57. Platt, R.J. ∙ Chen, S. ∙ Zhou, Y. ... CRISPR-Cas9 knockin mice for genome editing and cancer modeling Cell. 2014; 159 :440-455 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1386) PubMed Google Scholar ) with OT-1 ( Hogquist et al., 1994 30. Hogquist, K.A. ∙ Jameson, S.C. ∙ Heath, W.R. ... T cell receptor antagonist peptides induce positive selection Cell. 1994; 76 :17-27 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2401) PubMed Google Scholar ) or P14 transgenic mice ( Pircher et al., 1989 56. Pircher, H. ∙ Bürki, K. ∙ Lang, R. ... Tolerance induction in double specific T-cell receptor transgenic mice varies with antigen Nature. 1989; 342 :559-561 Crossref Scopus (916) PubMed Google Scholar ) to express Cas9 in antigen-specific CD8 + T cells. The Cas9 expressing mice were fully backcrossed to the C57BL/6 background. T cell-specific deletion of Pofut1 was generated by breeding Cd4 Cre mice with Pofut1 fl/fl mice ( Stahl et al., 2008 73. Stahl, M. ∙ Uemura, K. ∙ Ge, C. ... Roles of Pofut1 and O-fucose in mammalian Notch signaling J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283 :13638-13651 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (155) PubMed Google Scholar ). To generate T cell specific deletion of Slc38a2 , the Slc38a2 tm1a(KOMP)Wtsi mutant mouse line (INFRAFRONTIER/EMMA) was bred with FLP1 recombinase transgenic mice (The Jackson Laboratory) and then with Cd4 Cre mice. All mice were housed in specific-pathogen-free conditions in the Animal Resource Center at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. Experiments and procedures were performed in accordance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.
For adoptive transfer of naive P14 cells, a total of 5 × 10 3 cells were transferred intravenously (i.v.) into naive mice. For adoptive transfer of retrovirus-transduced antigen-specific cells, a total of 1 − 2 × 10 4 [for experiments at day ≥5 post-infection (p.i.)] or 1.5 × 10 6 (for experiments at day 2.5 p.i.) were adoptively transferred i.v. into naive mice. We applied both single-color and dual-color transfer systems to derive discrete functional effects, e.g., for therapeutic effects via the single-color and cell-intrinsic effects via the dual-color transfer systems. Specifically, in the single-color transfer system, antigen-specific T cells transduced with sgNTC or the indicated sgRNAs, with the same fluorescent reporter protein, were transferred to separate hosts. In the dual-color transfer system, cells transduced with the indicated sgRNAs marked by the expression of Ametrine, were mixed at a 1:1 ratio with those transduced with sgNTC labeled with GFP or mCherry (called "spike"), followed by adoptive transfer to the same host. To calculate fold changes in the dual-color transfer system, the proportion of sgRNA-transduced cells were divided by the proportion of "spike" cells. In the panels that included the quantification of cell numbers from the dual-color transfer system, we presented the number of indicated sgRNA-transduced cells and that of the "spike" cells (sgNTC) from the same host. Unless otherwise noted, for long-term experiments (day > 30 p.i.), antigen-specific cells were transferred to Cas9-expressing naive hosts to minimize the potential rejection. For pathogen-induced infections, 2 × 10 5 plaque-forming units (PFU) of LCMV Armstrong strain virus (LCMV-Arm) or 3 × 10 4 clone-forming units (CFU) of Listeria monocytogenes expressing ovalbumin (OVA; Lm-OVA) were injected intraperitoneally or i.v., respectively. To evaluate T MEM recall responses, 5 × 10 3 splenic T MEM cells were sorted and transferred to naive C57BL/6 hosts and re-challenged with 2 × 10 5 PFU of LCMV-Arm or 5 × 10 4 CFU of Lm-OVA one day after T MEM transfer. The recall responses were analyzed at day 6 after re-challenge. In indicated experiments, 2 × 10 6 PFU of LCMV clone 13 were administrated i.v. to host mice that were previously infected with LCMV-Arm at day > 30 prior.
sgNTC- or sg Pofut1 -transduced OT-1 cells (1 × 10 4 ) were transferred to naive C57BL/6 mice (7–10 weeks of age) followed by 3 × 10 4 CFU of Lm-OVA infection. At day > 30 p.i., B16-OVA cells (1 × 10 7 ) were injected subcutaneously into above mice. Tumors were measured every three days with a digital caliper, and tumor volumes were calculated by the formula: length × width × [(length × width) 0.5 ] × π/6 as previously described ( Wei et al., 2019 78. Wei, J. ∙ Long, L. ∙ Zheng, W. ... Targeting REGNASE-1 programs long-lived effector T cells for cancer therapy Nature. 2019; 576 :471-476 Crossref Scopus (250) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mice were euthanized at humane endpoints when tumors reached 15 mm in the longest dimension.
In vivo killing assay was performed as previously described ( Kim et al., 2014 41. Kim, M.V. ∙ Ouyang, W. ∙ Liao, W. ... Murine in vivo CD8(+) T Cell Killing Assay Biol. Protoc. 2014; 4 :e1172 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, CD45.1 + splenocytes were pulsed with 1 μg/ml of OVA 257–264 peptide or gp33 peptide or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 37°C for 1 h. These antigen- or PBS-pulsed splenocytes were then labeled with 0.5 μM of CellTrace Violet (CTV lo ) (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or 5 μM of CellTrace Violet (CTV hi ), respectively, at 37°C for 15 min. The CTV lo and CTV hi labeled splenocytes were mixed at a 1:1 ratio and a total of 1 × 10 7 cells were transferred to host mice that were challenged with Lm-OVA or LCMV at day > 35 prior, followed by analysis of in vivo cytotoxicity against these splenocytes after 2.5 h.
Mixed bone marrow (BM) chimeras were constructed by mixing BM cells from CD45.2 + Cd4 Cre Pofut1 wt or Cd4 Cre Pofut1 fl/fl mice and CD45.1 + "spike" mice at a 1:1 ratio, followed by injection into sub-lethally irradiated Rag1 –/– recipient mice. Mice were analyzed at 7–8 weeks after reconstitution.
Naive Cas9-expressing P14 or OT-1 cells were isolated from the spleen and peripheral lymph nodes (pLN) of Cas9-P14 or Cas9-OT-1 mice by magnetic bead purification using a naive CD8α + T cell isolation kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Miltenyi Biotech). Purified naive P14 or OT-1 cells were activated in vitro for 18 h with plate-bound anti-CD3 (10 μg/ml; Bio-X-Cell) and anti-CD28 (5 μg/ml; Bio-X-Cell) antibodies. Viral transduction was performed by spin-infection at 900 g at 25°C for 3 h with 10 μg/ml polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich) followed by 3 h rest at 37°C and 5% CO 2 . Cells were washed and cultured with mouse IL-7 (12.5 ng/ml; Peprotech) and IL-15 (25 ng/ml; PeproTech) for 4 days. Cells were sorted based on the expression of fluorescent proteins using a Reflection cell sorter (iCyt) before adoptive transfer to recipients. sgRNAs were designed by using the following principles. For the genes that were included in our metabolic library, we routinely chose two guides with the highest levels of enrichment in our primary screening. For other genes (e.g., Fcsk ) that were not included in our metabolic library, we designed at least two independent guides (using the platform from Broad Institute https://portals.broadinstitute.org/gpp/public/analysis-tools/sgrna-design ) for phenotypic analyses. We verified that at least two guides induced similar phenotypes. sgRNAs used in this study were listed in Table S7 .
The lentiviral sgRNA vector was previously described ( Wei et al., 2019 78. Wei, J. ∙ Long, L. ∙ Zheng, W. ... Targeting REGNASE-1 programs long-lived effector T cells for cancer therapy Nature. 2019; 576 :471-476 Crossref Scopus (250) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, the EF-1α PuroR fragment of the lentiGuide-puro vector was replaced with a mouse PGK promoter-driven Ametrine (or GFP or mCherry) fluorescent protein. The retroviral sgRNA vector was generated from previously described pLMPd-Amt vector ( Chen et al., 2014 11. Chen, R. ∙ Bélanger, S. ∙ Frederick, M.A. ... In vivo RNA interference screens identify regulators of antiviral CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell differentiation Immunity. 2014; 41 :325-338 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (91) PubMed Google Scholar ) by replacing the miR30 shRNA cassette with the U6 promoter driven gRNA cassette that was from the lentiGuide-puro vector.
A custom mouse metabolic library containing 3,017 genes was synthesized based on the gene list from reported human metabolic genes ( Birsoy et al., 2015 6. Birsoy, K. ∙ Wang, T. ∙ Chen, W.W. ... An Essential Role of the Mitochondrial Electron Transport Chain in Cell Proliferation Is to Enable Aspartate Synthesis Cell. 2015; 162 :540-551 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (915) PubMed Google Scholar ). A total of 6 gRNAs were designed for each gene according to previously published criteria ( Sanson et al., 2018 66. Sanson, K.R. ∙ Hanna, R.E. ∙ Hegde, M. ... Optimized libraries for CRISPR-Cas9 genetic screens with multiple modalities Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :5416 Crossref Scopus (424) PubMed Google Scholar ). Two sub-libraries (AAAQ05 and AAAR07; Table S8 ) were made, with each containing 3 gRNAs targeting one gene and 500 non-targeting controls. The synthesis, purification and quality control of the library was described previously ( Wei et al., 2019 78. Wei, J. ∙ Long, L. ∙ Zheng, W. ... Targeting REGNASE-1 programs long-lived effector T cells for cancer therapy Nature. 2019; 576 :471-476 Crossref Scopus (250) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The in vivo screening approach was modified based on previous studies ( Chen et al., 2014 11. Chen, R. ∙ Bélanger, S. ∙ Frederick, M.A. ... In vivo RNA interference screens identify regulators of antiviral CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell differentiation Immunity. 2014; 41 :325-338 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (91) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wei et al., 2019 78. Wei, J. ∙ Long, L. ∙ Zheng, W. ... Targeting REGNASE-1 programs long-lived effector T cells for cancer therapy Nature. 2019; 576 :471-476 Crossref Scopus (250) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, lentivirus was produced by co-transfecting the lentiviral metabolic library plasmids, psPAX2, and pCAG4-Eco in HEK293T cells. At 48 h after transfection, the supernatant was harvested and frozen at −80°C. Naive Cas9-expressing P14 cells were isolated and pooled from 11 Cas9-P14 mice and transduced at a MOI of 0.3 to achieve ∼20% transduction efficiency immediately after T cell purification. After viral transduction, cells were activated with plate-bound anti-CD3 (10 μg/ml; Bio-X-Cell) and anti-CD28 (5 μg/ml; Bio-X-Cell) antibodies for 2 days and cultured with human IL-2 (100 IU/ml; Peprotech), mouse IL-7 (2.5 ng/ml; Peprotech) and IL-15 (25 ng/ml; Peprotech) for 4 days to expand and allow gene editing to occur. Transduced cells were sorted based on the expression of Ametrine, and an aliquot of 5 × 10 6 transduced P14 cells was saved as “day 0 input” (around 500 × cell coverage per sgRNA). Transduced P14 cells (0.75 × 10 6 ) were then transferred i.v. to naive C57BL/6 mice followed by LCMV-Arm infection (2 × 10 5 PFU) 2 h later. A total of 60 recipients were randomly divided into 3 groups as biological replicates. At day 7.5 after infection, donor-derived TE (KLRG1 + CD127 − ) and MP (KLRG1 − CD127 + ) cells were sorted and frozen at −80°C until genomic DNA extraction. A minimum of 2.4 × 10 6 P14 cells per sample (>240 × cell coverage per sgRNA) was recovered for further analysis.
Genomic DNA was extracted by using the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kits (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Subsequent primary PCR was performed by using the KOD Hot Start DNA Polymerase (Sigma-Aldrich). Primer sequences to amplify sgRNAs for the first PCR were:
Nextera NGS-F: TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGTTGTGGAAAGGACGAAACACCG; Nextera NGS-R: GTCTCGTGGGCTCGGAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGCCACTTTTTCAAGTTGATAACGG. PCR products were then purified using AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter). A second PCR was performed to attach Illumina adaptors and indexes to barcode samples. The library sequencing (Illumina) was performed in Hi-seq (Illumina) platform.
A total of 1 × 10 5 donor-derived P14 cells were sorted and RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Micro Kit (QIAGEN) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The RNA Integrity Number (RIN) and concentration of RNA were measured by Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer. RNA (1 ng) was used for subsequent microarray analysis with Clariom S mouse array platform (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
To perform quantitative real-time PCR analysis, cDNA was synthesized from the RNA generated above using SuperScript® III First-Strand Synthesis System (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The cDNA was then diluted and added to Power SYBR Green Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) containing specific PCR primers and gene amplification was assessed using an Applied Biosystems 7900HT quantitative PCR machine.
A total of 5 × 10 4 sgNTC- or sg Pofut1 -transduced P14 cells were incubated in 50 μL ATAC-seq lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl 2 , 0.1% IGEPAL CA-630) on ice. After 10 min, samples were centrifuged at 500 g for 10 min at 4°C to pellet nuclei. The supernatant was carefully removed, and the pellet was resuspended in 50 μL transposase reaction mix (25 μL 2 × TD buffer, 22.5 μL nuclease-free water, and 2.5 μL transposase) (Illumina). The reaction was incubated for 30 min at 37°C to allow tagmentation occur. Following tagmentation, the DNA was immediately purified using the MinElute kit (QIAGEN). Nextera indexing of the tagmented DNA was run using the NEBNext HiFi kit (NEB) based on manufacturer’s instructions, and amplified for 5 cycles as described ( Buenrostro et al., 2013 7. Buenrostro, J.D. ∙ Giresi, P.G. ∙ Zaba, L.C. ... Transposition of native chromatin for fast and sensitive epigenomic profiling of open chromatin, DNA-binding proteins and nucleosome position Nat. Methods. 2013; 10 :1213-1218 Crossref Scopus (4008) PubMed Google Scholar ). PCR product (5 μl) from above reaction was then used for a quantitative PCR (KAPA SYBRFast system; Kapa Biosystems) to determine the remaining number of PCR cycles required (as determined by the cycle number of each sample when it reaches 1/3 the fluorescence threshold). The remaining 45 μL of PCR reaction was then amplified in the same reaction mix using the optimal cycle number (20 cycles) on an Applied Biosystems 7900HT quantitative PCR machine. The PCR products were purified using AMPure XP beads followed by two 70% (v/v) ethanol washes, and elution of DNA in buffer EB (QIAGEN). Each sample was quantified in using a tapestation (Agilent) and then sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq to a sequencing depth of 300 million reads per sample.
P14 cells transduced with sgNTC (GFP + "spike" cells) or sg Pofut1 (Ametrine + ) and P14 cells transduced with empty vector (Ametrine + "spike" cells) or pMIGII-NICD (GFP + ) were transferred at a 1:1 ratio to naive mice that were subsequently infected with LCMV and sorted from spleen at day 7 p.i. Sorted cells were spun down at 2,000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was removed, and cells were resuspended and diluted in 1× PBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific) containing 0.04% BSA (Amresco) at concentration of 1 × 10 6 cells/ml. Single cell libraries were prepared using the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3′ v3.1 kit (10X Genomics). Briefly, the single-cell suspensions were loaded onto the Chromium Controller according to their respective cell counts to generate 9,000 single-cell gel beads in emulsion (GEMs) per sample. Each sample was loaded into a separate channel. The complementary DNA content of each sample after cDNA amplification of 11 cycles was quantified and quality checked using a high-sensitivity DNA chip in a tapestation (Agilent). 25% of cDNA from the previous step was used for fragmentation, end repair and A-tailing followed by adaptor ligation and PCR indexing. After library quantification and quality checking by tapestation (Agilent), samples were diluted and loaded onto the NovaSeq (Illumina) to a sequencing depth of 500 million reads per sample (approximately 50,000 reads per cell).
1 × 10 6 to 5 × 10 6 cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The desired amount of 4 × loading buffer was added into the cell lysate, and the samples were boiled at 100°C for 5 min. The resulting samples were loaded in 4%–12% Criterion XT Bis-Tris Protein gels and transferred to PVDF membrane. After blocking with 5% nonfat milk for 1 h, the membranes were incubated with primary antibodies for overnight. Membranes were washed 3 times with TBST and then incubated with 1:5,000 diluted HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (Promega) for 1 h. After washing 3 times with TBST, the membranes were exposed using enhanced chemiluminescence (Thermo Fisher Scientific) detection reagents and images were captured using the ODYSSEY Fc Analyzer (LI-COR).
Lung and liver were collected and minced into small pieces using razor blades. The organs were digested in dissociation buffer containing 1 mg/ml of collagenase IV (Worthington Biochemicals) and 0.5 mg/ml of DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37°C for 30 min with gentle rocking. The cell suspensions were then passed through 70-μm filters to remove undigested tissues followed by density-gradient centrifugation over Percoll (GE Healthcare).
Oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) were measured following the manufacturer’s instructions of Seahorse XF Cell Mito Stress Test Kit (Agilent). In brief, 2.5 × 10 5 donor-derived P14 cells were sorted and suspended in XF medium and then plated in a poly-L-lysine-coated XF96 plate. The OCR and ECAR under basal conditions and in response to 1 μM oligomycin, 1.5 μM fluoro-carbonylcyanidephenylhydrazone (FCCP) and 500 nM rotenone were measured using an XF96 Extracellular Flux Analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience).
Targeted amplicons were generated using gene-specific primers with partial Illumina adaptor overhangs and sequenced as previously described ( Sentmanat et al., 2018 71. Sentmanat, M.F. ∙ Peters, S.T. ∙ Florian, C.P. ... A Survey of Validation Strategies for CRISPR-Cas9 Editing Sci. Rep. 2018; 8 :888 Crossref Scopus (226) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, cell pellets of approximately 1 × 10 5 cells were lysed and used to generate gene-specific amplicons with partial Illumina adapters in the first round of PCR. Amplicons were indexed in a second round of PCR and pooled with other targeted amplicons for other loci to create sequence diversity. Additionally, 10% PhiX Sequencing Control V3 (Illumina) was added to the pooled amplicon library prior to running the sample on an Miseq Sequencer System (Illumina) to generate paired 2 × 250 bp reads. Samples were demultiplexed using the index sequences, fastq files were generated, and insertion and deletion (indel) mutation analysis was performed using CRIS.py ( Connelly and Pruett-Miller, 2019 14. Connelly, J.P. ∙ Pruett-Miller, S.M. CRIS.py: A Versatile and High-throughput Analysis Program for CRISPR-based Genome Editing Sci. Rep. 2019; 9 :4194 Crossref Scopus (87) PubMed Google Scholar ).
A total of 5 × 10 6 donor-derived P14 cells were sorted and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen after wash with ice-cold saline. The cell pellets were lysed with chloroform/methanol/water (3:4:1, v/v/v) and the hydrophilic fraction was extracted from upper aqueous phase followed by lyophilization. To measure GDP-fucose, the dried extracts were dissolved in 5% acetonitrile solution and then analyzed by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). In brief, liquid chromatography was performed using the Vanquish Horizon UHPLC system equipped with an Accucore C30 (50 × 2.1 mm, 2.6 μm) column (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Column temperature was maintained at 45°C and the mobile phases A consisted of water/acetonitrile (97:3, v/v) containing 10 mM ammonium acetate and 10 mM ammonium hydroxide. Acetonitrile was used as mobile phase B. The system was operated using the following linear gradient conditions: 0−0.5 min 2% B; 0.5−1.5 min 2 to 96% B; 1.5−2.5 min 96% B; 2.5−3.5 min 96 to 2% B; 3.5−5 min 2% B. The flow rate was 300 μl/min and the injection volume was 3 μl. Mass spectrometry analysis was performed under Q Exactive hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (QE-MS) system equipped with a HESI-II probe (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The detection was run in the negative ion mode using a targeted selected ion monitoring followed by a data-dependent MS/MS method (tSIM/dd-MS2). The QE-MS was operated at a resolution of 140,000 (FWHM, at m/z 200), AGC targeted of 1 × 10 6 and max injection time of 80 msec. The conditions for the dd-MS2 were as follows: a resolution of 35,000, AGC targeted of 1 × 10 5 , max injection time of 40 msec, MS2 isolation width 0.5 m/z and NCE 35. The source’s operating conditions were: Sheath gas flow 45, Aux gas flow 8, Sweep gas 1, Spray voltage 2.6 kV in negative ion mode, Capillary temp 325°C, S-lenses RF level 55 and Aux gas heater 325°C. Data were quantified using Xcalibur software (Thermo Fisher Scientific) after validation with authentic GDP-fucose standard (Sigma-Aldrich).
Naive CD8 + T cells from Cd4 Cre Slc38a2 wt and Cd4 Cre Slc38a2 fl/fl mice were stimulated with plate-bound anti-CD3 (10 μg/ml) and anti-CD28 (5 μg/ml) in the presence of IL-2 (100 IU/ml). After 24 h of stimulation, cells were either directly collected or incubated with medium containing 2 mM [U- 13 C]-glutamine for 10 min. The cells were washed once with ice-cold saline, and then polar metabolites were extracted and derivatized by acetonitrile. The intracellular glutamine or 13 C-glutamine [M+5] was analyzed with liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Data were quantified using Xcalibur software (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
For the analysis of surface markers, cells were stained in PBS containing 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS) for 20 min at room temperature. Transcription factor staining was performed using Foxp3/transcription factor staining buffers, according to the manufacturer’s instructions (eBioscience). GzmB (BioLegend) staining was followed by surface staining, fixation and permeabilization using a fixation/permeabilization kit (BD Biosciences). To examine intracellular cytokine production, splenocytes were stimulated with 0.5 μg/ml gp33 peptide in the presence of monensin (GolgiSTOP; BD Biosciences) for 5 h and stained with anti-IFN-γ (BioLegend) and anti-TNF-α (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using a fixation/permeabilization kit (BD Biosciences). Active caspase-3 staining was performed following the instructions of the Active Caspase-3 Apoptosis Kit (BD Biosciences). BrdU staining (pulsed for 18 h for days 6.5–7.5 analysis or 12 h for days 4.5–5 analysis) was performed with APC BrdU Flow Kit (BD Biosciences) per the manufacturer’s instructions. Fixable viability dye (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used for dead-cell exclusion. The following antibodies were used: anti-mouse CD3, anti-mouse CD44 (both from BD Biosciences); anti-mouse TCR-Vα2, anti-mouse Ki-67, anti-mouse CX3CR1, anti-mouse Bcl2, anti-mouse KLRG1, anti-mouse CXCR3, anti-mouse CD62L, anti-mouse Cat1 (encoded by Slc7a1 ) (all from BioLegend); anti-mouse TCF1 (Cell Signaling Technology); anti-mouse Thy-1.2, anti-mouse Thy-1.1, anti-mouse Foxp3, anti-mouse CD98, anti-mouse CD71, anti-mouse CD27, anti-mouse CD45.1, anti-mouse CD4 (all from Thermo Fisher Scientific); anti-mouse CD127, anti-mouse CD45.2, anti-mouse CD8α (all from Tonbo Biosciences). For measurement of ROS, mitochondrial mass and mitochondrial membrane potential, lymphocytes were incubated for 30 min at 37°C with medium containing surface markers and 10 μM CellROX Deep Red (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 10 nM Mito Tracker Deep Red (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and 20 nM TMRM (ImmunoChemistry Technologies), respectively. For detection of phosphorylated S6 (pS6) (S235/236) ex vivo , mice were euthanized and a small portion of spleen was collected and fixed immediately in 1× Lyse/Fix buffer (BD Biosciences) followed by preparation of a single-cell suspension. Permeabilization was achieved by incubation with ice-cold Perm III buffer (BD Biosciences) for 30 min and staining with antibody recognizing pS6 (S235/236) (Cell Signaling Technology). pS6 (S235/236) levels in peptide-stimulated lymphocytes was assessed by fixation in 1× Lyse/Fix buffer, followed by permeabilization by ice-cold Perm III buffer (BD Biosciences) and staining with anti-pS6 (S235/236). To perform tetramer staining, cells were stained in PBS containing 2% FBS with Db/gp33 tetramer (NIH Tetramer Core Facility) for 45 min followed by staining with additional surface antibodies for 30 min at room temperature. For flow cytometry analysis, the BD LSR II instrument was used, and data were analyzed with FlowJo 10.4.2 software (TreeStar). Unless otherwise noted, the spleen was used for all immune analyses.
For data analysis, raw FASTQ files obtained after sequencing were demultiplexed using the HiSeq Analysis software (Illumina), as described ( Wei et al., 2019 78. Wei, J. ∙ Long, L. ∙ Zheng, W. ... Targeting REGNASE-1 programs long-lived effector T cells for cancer therapy Nature. 2019; 576 :471-476 Crossref Scopus (250) PubMed Google Scholar ). Single-end reads were trimmed and quality-filtered using the CLC Genomics Workbench v.11 (QIAGEN) and matched against sgRNA sequences from the sgRNA metabolic library. Read counts for sgRNAs were normalized against total read counts across all samples. For each sgRNA, the fold change (FC; log 2 -transformed ratio) for enrichment was calculated between each of the biological replicates and the input experiment. After merging the quantification results from two sub-libraries, the FC of genes was calculated on the basis of the average enrichment of their six gene-specific sgRNAs. The gene-level false-discovery-rate (FDR)-adjusted p value was calculated among multiple sgRNAs (n = 6) of each gene, using a two-tailed paired Student’s t test between log 2 -transformed average normalized read counts of MP samples and those of TE samples, between counts of MP samples and those of input sample, or between counts of TE samples and those of input sample. The P value was further adjusted using Bonferroni correction with gene size. The FC and P value of 1,000 negative control sgRNAs were calculated accordingly.
To perform microarray analyses, the gene expression signals were summarized with the robust multi-array average algorithm (Affymetrix Expression Console v1.1). The differentially expressed gene analysis was performed using lmFit method implemented in R package limma v.3.34.9 ( Ritchie et al., 2015 61. Ritchie, M.E. ∙ Phipson, B. ∙ Wu, D. ... limma powers differential expression analyses for RNA-sequencing and microarray studies Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43 :e47 Crossref Scopus (21697) PubMed Google Scholar ). FDR was calculated by Benjamini–Hochberg method. The TE′, MP and T INT subset-specific genes were defined by selectively upregulated genes in each subset compared to the other two subsets using the R package limma v.3.34.9 ( Ritchie et al., 2015 61. Ritchie, M.E. ∙ Phipson, B. ∙ Wu, D. ... limma powers differential expression analyses for RNA-sequencing and microarray studies Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43 :e47 Crossref Scopus (21697) PubMed Google Scholar ). Principal component analysis was performed using R function prcomp. All the plots were generated using the R package ggplot2 v.2.2.1.
Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and functional gene set enrichment was performed as previously described ( Subramanian et al., 2005 74. Subramanian, A. ∙ Tamayo, P. ∙ Mootha, V.K. ... Gene set enrichment analysis: a knowledge-based approach for interpreting genome-wide expression profiles Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102 :15545-15550 Crossref Scopus (33572) PubMed Google Scholar ) using C7 immunological collections and Hallmark collections from the Molecular Signatures Database ( https://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/ ). Several gene sets that were frequently used in this study were renamed as follows: MP signature, “IL-7R low vs high eff CD8 T cell DN” ( Joshi et al., 2007 35. Joshi, N.S. ∙ Cui, W. ∙ Chandele, A. ... Inflammation directs memory precursor and short-lived effector CD8(+) T cell fates via the graded expression of T-bet transcription factor Immunity. 2007; 27 :281-295 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1421) PubMed Google Scholar ); TE signature, “IL-7R low vs high eff CD8 T cell UP” ( Joshi et al., 2007 35. Joshi, N.S. ∙ Cui, W. ∙ Chandele, A. ... Inflammation directs memory precursor and short-lived effector CD8(+) T cell fates via the graded expression of T-bet transcription factor Immunity. 2007; 27 :281-295 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1421) PubMed Google Scholar ); early-effector-like signatures, “Day 6 vs day 10 eff CD8 T cell UP” and “Day 6 vs day 10 Traf6KO eff CD8 T cell UP” ( Pearce et al., 2009 55. Pearce, E.L. ∙ Walsh, M.C. ∙ Cejas, P.J. ... Enhancing CD8 T-cell memory by modulating fatty acid metabolism Nature. 2009; 460 :103-107 Crossref Scopus (1255) PubMed Google Scholar ); and cell cycle-related signatures, “Hallmark E2F targets” and “Hallmark G2M checkpoint.”
ATAC-seq analysis was performed by following pipelines previously described ( Karmaus et al., 2019 39. Karmaus, P.W.F. ∙ Chen, X. ∙ Lim, S.A. ... Metabolic heterogeneity underlies reciprocal fates of T H 17 cell stemness and plasticity Nature. 2019; 565 :101-105 Crossref Scopus (138) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wei et al., 2019 78. Wei, J. ∙ Long, L. ∙ Zheng, W. ... Targeting REGNASE-1 programs long-lived effector T cells for cancer therapy Nature. 2019; 576 :471-476 Crossref Scopus (250) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, 2 × 50-bp paired-end reads obtained from NovaSeq were trimming for Nextera adaptor by trimmomatic (v0.36, paired-end mode, with parameter LEADING:10 TRAILING:10 SLIDINGWINDOW:4:18 MINLEN:25) and aligned to mouse genome mm9 downloaded from gencode release M1 ( https://www.gencodegenes.org/mouse/releases.html ) by BWA (version 0.7.16, default parameters) ( Li and Durbin, 2009 45. Li, H. ∙ Durbin, R. Fast and accurate short read alignment with Burrows-Wheeler transform Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :1754-1760 Crossref Scopus (32751) PubMed Google Scholar ). Duplicated reads were then marked with Picard (v2.9.4) and only non-duplicated proper paired reads have been kept by samtools (parameter ‘-q 1 -F 1804’ v1.9) ( Li et al., 2009 46. Li, H. ∙ Handsaker, B. ∙ Wysoker, A. ..., 1000 Genome Project Data Processing Subgroup The Sequence Alignment/Map format and SAMtools Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :2078-2079 Crossref Scopus (38834) PubMed Google Scholar ). After adjustment of Tn5 shift (reads were offset by +4-bp for the sense strand and −5-bp for the antisense strand), we separated reads into nucleosome-free, mononucleosome, dinucleosome and trinucleosome (as previously described) ( Buenrostro et al., 2013 7. Buenrostro, J.D. ∙ Giresi, P.G. ∙ Zaba, L.C. ... Transposition of native chromatin for fast and sensitive epigenomic profiling of open chromatin, DNA-binding proteins and nucleosome position Nat. Methods. 2013; 10 :1213-1218 Crossref Scopus (4008) PubMed Google Scholar ) by fragment size and generated .bigwig files by using the center 80-bp of fragments and scaled to 30 × 10 6 nucleosome-free reads. We observed reasonable nucleosome-free peaks and a pattern of mono-, di- and tri-nucleosomes on IGV (v2.4.13) ( Robinson et al., 2011 62. Robinson, J.T. ∙ Thorvaldsdóttir, H. ∙ Winckler, W. ... Integrative genomics viewer Nat. Biotechnol. 2011; 29 :24-26 Crossref Scopus (9419) PubMed Google Scholar ). All samples in this study had approximately 15 × 10 6 nucleosome-free reads, indicative of good data quality. Next, peaks were called on nucleosome-free reads by MACS2 (v2.1.1.20160309, with default parameters with ‘–extsize 200–nomodel’) ( Zhang et al., 2008 83. Zhang, Y. ∙ Liu, T. ∙ Meyer, C.A. ... Model-based analysis of ChIP-Seq (MACS) Genome Biol. 2008; 9 :R137 Crossref Scopus (10883) PubMed Google Scholar ). To assure replicability, we first finalized nucleosome-free regions for each sample and retained a peak only if it called with a higher cut-off (MACS2 -q 0.05). We further generated consensus peaks for each group by keeping peaks that were present in at least 50% of the replicates and discarding the remaining, non-reproducible peaks. The reproducible peaks were further merged between sgNTC- and sg Pofut1 -transduced samples if they overlapped by 100-bp and then nucleosome-free reads from each of the eight samples was counted using bedtools (v.2.25.0) ( Quinlan and Hall, 2010 59. Quinlan, A.R. ∙ Hall, I.M. BEDTools: a flexible suite of utilities for comparing genomic features Bioinformatics. 2010; 26 :841-842 Crossref Scopus (15098) PubMed Google Scholar ). To identify the differentially accessible open chromatin regions (OCRs), we first normalized raw nucleosome-free read counts per million (CPM) followed by differential accessibility analysis by implementation of the negative binomial model in the DESeq2 R package ( Love et al., 2014 48. Love, M.I. ∙ Huber, W. ∙ Anders, S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2 Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :550 Crossref Scopus (48397) PubMed Google Scholar ). FDR-corrected P value < 0.05 and |log 2 FC| > 0.5 were used as cut-offs for more- or less-accessible regions in sg Pofut1 -transduced samples compared to their sgNTC-transduced "spike" cells. Principal component analysis was performed using function prcomp in R. We then assigned the differentially accessible OCRs in the ATAC-seq data for the nearest genes to generate a list of DA genes using HOMER ( Heinz et al., 2010 28. Heinz, S. ∙ Benner, C. ∙ Spann, N. ... Simple combinations of lineage-determining transcription factors prime cis-regulatory elements required for macrophage and B cell identities Mol. Cell. 2010; 38 :576-589 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (8020) PubMed Google Scholar ). Functional peak set enrichment was then performed in C7 immunological collection using those DA genes.
For motif analysis ( Karmaus et al., 2019 39. Karmaus, P.W.F. ∙ Chen, X. ∙ Lim, S.A. ... Metabolic heterogeneity underlies reciprocal fates of T H 17 cell stemness and plasticity Nature. 2019; 565 :101-105 Crossref Scopus (138) PubMed Google Scholar ), we further selected 1,000 unchanged regions log 2 FC < 0.05 and FDR-corrected p value > 0.5 as control regions. FIMO from MEME suite (v4.11.3, ‘–thresh 1e-4–motif-pseudo 0.0001’) ( Bailey et al., 2009 5. Bailey, T.L. ∙ Boden, M. ∙ Buske, F.A. ... MEME SUITE: tools for motif discovery and searching Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37 W202-8 Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar ) was used for scanning motifs (TRANSFAC database release 2019, only included Vertebrata and not 3D structure-based) matches in the nucleosome-free regions and two-tailed Fisher’s exact test was used to determine whether a motif was significantly enriched in differentially accessible compared to the control regions. To perform footprinting analysis of transcription-factor binding site analysis, the RGT HINT application was used to infer transcription factor activity and to plot the results ( Li et al., 2019 47. Li, Z. ∙ Schulz, M.H. ∙ Look, T. ... Identification of transcription factor binding sites using ATAC-seq Genome Biol. 2019; 20 :45 Crossref Scopus (248) PubMed Google Scholar ).
scRNA-seq data, either from a public dataset of P14 cells isolated at day 8 after LCMV-Arm infection (GSM3785518) ( Chen et al., 2019 12. Chen, Z. ∙ Ji, Z. ∙ Ngiow, S.F. ... TCF-1-Centered Transcriptional Network Drives an Effector versus Exhausted CD8 T Cell-Fate Decision Immunity. 2019; 51 :840-855.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (376) PubMed Google Scholar ) or from sgNTC- and sg Pofut1 -transduced P14 cells or from empty vector and pMIGII-NICD transduced P14 cells at day 7 after LCMV-Arm infection, were pre-processed using Cell Ranger (10X Genomics) software and Seurat R package (v3.1.2) ( Butler et al., 2018 8. Butler, A. ∙ Hoffman, P. ∙ Smibert, P. ... Integrating single-cell transcriptomic data across different conditions, technologies, and species Nat. Biotechnol. 2018; 36 :411-420 Crossref Scopus (6218) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, the Cell Ranger 1.3 Single-Cell software suite (10X Genomics) was implemented to process the raw sequencing data from the Illumina NovaSeq run. This pipeline performed demultiplexing alignment (using the mouse genome mm10 from ENSEMBL GRCm38) and barcode processing to generate gene–cell matrices used for downstream analysis. Cells with low unique molecular identifiers (UMI) counts (potentially dead cells with broken membranes) or high UMI counts (potentially two or more cells in a single droplet) were removed from the subsequent analysis. Cells with high percent (> 4%) of mitochondrial reads were also removed. We normalized the expression level of each gene using regularized negative binomial regression with sctransform R package (v0.2.1) ( Hafemeister and Satija, 2019 22. Hafemeister, C. ∙ Satija, R. Normalization and variance stabilization of single-cell RNA-seq data using regularized negative binomial regression Genome Biol. 2019; 20 :296 Crossref Scopus (1785) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To identify different clusters among the P14 cells, data were further analyzed using Seurat and visualized by UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) ( McInnes et al., 2018 51. McInnes, L. ∙ Healy, J. ∙ Melville, J. UMAP: uniform manifold approximation and projection for dimension reduction arXiv. 2018; arXiv:1802.03426 Google Scholar ) after regressing out cell cycle effects during data scaling, which partitioned cells into three clusters based on their transcriptomes. Non-parametric Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to compare the gene expression of cells in each cluster (versus cells in the other two clusters) and then genes in each comparison were ranked based on their log 2 FC. To identify the enriched pathways in each cluster, pre-ranked GSEA ( Korotkevich et al., 2019 42. Korotkevich, G. ∙ Sukhov, V. ∙ Sergushichev, A. Fast gene set enrichment analysis bioRxiv. 2019; Crossref Google Scholar ), an analysis of GSEA against a user-supplied, ranked list of genes, was then performed with the C7 immunological collection using fGSEA R package (v1.10.1) for each comparison. Curated violin plots that represent the expression level of genes were generated by VlnPlot function in Seurat R package. The activity of Pofut1-dependent signature [defined by downregulated genes from microarrays in sg Pofut1 - compared to sgNTC-transduced P14 cells isolated at day 7.5 p.i.; FDR < 0.05; log 2 FC (sg Pofut1 /sgNTC) < –0.5)] was calculated using method AUCell ( Aibar et al., 2017 2. Aibar, S. ∙ González-Blas, C.B. ∙ Moerman, T. ... SCENIC: single-cell regulatory network inference and clustering Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :1083-1086 Crossref Scopus (2530) PubMed Google Scholar ) and color-coded (from low to high, blue–red) on the UMAP visualization.
To perform the RNA velocity analysis, the spliced and unspliced reads were recounted by the velocyto Python package based on previous aligned bam files of scRNA-seq data ( La Manno et al., 2018 43. La Manno, G. ∙ Soldatov, R. ∙ Zeisel, A. ... RNA velocity of single cells Nature. 2018; 560 :494-498 Crossref Scopus (1950) PubMed Google Scholar ). The calculation of RNA velocity values for each gene in each cell and embedding RNA velocity vector to low-dimension space were performed using velocyto.R pipeline. We estimated RNA velocity using the gene-relative model, with k = 50 cell kNN pooling and using top/bottom 2% quantiles for gamma fit. The velocity was visualized on the UMAP embedding with the show.velocity.on.embedding.cor function.
For biological experiment (non-omics) analyses, data were analyzed using Prism 7 software (GraphPad) by two-tailed paired Student’s t test (when comparing to the co-transferred "spike" cells) or two-tailed unpaired Student’s t test. Two-way ANOVA was performed for comparing tumor growth curves. The log-rank (Mantel–Cox) test was performed for comparing mouse survival curves. p < 0.05 was considered significant. In all bar plots, data are presented as mean ± s.e.m.
