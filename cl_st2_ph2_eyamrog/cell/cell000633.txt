Title: Generating human artery and vein cells from pluripotent stem cells highlights the arterial tropism of Nipah and Hendra viruses


Abstract: Summary

Stem cell research endeavors to generate specific subtypes of classically defined “cell types.” Here, we generate >90% pure human artery or vein endothelial cells from pluripotent stem cells within 3–4 days. We specified artery cells by inhibiting vein-specifying signals and vice versa. These cells modeled viral infection of human vasculature by Nipah and Hendra viruses, which are extraordinarily deadly (∼57%–59% fatality rate) and require biosafety-level-4 containment. Generating pure populations of artery and vein cells highlighted that Nipah and Hendra viruses preferentially infected arteries; arteries expressed higher levels of their viral-entry receptor. Virally infected artery cells fused into syncytia containing up to 23 nuclei, which rapidly died. Despite infecting arteries and occupying ∼6%–17% of their transcriptome, Nipah and Hendra largely eluded innate immune detection, minimally eliciting interferon signaling. We thus efficiently generate artery and vein cells, introduce stem-cell-based toolkits for biosafety-level-4 virology, and explore the arterial tropism and cellular effects of Nipah and Hendra viruses.

Section: Introduction

Endothelial cells (ECs)—the innermost constituents of blood vessels—pervade all tissues and have manifold roles in health and disease. In health, they control entry and exit of bloodborne nutrients, wastes, and immune cells to and from their client tissues ( Augustin and Koh, 2017 6. Augustin, H.G. ∙ Koh, G.Y.

In disease, ECs contribute to atherosclerosis and other afflictions that account for over half of human deaths ( Augustin and Koh, 2017 6. Augustin, H.G. ∙ Koh, G.Y.

Many risk-group-4 viruses cause deadly vascular diseases, are among the most lethal human pathogens known, and require biosafety-level-4 (BSL4) containment ( CDC and NIH, 2020 15. CDC, NIH Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories United States Department of Health and Human Services, 2020 Google Scholar ). Here, we focus on Nipah and Hendra viruses, which respectively cause outbreaks throughout Asia (∼59% fatality rate) and Australia (∼57% fatality rate), and are risk-group-4 paramyxoviruses in the genus Henipavirus ( Ang et al., 2018 3.

A morbillivirus that caused fatal disease in horses and humans Science. 1995; 268 :94-97 Crossref Scopus (565) PubMed Google Scholar ). Individual Nipah virus outbreaks epidemiologically vary due to viral variants and other factors: the 1999 Malaysian and 2018 Indian outbreaks, respectively, exhibited fatality rates of ∼40% and ∼91% ( Ang et al., 2018 3.

Dis. 2019; 219 :1867-1878 Crossref Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ). Of exigent concern, no treatments or vaccines for either Nipah or Hendra are presently approved for human use, and these diseases are thus classified priority diseases by the World Health Organization ( Gómez Román et al., 2022 42.

To understand the enigmatic vascular diseases caused by risk-group-4 viruses, we must precisely map their target cells and effects on such cells. This pursuit has been complicated by unique constraints of BSL4 experimentation and inadequate experimental systems.
A challenge in studying ECs is that they encompass multiple subtypes—including artery, vein, capillary, and lymphatic ECs—which are molecularly distinct and subserve different physiological functions ( De Val and Black, 2009 27.

Pathol. 2002; 161 :2153-2167 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (283) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, whether different EC subtypes harbor distinct functions in viral diseases remains enigmatic. Artery ECs express higher levels of EFNB2 ( Chong et al., 2011 18. Chong, D.C. ∙ Koo, Y. ∙ Xu, K. ... Stepwise arteriovenous fate acquisition during mammalian vasculogenesis Dev.

Bonaparte, M.I. ∙ Dimitrov, A.S. ∙ Bossart, K.N. ... Ephrin-B2 ligand is a functional receptor for Hendra virus and Nipah virus Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

EphrinB2 is the entry receptor for Nipah virus, an emergent deadly paramyxovirus Nature. 2005; 436 :401-405 Crossref Scopus (347) PubMed Google Scholar )—leading to the hypothesis that these viruses might preferentially infect artery ECs. Nevertheless, both artery and vein ECs can reportedly be infected by Nipah and Hendra in vitro ( Aljofan et al., 2009 1. Aljofan, M. ∙ Saubern, S. ∙ Meyer, A.G. ... Characteristics of Nipah virus and Hendra virus replication in different cell lines and their suitability for antiviral screening Virus Res. 2009; 142 :92-99 Crossref Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lo et al., 2010 64.

J. 2014; 11 :200 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ). Yet, an important proviso is that current systems to culture ECs do not preserve arteriovenous identity: primary ECs originally isolated from arteries or veins rapidly relinquish their arteriovenous subtype identity in vitro ( Aranguren et al., 2013 4. Aranguren, X.L. ∙ Agirre, X. ∙ Beerens, M. ... Unraveling a novel transcription factor code determining the human arterial-specific endothelial cell signature Blood. 2013; 122 :3982-3992 Crossref Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar ). This technical limitation has obscured viral tropism for, and their effects on, specific EC subtypes.
Generating well-defined populations of human artery versus vein ECs en masse would empower us to explore viral infection of the vasculature, and in particular which EC subtype(s) are infected. Differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs, including embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells) into specific cell types (e.g., ECs) is rapidly advancing, yet generating pure populations of desired cellular “subtypes” (e.g., artery and vein ECs) remains quite challenging ( Fowler et al., 2019 37. Fowler, J.L. ∙ Ang, L.T. ∙ Loh, K.M. A critical look: challenges in differentiating human pluripotent stem cells into desired cell types and organoids Wiley Interdiscip. Rev.: Dev. Biol. 2019; 113 891–823 Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar ). Starting from pluripotent cells, we must map the branching lineage choices through which they differentiate into cellular subtypes and the extracellular signals that control each step in their journey. Extant protocols often differentiate hPSCs toward mesoderm using BMP, FGF, TGF-β, and/or WNT and then bias differentiation toward ECs using VEGF and other signals. However, these signals are also permissive for the formation of other mesodermal lineages; consequently, a heterogeneous population containing a subset of ECs usually arises (e.g., Halaidych et al., 2018 44.

On the other hand, overexpression of pan-endothelial transcription factor (TF) ETV2 efficiently differentiates hPSCs into ECs, but they are also apparently bereft of arterial or venous identity ( Ng et al., 2020 82.

However, the challenges in generating artery and vein ECs in vitro indicate gaps in our understanding of how these subtypes developmentally arise and intimate that additional signals for arteriovenous specification may exist.
Here, we chart a developmental roadmap for the stepwise diversification of hPSCs into primitive streak, lateral mesoderm, and subsequently into artery and vein ECs. At each step of differentiation, we reveal the extracellular signals that need to be activated, and those that must be simultaneously inhibited to prevent emergence of undesired cell types. We created >90% pure populations of either human artery or vein ECs within 3–4 days of hPSC differentiation. We then applied these well-defined artery and vein EC populations to BSL4 virology: Nipah and Hendra viruses preferentially targeted hPSC-derived artery ECs. More broadly, hPSC-derived cell types will provide a powerful platform to explore the biology of, and countermeasures against, risk-group-4 viruses under BSL4 containment.

Section: Results

Starting from hPSCs in vitro , we sought to emulate the stepwise in vivo development of pluripotent cells (corresponding to day 5.5 of mouse embryonic development [∼E5.5]) into primitive streak (∼E6.5), lateral mesoderm (∼E7–7.5), and finally artery (∼E8.25) and vein ECs (∼E9.0) ( Figure 1 A; Chong et al., 2011 18. Chong, D.C. ∙ Koo, Y. ∙ Xu, K. ... Stepwise arteriovenous fate acquisition during mammalian vasculogenesis Dev. Dyn. 2011; 240 :2153-2165 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ). First, activating BMP, FGF, TGF-β and WNT for 24 h differentiated hPSCs into 97.3% ± 0.3% pure MIXL1-GFP + mid primitive streak while suppressing ectoderm formation ( Figure 1 B; Loh et al., 2016 66. Loh, K.M. ∙ Chen, A. ∙ Koh, P.W. ... Mapping the pairwise choices leading from pluripotency to human bone, heart, and other mesoderm cell types Cell. 2016; 166 :451-467 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (215) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Second, we further differentiated hPSC-derived day 1 mid primitive streak into day 2 lateral mesoderm, which contains endothelial progenitors in vivo ( Ciau-Uitz et al., 2013 21. Ciau-Uitz, A. ∙ Pinheiro, P. ∙ Kirmizitas, A. ... VEGFA-dependent and -independent pathways synergise to drive Scl expression and initiate programming of the blood stem cell lineage in Xenopus Development. 2013; 140 :2632-2642 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). We induced lateral mesoderm markers SCL , LMO2 , and FLI1 by (1) activating BMP, VEGF, and PKA, while (2) simultaneously inhibiting WNT, TGF-β, and PI3K to repress formation of unwanted paraxial mesoderm and endoderm ( Loh et al., 2014 65.

We thus generate lateral mesoderm prior to generating ECs.
Subsequently, we identified the signals that controlled the further segregation of hPSC-derived day 2 lateral mesoderm into artery, vein, or heart lineages ( Figure 2 A). To differentiate lateral mesoderm toward ECs, we (1) activated VEGF, while (2) simultaneously inhibiting BMP and WNT, which respectively induced NKX2.5 + heart precursors ( Loh et al., 2016 66. Loh, K.M. ∙ Chen, A. ∙ Koh, P.W. ...

Having inhibited formation of non-ECs, next we screened for signals that induce arterial marker SOX17 ( Corada et al., 2013 22. Corada, M. ∙ Orsenigo, F. ∙ Morini, M.F. ...

Additional signals (TGF-β and PI3K) controlled the bifurcation of day-2 lateral mesoderm into artery versus vein fates: TGF-β specified arteries, whereas PI3K conversely induced veins ( Figures 2 B and S2 bii–S2biv). Consequently, we efficiently generated artery ECs by (1) inducing arterial fate through TGF-β activation, while (2) repressing vein formation by simultaneously inhibiting PI3K ( Ditadi et al., 2015 29. Ditadi, A. ∙ Sturgeon, C.M. ∙ Tober, J. ... Human definitive haemogenic endothelium and arterial vascular endothelium represent distinct lineages Nat.

Activation of the arterial program drives development of definitive hemogenic endothelium with lymphoid potential Cell Rep. 2018; 23 :2467-2481 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ). While previous protocols to putatively generate hPSC-derived artery ECs inhibited TGF-β ( Zhang et al., 2017 126. Zhang, J. ∙ Chu, L.-F. ∙ Hou, Z. ... Functional characterization of human pluripotent stem cell-derived arterial endothelial cells. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of The United States of America 2017 201702295 Crossref Google Scholar ), we found that TGF-β inhibition in fact blocked artery specification and instead induced venous marker NR2F2 ( Figures 2 B and S2 Bii). This thus disclosed a temporally dynamic role for TGF-β signaling in specifying arterial fate, changing every 24 h across 3 days of hPSC differentiation. TGF-β had to be initially activated (inducing primitive streak, day 1), then inhibited (specifying lateral mesoderm, day 2), and later re-activated (to induce arterial fate, day 3) ( Figure 2 C).
Taken together, activation of TGF-β (to specify arteries) and VEGF (to specify ECs) together with simultaneous blockade of BMP, WNT, and PI3K for 24 h differentiated day-2 lateral mesoderm into day-3 artery ECs, while inhibiting unwanted differentiation into either heart or vein lineages ( Figure S2 D). This delineates a complex signaling code for arterial specification beyond activation of VEGF and NOTCH (reviewed by Coultas et al., 2005 23. Coultas, L. ∙ Chawengsaksophak, K. ∙ Rossant, J.

We generated SOX17 + CD144 + artery ECs within 3 days of hPSC differentiation ( Figure 2 C), which were >90% pure, as assayed using newly engineered SOX17-2A-mPlum reporter hPSCs ( Figure 2 D) and SOX17-mCherry hPSCs ( Figure S2 E). Artery differentiation was reproducible across 4 hESC and hiPSC lines, generating 97.9% ± 2.4% pure CD144 + DLL4 + arterial ECs within 3 days and was more efficient and rapid than 4 published differentiation protocols ( Lian et al., 2014 61.

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) reaffirmed the efficiency of artery differentiation. After 3 days of differentiation, 91.9% of the population formed a predominant artery EC cluster that expressed artery-specific ( SOX17 , CXCR4 , and DLL4 ) and pan-EC ( VE-CADHERIN , CD31 , and CD34 ) markers ( Figure 2 F), which was confirmed by qPCR ( Figures S2 H and S2I). Nevertheless, individual artery ECs varied in their cell-cycle status, as shown by MKI67 expression ( Figure 2 F). ECs were artery specific: they did not express venous marker NR2F2 ( Figure 2 F), consistent with our inhibition of vein-specifying signals (e.g., PI3K). This thus contrasts with past hPSC-derived ECs that co-expressed both arterial and venous markers ( Olmer et al., 2018 87. Olmer, R. ∙ Engels, L. ∙ Usman, A. ... Differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells into functional endothelial cells in scalable suspension culture Stem Cell Rep. 2018; 10 :1657-1672 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ; Paik et al., 2018 89. Paik, D.T. ∙ Tian, L. ∙ Lee, J. ... Large-scale single-cell RNA-seq reveals molecular signatures of heterogeneous populations of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived endothelial cells Circ. Res. 2018; 123 :443-450 Crossref Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, 8.1% of cells were non-ECs that expressed mesenchymal markers ( Figure 2 F). Taken together, activation of artery-inducing signals with simultaneous inhibition of vein-specifying signals efficiently generated hPSC-derived artery ECs, with scarce mesenchyme-like cells.
Attesting to their lineage fidelity, hPSC-derived artery ECs showed overall transcriptional similarity (R = 0.74) with in vivo artery ECs within 4-week-old human fetuses ( Zeng et al., 2019 125. Zeng, Y. ∙ He, J. ∙ Bai, Z. ... Tracing the first hematopoietic stem cell generation in human embryo by single-cell RNA sequencing Cell Res. 2019; 29 :881-894 Crossref Scopus (77) PubMed Google Scholar ) and expressed comparable levels of pan-EC and arterial markers ( Figure 2 G). This was promising, given that in vivo versus in vitro cells were not precisely matched in their genetic background or developmental stage. Genes that were differentially expressed by artery ECs in vivo and in vitro largely related to metabolism and protein translation ( Figure S2 J; Table S1 ), and as such, may reflect metabolic adaptation to cell culture. Additionally, ESM 1 —a VEGF-induced gene ( Shin et al., 2008 108. Shin, J.W. ∙ Huggenberger, R. ∙ Detmar, M. Transcriptional profiling of VEGF-A and VEGF-C target genes in lymphatic endothelium reveals endothelial-specific molecule-1 as a novel mediator of lymphangiogenesis Blood. 2008; 112 :2318-2326 Crossref Scopus (110) PubMed Google Scholar )—was higher in vitro ( Figure S2 J), perhaps reflecting VEGF levels in the media. Overall, hPSC-derived artery ECs are transcriptionally similar, but are not identical, to fetal artery ECs.
Having defined artery-specifying signals, next we asked what signals confer vein identity ( Figure 3 A). Starting from day 2 hPSC-derived lateral mesoderm, we dually inhibited the artery-specifying signals TGF-β and NOTCH to block arterial differentiation ( Figure 3 B). While NOTCH inhibition promotes venous fate ( Ditadi et al., 2015 29. Ditadi, A. ∙ Sturgeon, C.M. ∙ Tober, J. ...

Activation of the arterial program drives development of definitive hemogenic endothelium with lymphoid potential Cell Rep. 2018; 23 :2467-2481 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ), we found that NOTCH inhibition was not sufficient to efficiently induce vein ECs in vitro . We thus explored additional signals for vein specification.
We discovered that VEGF/ERK signaling had a temporally dynamic role in vein EC specification in vitro : on day 3, it had to be activated to generate ECs, whereas on day 4, it had to be inhibited to generate vein ECs ( Figure 3 C). ERK blockade on day 3 prevented EC specification ( Figure 3 C). Yet, after cells acquired EC identity by day 3, subsequently inhibiting ERK on day 4 did not impair EC identity but rather was critical to instruct vein fate ( Figure 3 C). Prolonged activation or inhibition of VEGF for 48 h did not yield vein ECs, illustrating the importance of temporal VEGF/ERK modulation in vitro ( Figure 3 C). Modulating VEGF/ERK signaling with such dynamism is also crucial for vein specification in vivo ( Chetty et al., 2017 14. Casie Chetty, S. ∙ Rost, M.S. ∙ Enriquez, J.R. ...

Functional characterization of human pluripotent stem cell-derived arterial endothelial cells. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of The United States of America 2017 201702295 Crossref Google Scholar ). Taken together, manipulating VEGF/ERK and WNT in a temporally dynamic way, along with inhibiting artery-specifying signals, differentiated hPSCs into vein ECs ( Figures 3 A, S3 A, and S3B).
Through this approach, we could efficiently generate >88% pure NR2F2 + CD144 + vein ECs, as shown using newly engineered NR2F2-2A-GFP knockin reporter hPSCs ( Martin et al., 2019 71. Martin, R.M. ∙ Ikeda, K. ∙ Cromer, M.K. ...

ECs were vein specific: they minimally expressed arterial markers ( Figure 3 F), consistent with our inhibition of artery-specifying signals (e.g., NOTCH, TGF-β and VEGF/ERK). There was a small fraction (10.7%) of contaminating, mesenchyme-like non-ECs ( Figure 3 F). Taken together, we efficiently generated hPSC-derived vein ECs, with a minority of mesenchyme-like cells. hPSC-derived vein ECs showed high overall transcriptional similarity with in vivo vein ECs within the 4-week-old CS13 human fetus ( Zeng et al., 2019 125. Zeng, Y. ∙ He, J. ∙ Bai, Z. ... Tracing the first hematopoietic stem cell generation in human embryo by single-cell RNA sequencing Cell Res. 2019; 29 :881-894 Crossref Scopus (77) PubMed Google Scholar ) (R = 0.83); both expressed venous markers ( Figures 3 G and S3 F). Genes that were differentially expressed by vein ECs in vivo and in vitro largely related to metabolism and protein translation and trafficking ( Figures S3 G and S3H; Table S2 ). Taken together, hPSC-derived vein ECs are transcriptionally similar to fetal vein ECs, although they are not identical.
In summary, we generate enriched populations of either artery ( Figure 2 ) or vein ECs ( Figure 3 ) within 3 or 4 days of hPSC differentiation, respectively. We find that artery ECs arise earlier than vein ECs from hPSCs, mirroring how artery ECs (∼E8.25) precede vein ECs (∼E9.0) in mouse embryos ( Chong et al., 2011 18. Chong, D.C. ∙ Koo, Y. ∙ Xu, K. ... Stepwise arteriovenous fate acquisition during mammalian vasculogenesis Dev. Dyn. 2011; 240 :2153-2165 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ).
There were stark transcriptome-wide differences between hPSC-derived artery and vein ECs, including disparate expression of known arteriovenous subtype markers ( Figures 4 A and S4 A; Table S3 ). Certain EC attraction and repulsion signals showed arterial- or venous-biased expression, suggesting potential bidirectional signaling between these two EC subtypes to coordinate their spatial positions. First, hPSC-derived artery ECs expressed the chemokine APELIN, whereas vein ECs expressed its cognate receptor ( APLNR ; Figures 4 A and S4 A), which is investigated below. In vivo , artery-secreted APELIN chemoattracts APLNR + veins, thus positioning arteries and veins in parallel ( Kidoya et al., 2015 51. Kidoya, H. ∙ Naito, H. ∙ Muramatsu, F. ... APJ regulates parallel alignment of arteries and veins in the skin Dev. Cell. 2015; 33 :247-259 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ). Second, hPSC-derived vein ECs expressed FLRT2 , a repulsive ligand for the arterially expressed netrin receptor UNC5B ( Figures 4 A and S4 A; Lu et al., 2004 69. Lu, X. ∙ le Noble, F. ∙ Yuan, L. ... The netrin receptor UNC5B mediates guidance events controlling morphogenesis of the vascular system Nature. 2004; 432 :179-186 Crossref Scopus (426) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tai-Nagara et al., 2017 112. Tai-Nagara, I. ∙ Yoshikawa, Y. ∙ Numata, N. ... Placental labyrinth formation in mice requires endothelial FLRT2/UNC5B signaling Development. 2017; 144 :2392-2401 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ), potentially contributing to why arteries and veins do not intermix. However, hPSC-derived artery and vein ECs did not express markers of organ-specific ECs ( Kalucka et al., 2020 50. Kalucka, J. ∙ de Rooij, L.P.M.H. ∙ Goveia, J. ... Single-cell transcriptome atlas of murine endothelial cells Cell. 2020; 180 :764-779.e20 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (317) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure S4 B): hence, they may correspond to the earliest ECs arising during development prior to their entry into various organs ( Chong et al., 2011 18. Chong, D.C. ∙ Koo, Y. ∙ Xu, K. ... Stepwise arteriovenous fate acquisition during mammalian vasculogenesis Dev. Dyn. 2011; 240 :2153-2165 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ). An interactive browser to explore scRNA-seq profiles of hPSC-derived artery and vein ECs is available at https://anglab.shinyapps.io/arteryveinscrna/ .
Importantly, both hPSC-derived artery and vein ECs executed hallmark EC functions. First, both EC subtypes formed three-dimensional vascular networks in vitro when cocultured with mesenchymal cells within fibrin hydrogels for 1 week ( Figures 4 B, S4 C, and S4D; Kurokawa et al., 2017 56. Kurokawa, Y.K. ∙ Yin, R.T. ∙ Shang, M.R. ... Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived endothelial cells for three-dimensional microphysiological systems Tissue Eng. Part C Methods. 2017; 23 :474-484 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Second, artery and vein ECs likewise formed vascular networks in vivo upon subcutaneous transplantation into adult nonobese diabetic-severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD-SCID) Il2rg −/− mice for 1 month ( Figures 4 C–4E). Third, artery and vein ECs also incorporated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and acetylated LDL ( Figures 4 F and S4 E) and sealed a deliberate gap in monolayer cultures ( Figure S4 F).
Nevertheless hPSC-derived artery and vein ECs functionally differed in various properties: (1) responses to shear stress, (2) sprouting ability, (3) responses to inflammation, and (4) migration toward chemokines, revealing differences between these two EC subtypes. First, upon 24 h of exposure to fluid flow, both artery and vein ECs aligned themselves to the flow axis and upregulated flow-induced TF KLF2 ( Figures 4 G and S4 G). However, shear stress preferentially upregulated AQP1 and CX37 in artery ECs ( Figures 4 G and S4 G), evincing different transcriptional responses to shear stress by these two EC subtypes. Second, vein (not artery) ECs coated on beads formed vascular sprouts that protruded into fibrin gels within 24 h ( Figure 4 H). This is consistent with the notion that vein ECs preferentially sprout in vivo ( Red-Horse and Siekmann, 2019 97. Red-Horse, K. ∙ Siekmann, A.F. Veins and arteries Build Hierarchical Branching Patterns Differently: Bottom-Up versus Top-Down BioEssays. 2019; 41 :e1800198 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ; Xu et al., 2014 123. Xu, C. ∙ Hasan, S.S. ∙ Schmidt, I. ... Arteries are formed by vein-derived endothelial tip cells Nat. Commun. 2014; 5 :5758 Crossref Scopus (113) PubMed Google Scholar ). Third, ECs respond to inflammation by upregulating adhesion molecules to recruit immune cells (e.g., Halaidych et al., 2018 44. Halaidych, O.V. ∙ Freund, C. ∙ van den Hil, F. ... Inflammatory responses and barrier function of endothelial cells derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells Stem Cell Rep. 2018; 10 :1642-1656 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ; Patsch et al., 2015 92. Patsch, C. ∙ Challet-Meylan, L. ∙ Thoma, E.C. ... Generation of vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells from human pluripotent stem cells Nat. Cell Biol. 2015; 17 :994-1003 Crossref Scopus (306) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhang et al., 2017 126. Zhang, J. ∙ Chu, L.-F. ∙ Hou, Z. ... Functional characterization of human pluripotent stem cell-derived arterial endothelial cells. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of The United States of America 2017 201702295 Crossref Google Scholar ). Upon treatment with inflammatory cytokine TNF-α for 4 h, both artery and vein ECs upregulated the immune-cell adhesion molecule ICAM1 and physically adhered to monocyte-like cells ( Figures 4 I and 4J). Nevertheless, artery and vein ECs partially differed in their responses to inflammation: immune-cell adhesion molecules VCAM1 and E-SELECTIN were specifically upregulated in artery ECs ( Figures 4 I and S4 H). Fourth, we found that artery and vein ECs migrated toward different chemokines. Vein ECs preferentially migrated across a porous membrane toward the endothelial chemokine APELIN ( Figure 4 K). This is consistent with how vein ECs express higher levels of APLNR ( Figures 4 A and S4 A), which is critical for vein migration in vivo ( Kidoya et al., 2015 51. Kidoya, H. ∙ Naito, H. ∙ Muramatsu, F. ... APJ regulates parallel alignment of arteries and veins in the skin Dev. Cell. 2015; 33 :247-259 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ). Collectively, hPSC-derived artery and vein ECs exhibited important transcriptional and functional differences, reifying that they have acquired distinct subtype identities.
Next, we applied hPSC-derived artery and vein ECs to study the tropism of Nipah and Hendra viruses, which must be handled under BSL4 containment ( CDC and NIH, 2020 15. CDC, NIH Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories United States Department of Health and Human Services, 2020 Google Scholar ). Thus hPSC-derived artery and vein ECs were cryopreserved and then thawed and briefly cultured and expanded prior to viral infection under BSL4 containment. To expand vein ECs, it was critical to continuously inhibit the artery-specifying signals TGF-β and NOTCH ( Figures S5 A and S5B). In these conditions, artery and vein ECs could be cultured for at least 6 days, while retaining their respective subtype identities and the ability to activate interferon signaling ( Figures S5 A–S5D).
Upon infecting artery ECs, Nipah and Hendra viruses induced them to fuse into multinucleated syncytia, including prodigious syncytia harboring up to 23 nuclei per cell ( Figure 5 A). Within 24 h, Nipah virus extensively induced arterial syncytia (accounting for 44.5% of ECs), whereas vein ECs were minimally fused (1.3% of ECs; p = 0.0013, Figure 5 B). Likewise, Hendra virus preferentially induced syncytia among artery ECs (p = 0.0041, Figure 5 B). Nipah virus reduced artery EC numbers by 71.0% within 24 h of infection; vein ECs were significantly less affected (p = 0.0002, Figure S5 E).
By implementing live imaging in BSL4 containment, we confirmed that Nipah and Hendra viruses preferentially induced syncytia formation in artery ECs. Cocultures of GFP + and wild-type hPSC-derived ECs were infected, and cell fusion was continuously quantified by live imaging ( Figures S5 F and S5G; Video S1 ). Nipah-infected artery ECs were progressively consumed into several massive syncytia over tens of hours and eventually eliminated ( Figure 5 C). Again, Nipah and Hendra viruses preferentially induced cell fusion in artery ECs, as opposed to vein ECs ( Figure 5 D). Cell fusion was rapid, occurring in minutes ( Figure 5 E). Strikingly, after virally induced cell fusion, nuclei subsequently aggregated together within syncytia, forming large clusters of nuclei ( Figure 5 E; Video S1 ) akin to a “bunch of grapes” ( Figure 5 A). This contrasts with healthy syncytia (e.g., skeletal muscle), wherein nuclei are randomly distributed across the cell ( Metzger et al., 2012 76. Metzger, T. ∙ Gache, V. ∙ Xu, M. ... MAP and kinesin-dependent nuclear positioning is required for skeletal muscle function Nature. 2012; 484 :120-124 Crossref Scopus (171) PubMed Google Scholar ). Taken together, Nipah and Hendra viruses preferentially induce artery ECs to fuse together, as opposed to vein ECs.

Live-imaging of cocultured wild-type and GFP + artery or vein ECs infected by Nipah or Hendra viruses, related to Figure 5
Consistent with how Nipah virus preferentially induced syncytia among artery ECs, Nipah-infected artery ECs produced 11.2-fold higher levels of Nipah viral RNA relative to vein ECs, as assayed by viral RNA levels in the culture media (p = 0.01, Figure 6 A). Likewise, artery ECs produced 17.4-fold higher levels of Hendra viral RNA compared with vein ECs, (p = 0.01, Figure 6 A). Intracellular viral RNA levels similarly disclosed an arterial tropism of these viruses, with the proviso that at later time points, Nipah RNA levels in artery ECs declined due to destruction of the cells ( Figure S6 A).
Why do Nipah and Hendra viruses preferentially infect artery ECs, as opposed to vein ECs? EFNB2—a known receptor for these viruses ( Bonaparte et al., 2005 10. Bonaparte, M.I. ∙ Dimitrov, A.S. ∙ Bossart, K.N. ... Ephrin-B2 ligand is a functional receptor for Hendra virus and Nipah virus Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102 :10652-10657 Crossref Scopus (310) PubMed Google Scholar ; Negrete et al., 2005 81. Negrete, O.A. ∙ Levroney, E.L. ∙ Aguilar, H.C. ... EphrinB2 is the entry receptor for Nipah virus, an emergent deadly paramyxovirus Nature. 2005; 436 :401-405 Crossref Scopus (347) PubMed Google Scholar )—is expressed more highly by artery ECs in vivo , in both mice ( Chong et al., 2011 18. Chong, D.C. ∙ Koo, Y. ∙ Xu, K. ... Stepwise arteriovenous fate acquisition during mammalian vasculogenesis Dev. Dyn. 2011; 240 :2153-2165 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 1998 117. Wang, H.U. ∙ Chen, Z.F. ∙ Anderson, D.J. Molecular distinction and angiogenic interaction between embryonic arteries and veins revealed by ephrin-B2 and its receptor Eph-B4 Cell. 1998; 93 :741-753 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1355) PubMed Google Scholar ) and humans ( Figure 6 B; Travaglini et al., 2020 115. Travaglini, K.J. ∙ Nabhan, A.N. ∙ Penland, L. ... A molecular cell atlas of the human lung from single-cell RNA sequencing Nature. 2020; 587 :619-625 Crossref Scopus (286) PubMed Google Scholar ). hPSC-derived ECs faithfully reproduced this arteriovenous difference in EFNB2 expression. hPSC-derived artery ECs expressed 8.8- and 10.4-fold higher levels of EFNB2 surface protein and mRNA, respectively, compared with vein ECs ( Figures 6 C, S6 B, and S6C). By contrast, primary human artery and vein ECs expanded in conventional media relinquished arteriovenous differences ( Aranguren et al., 2013 4. Aranguren, X.L. ∙ Agirre, X. ∙ Beerens, M. ... Unraveling a novel transcription factor code determining the human arterial-specific endothelial cell signature Blood. 2013; 122 :3982-3992 Crossref Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar ): they expressed similar EFNB2 levels ( Figure S6 D). In sum, hPSC-derived cell types afford advantages (e.g., preserved subtype identity) relative to previous cellular models used in BSL4 virology.
Preferential Nipah virus entry into artery ECs was principally driven by EFNB2. Genetically deleting EFNB2 using Cas9 ( Figure S6 E; Martin et al., 2019 71. Martin, R.M. ∙ Ikeda, K. ∙ Cromer, M.K. ... Highly efficient and marker-free genome editing of human pluripotent stem cells by CRISPR-Cas9 RNP and AAV6 donor-mediated homologous recombination Cell Stem Cell. 2019; 24 :821-828.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ) led to a substantial 430.3- to 6,289.2-fold reduction of Nipah and Hendra virus replication in EFNB2 −/− artery ECs, respectively ( Figure 6 D). To precisely assay viral entry, we employed Nipah pseudoviruses, which enter cells but do not replicate or inflict virus-specific cellular derangements ( Palomares et al., 2013 90. Palomares, K. ∙ Vigant, F. ∙ Van Handel, B. ... Nipah virus envelope-pseudotyped lentiviruses efficiently target ephrinB2-positive stem cell populations in vitro and bypass the liver sink when administered in vivo J. Virol. 2013; 87 :2094-2108 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, Nipah pseudoviruses entered artery ECs 3.2 ± 0.2 times more efficiently than vein ECs ( Figures 6 E and S6 F). Ablating EFNB2 completely abrogated Nipah pseudovirus entry into artery ECs but did not impair entry of an unrelated vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based pseudovirus ( Figures 6 E and S6 G). Therefore, EFNB2 is necessary for Nipah and Hendra virus entry, complementing the longstanding findings that EFNB2 is sufficient for entry of these viruses ( Bonaparte et al., 2005 10. Bonaparte, M.I. ∙ Dimitrov, A.S. ∙ Bossart, K.N. ... Ephrin-B2 ligand is a functional receptor for Hendra virus and Nipah virus Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102 :10652-10657 Crossref Scopus (310) PubMed Google Scholar ; Negrete et al., 2005 81. Negrete, O.A. ∙ Levroney, E.L. ∙ Aguilar, H.C. ... EphrinB2 is the entry receptor for Nipah virus, an emergent deadly paramyxovirus Nature. 2005; 436 :401-405 Crossref Scopus (347) PubMed Google Scholar ).
In sum, the developmental bifurcation between artery versus vein ECs is important for viral infection, as it culminates in differential expression of viral-entry receptors (i.e., EFNB2) between these two EC subtypes and thus differing susceptibility to Nipah and Hendra infection. Beyond EFNB2, artery and vein ECs also differ in the expression of other genes, which may contribute to preferential viral entry and replication efficiencies in artery ECs.
Finally, we used RNA-seq to discover how artery ECs transcriptionally react to Nipah virus, Hendra virus, or a related non-pathogenic paramyxovirus, Sendai virus (Cantell strain) ( López et al., 2006 67. López, C.B. ∙ Yount, J.S. ∙ Hermesh, T. ... Sendai virus infection induces efficient adaptive immunity independently of type I interferons J. Virol. 2006; 80 :4538-4545 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cells were infected with a high viral titer (multiplicity of infection [MOI] ≈ 5), and RNA-seq was performed at 5, 10, or 15 h post-infection ( Figure 7 A; Table S4 ). All three paramyxoviruses exhibited the expected 3′-to-5′ gene transcriptional gradient along their genomes ( Figures S7 A and S7B), authenticating our RNA-seq analysis.
Between 5 and 15 h post-infection, Nipah and Hendra virus RNA replicated extensively in artery ECs (114.5- and 93.2-fold increase, respectively), relative to Sendai virus, which achieved limited (2.9-fold) RNA replication ( Figure 7 A). After 15 h, Nipah occupied 17.2% of the transcriptome (∼1 in 6 mRNAs encoding Nipah genes) and Hendra occupied 6.4% of the transcriptome ( Figure 7 A). Therefore, Nipah and Hendra viruses replicate significantly more efficiently than the non-pathogenic Sendai virus in artery ECs.
Despite immense viral replication and cell fusion, Nipah and Hendra viruses led to surprisingly minimal host gene expression changes: they were remarkably effective at suppressing interferon production. Nipah virus massively replicated in artery ECs, yet it did not upregulate or downregulate a single gene across the entire transcriptome to a statistically significant extent, at 5–10 h post-infection ( Figures 7 B and S7 C). Similar results were observed for Hendra virus ( Figures 7 B and S7 C). Even when Nipah and Hendra virus RNA achieved extremely high levels at later time points (6.4%–17.2% of the transcriptome, at 15 h post-infection), artery ECs minimally upregulated IFNβ1 , IFNλ1 , and interferon target genes IFIT2 and IFIT3 (all less than 6-fold upregulation; Figures 7 C and 7D). Despite high viral loads, Nipah- or Hendra-infected artery ECs did not secrete the antiviral cytokine IFNβ to a statistically significant degree at 12 or 24 h post-infection ( Figure 7 E). This starkly differed from Sendai virus, which induced a 100.8-fold elevation in IFNβ secretion within 24 h ( Figure 7 E). Despite low viral loads (<0.8% of the transcriptome), Sendai potently induced antiviral genes, including type I/III interferons ( López et al., 2006 67. López, C.B. ∙ Yount, J.S. ∙ Hermesh, T. ... Sendai virus infection induces efficient adaptive immunity independently of type I interferons J. Virol. 2006; 80 :4538-4545 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ) and interferon response genes that restrict viral replication ( Shaw et al., 2017 107. Shaw, A.E. ∙ Hughes, J. ∙ Gu, Q. ... Fundamental properties of the mammalian innate immune system revealed by multispecies comparison of type I interferon responses PLoS Biol. 2017; 15 :e2004086 Crossref Scopus (137) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figures 7 C and 7D). Additionally, Sendai-infected artery ECs elaborated immune cytokines, chemokines, and immune-cell adhesion molecules known to recruit immune cells; these antiviral and inflammatory genes were minimally induced by Nipah or Hendra infection ( Figures 7 C and 7D). Normalizing to viral loads, Nipah and Hendra viruses induced IFNλ1 to a much lower extent (69.5- and 45.1-fold, respectively) than Sendai virus ( Figure 7 D). Likewise, Nipah and Hendra viruses upregulated interferon target gene IFIT2 much less effectively (109.2- and 23.2-fold, respectively) than Sendai virus ( Figure 7 D).

Section: Discussion

To precisely induce desired cellular subtypes, here, we chart a stepwise road map for hPSC differentiation into artery versus vein subtypes of ECs. We mapped the temporally dynamic extracellular signals that drive or inhibit each step of differentiation. At the bifurcation between artery versus vein subtypes, we precisely induced artery ECs by repressing vein-specifying signals and vice versa. This approach generated >90% pure populations of artery- versus vein-specific ECs within 3–4 days of hPSC differentiation. The ability to efficiently and rapidly generate artery and vein ECs “on demand” should avail regenerative medicine, tissue engineering, and modeling of human vascular diseases. Importantly, these hPSC-derived artery and vein ECs were distinguished by clear transcriptional and functional differences. Here, we emphasize a pivotal distinction between artery and vein ECs: Nipah and Hendra viruses preferentially target artery ECs in vitro . In turn, this subtype-specific viral tropism emphasizes the importance of producing specific cellular subtypes in vitro and provides a vista on the target cells of deadly viruses.
First, we differentiated hPSCs into MIXL1 + primitive streak and then SCL + HAND1 + lateral mesoderm within 1 and 2 days, respectively. Subsequently, hPSC-derived lateral mesoderm bifurcated into >90% pure SOX17 + artery ECs (day 3) or, alternatively, >90% pure NR2F2 + vein ECs (day 4). Thus, artery ECs arise prior to vein ECs in vitro , consistent with in vivo findings ( Chong et al., 2011 18. Chong, D.C. ∙ Koo, Y. ∙ Xu, K. ... Stepwise arteriovenous fate acquisition during mammalian vasculogenesis Dev. Dyn. 2011; 240 :2153-2165 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar )—these two cellular subtypes do not arise synchronously.
As opposed to generating “generic” cell types of ambiguous subtype identity, we hypothesized it should be possible to produce desired cellular subtypes by explicitly inhibiting the signals that induce the opposing cellular subtype. At the bifurcation between artery and vein subtypes, TGF-β and NOTCH specify artery fate, whereas PI3K instructs vein identity. We induced artery ECs through a two-pronged approach: activating artery-inducing signal TGF-β, while repressing vein-specifying signal PI3K. The converse signals—TGF-β and NOTCH inhibition (together with PI3K activation)—instead induced vein ECs. This signaling logic enabled the exclusive generation of either artery or vein ECs in the absence of the opposing lineage, as quantified by scRNA-seq and other means. Our findings thus reveal a more complex signaling code for artery versus vein specification, extending beyond the current manipulation of VEGF and/or NOTCH (reviewed by Coultas et al., 2005 23.

Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of The United States of America 2017 201702295 Crossref Google Scholar ). Explicitly “inhibiting” the signals that specify alternate subtype identities may be a general approach to precisely engineer desired cellular subtypes from stem cells.
hPSCs swiftly traverse alternating lineage paths every 24 h, and consequently, extracellular signals must be rapidly activated or inhibited to precisely guide differentiation down desired paths in preference to unwanted ones. Indeed, in the mouse embryo, cells rapidly segue between different states every 12–24 h: E5.5 pluripotent cells → E6.5 primitive streak → ∼E7–E7.5 lateral mesoderm → ∼E8.25 artery ECs, and ∼E9.0 vein ECs ( Chong et al., 2011 18. Chong, D.C. ∙ Koo, Y. ∙ Xu, K. ... Stepwise arteriovenous fate acquisition during mammalian vasculogenesis Dev. Dyn. 2011; 240 :2153-2165 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found the same extracellular signal specified 3 different cell types over the course of 3 days. For instance, TGF-β initially induced mid primitive streak on day 1, then repressed lateral mesoderm on day 2, and finally induced arterial ECs on day 3. By contrast, VEGF induced lateral mesoderm on day 2 and then induced and eventually inhibited vein ECs on days 3 and 4, respectively. Temporally dynamic activation and repression of extracellular signals was required to efficiently transition cells from one state to the next, with two consecutive cell types sometimes sharing diametrically opposed requirements for the same signal (e.g., VEGF) in vitro , consistent with VEGF’s temporally dynamic role in vivo ( Chetty et al., 2017 14.

Failure of blood-island formation and vasculogenesis in Flk-1-deficient mice Nature. 1995; 376 :62-66 Crossref Scopus (3332) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consequently, prolonged activation or inhibition of a given signal generates a heterogeneous cell population. The previously overlooked requirement for temporally dynamic TGF-β and VEGF signals likely complicated past efforts to generate artery and vein ECs from hPSCs. It is therefore critical to map the temporal dynamics with which these signals operate, and to manipulate them with equal dynamism to precisely effect differentiation.
By virtue of their high fatality rates and a general dearth of approved treatments, risk-group-4 viruses imperil global health: mapping their human target cells and their effects on such cells is crucial. Arteries and veins have largely been regarded synonymously in viral diseases. However, we found Nipah and Hendra viruses preferentially targeted artery ECs and fused them into multinucleated arterial ECs in vitro . This is consonant with a past study of Syrian hamsters, which suggested that Nipah primarily infected arteries in vivo , as morphologically inferred by elastic membrane staining ( Baseler et al., 2015 8. Baseler, L. ∙ de Wit, E. ∙ Scott, D.P. ... Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) oronasally inoculated with a Nipah virus isolate from Bangladesh or Malaysia develop similar respiratory tract lesions Vet. Pathol. 2015; 52 :38-45 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ). Hence, as opposed to promiscuously targeting all ECs, we demonstrate that certain viruses may preferentially target specific endothelial subtypes. Mechanistically, this arterial tropism was driven at least in part by higher expression of viral-entry receptor EFNB2 ( Bonaparte et al., 2005 10. Bonaparte, M.I. ∙ Dimitrov, A.S. ∙ Bossart, K.N. ... Ephrin-B2 ligand is a functional receptor for Hendra virus and Nipah virus Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102 :10652-10657 Crossref Scopus (310) PubMed Google Scholar ; Negrete et al., 2005 81. Negrete, O.A. ∙ Levroney, E.L. ∙ Aguilar, H.C. ... EphrinB2 is the entry receptor for Nipah virus, an emergent deadly paramyxovirus Nature. 2005; 436 :401-405 Crossref Scopus (347) PubMed Google Scholar ) in artery ECs, which we demonstrated was required for viral entry, as shown by genetic deletion. The developmental diversification of artery versus vein ECs may thus hold hitherto-unappreciated significance in viral diseases.

Differential innate immune responses elicited by Nipah virus and cedar virus correlate with disparate in vivo pathogenesis in hamsters Viruses. 2019; 11 291–211 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, these ECs were cultured in conditions wherein arteriovenous subtype identity was lost ( Aranguren et al., 2013 4. Aranguren, X.L. ∙ Agirre, X. ∙ Beerens, M. ... Unraveling a novel transcription factor code determining the human arterial-specific endothelial cell signature Blood. 2013; 122 :3982-3992 Crossref Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar ), often unbeknownst to researchers. This thus accentuates the importance of being able to generate and maintain well-defined populations of hPSC-derived artery and vein ECs in vitro to study whether viruses preferentially target specific EC subtypes and exert subtype-specific effects.
Having identified artery ECs as preferential target cells of Nipah and Hendra viruses, we systematically detailed the effects of these viruses on artery ECs using live imaging and RNA-seq. One of the greatest surprises was that Nipah and Hendra viruses inflicted surprisingly minor transcriptional effects on artery ECs, despite extensive viral replication and prodigious cell fusion. Indeed, both viruses were “stealthy” to the innate immune system of artery ECs. Despite occupying an impressive fraction (6.4%–17.2%) of an artery cell’s transcriptome, both Nipah and Hendra viruses minimally induced interferon signaling or antiviral genes. This minimal interferon response correlated with the ability of these lethal viruses to massively replicate and achieve high viral loads, in stark contrast with the non-pathogenic Sendai virus. Indeed, Nipah virus P, V, and W proteins are known to silence interferon production and signaling ( Childs et al., 2007 17. Childs, K. ∙ Stock, N. ∙ Ross, C. ... mda-5, but not RIG-I, is a common target for paramyxovirus V proteins Virology. 2007; 359 :190-200 Crossref Scopus (250) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ciancanelli et al., 2009 20.

Past studies reached diverging conclusions regarding whether Nipah virus activates ( Elvert et al., 2020 33. Elvert, M. ∙ Sauerhering, L. ∙ Maisner, A.

Virol. 2011; 85 :4031-4034 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ), interferon signaling in vitro . Here, we re-investigate this question using well-defined populations of artery and vein ECs. Additionally, we quantify the extent of interferon suppression “relative” to respective viral RNA loads, using RNA-seq. Our work also illuminates the cellular effects of Hendra virus, which hitherto were generally understudied relative to, and assumed to be similar to, Nipah virus.
More broadly, we introduce hPSC-derived cell types as enhanced model systems to study the target cells and cellular effects of risk-group-4 viruses. Due to BSL4 experimental constraints, in vitro studies of risk-group-4 viruses have hitherto exploited cancer cells (which poorly reflect native physiology) or primary cells (which are difficult to expand long term and to genetically edit, and often relinquish features of their in vivo counterparts), neither of which may harbor clear subtype identities (e.g., arteriovenous identity). hPSC-derived cell types can be rapidly generated in large numbers, are genetically manipulatable, and retain certain properties of their in vivo counterparts (e.g., subtype identity) ( Drubin and Hyman, 2017 30. Drubin, D.G. ∙ Hyman, A.A. Stem cells: the new “model organism” Mol. Biol. Cell. 2017; 28 :1409-1411 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ). These decisive advantages of hPSC-derived cell types have already been exploited to provide new insights into risk-group-2 and -3 viruses ( Harschnitz and Studer, 2021 46. Harschnitz, O. ∙ Studer, L. Human stem cell models to study host-virus interactions in the central nervous system Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2021; 21 :441-453 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ; Simoneau and Ott, 2020 109. Simoneau, C.R. ∙ Ott, M. Modeling multi-organ infection by SARS-CoV-2 using stem cell technology Cell Stem Cell. 2020; 27 :859-868 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, hPSC-derived ECs exemplify many of these advantages: they exhibit arteriovenous differences in EFNB2 expression (which are otherwise obscured in primary ECs cultured in conventional conditions) and are genetically tractable (as evinced by our genetic deletion of EFNB2 to confirm its role in viral entry).
Beyond Nipah and Hendra viruses, hPSC-derived artery and vein ECs could provide a powerful platform to delineate the target cells and cellular effects of additional risk-group-4 viruses—including arenaviruses, filoviruses, flaviviruses, and nairoviruses—that cause lethal and enigmatic vascular diseases. Eventually hPSC-derived cell types could enable therapeutic and genetic screens to discover countermeasures against currently incurable risk-group-4 viruses, using cell types that are more physiologically relevant than the cancer cells often used in BSL4 experiments.
The endothelial road map described here remains incomplete: it focuses on artery and vein ECs but does not encompass generation of capillaries, lymphatics, or organ-specific ECs ( Augustin and Koh, 2017 6.

Finally, while we find Nipah and Hendra viruses preferentially target human artery ECs in vitro , in vivo verification is of paramount import. In this regard, it is critical to appreciate that cells in vivo and in vitro are not equivalent ( Fowler et al., 2019 37. Fowler, J.L. ∙ Ang, L.T. ∙ Loh, K.M. A critical look: challenges in differentiating human pluripotent stem cells into desired cell types and organoids Wiley Interdiscip. Rev.: Dev. Biol. 2019; 113 891–823 Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar ): hPSC-derived artery and vein ECs are transcriptionally similar, but are not identical to, their respective in vivo counterparts. Going forward, we envision that hPSC-derived cell types will provide a powerful in vitro platform to explore the tropism and biology of risk-group-4 viruses, generating hypotheses that can then be tested in de rigueur animal models in vivo .

Multiple human pluripotent stem cell lines were developed as part of this study: H1 NR2F2-2A-GFP hESCs, H1 SOX17-2A-mPlum hESCs, H1 EFNB2 -/- hESCs, SUN004.1.9 CAG-eGFP hiPSCs, SUN004.2 CAG-mScarlet hiPSCs, and SUN003.1 CAG-AkaLuciferase-tdTomato hiPSCs. All cell lines will be made freely available upon request and the completion of applicable Material Transfer Agreements.
All cells in this study were cultured in standard incubator conditions (20% O 2 , 5% CO 2 and 37 °C).
The following human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) lines were used in this study: wild-type H1, H7 and H9 hESCs (WiCell); H9 SOX17-mCherry knock-in reporter hESCs ( Loh et al., 2014 65. Loh, K.M. ∙ Ang, L.T. ∙ Zhang, J. ... Efficient endoderm induction from human pluripotent stem cells by logically directing signals controlling lineage bifurcations Cell Stem Cell. 2014; 14 :237-252 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (224) PubMed Google Scholar ); H1 NR2F2-2A-GFP knock-in reporter hESCs (generated in this study); H1 SOX17-2A-mPlum knock-in reporter hESCs (generated in this study); SUN004.1.9 hiPSCs carrying a constitutively-expressed CAG-GFP PiggyBac transgene (generated in this study); SUN004.2 hiPSCs carrying a constitutively-expressed CAG-mScarlet lentiviral transgene (generated in this study); and SUN003.1 hiPSCs carrying a constitutively-expressed CAG-AkaLuciferase-tdTomato lentiviral transgene (generated in this study). SUN004.1.9, SUN004.2 and SUN003.1 hiPSCs represent three clonal hiPSC lines originally obtained from two different individuals (SUN003 and SUN004). H1, SUN004.1.9, SUN004.2 and SUN003.1 hPSCs are of a XY genotype, whereas H7 and H9 hPSCs are of a XX genotype.
Undifferentiated hPSCs were propagated in mTeSR1 medium (StemCell Technologies) + 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Thermo Fisher) or alternatively, mTeSR Plus medium (StemCell Technologies) + 1% penicillin/streptomycin in monolayer cultures, on Geltrex basement membrane matrix-coated plates (described below). For mTeSR1, media was changed daily and for mTeSR Plus, media was changed every other day as per the manufacturer’s recommendations. For the sake of brevity, we refer to mTeSR1 and mTeSR Plus interchangeably as “mTeSR” for the remainder of these Methods. In order to maintain cultures of undifferentiated hPSCs, when they became partially confluent, undifferentiated hPSCs were passaged by treating them for 7 minutes with EDTA (Versene, Thermo Fisher) at room temperature. Subsequently, EDTA was removed, mTeSR was added, and then hPSCs were manually scraped off the plate to generate clumps. hPSC clumps were then seeded onto new plates that had been precoated with Geltrex basement membrane matrix (described below) in mTeSR medium + 1% penicillin/streptomycin. To reiterate, during EDTA-based maintenance passaging of undifferentiated hPSCs as clumps, ROCK inhibitor was not added.
After differentiation of hPSCs into artery cells (within 3 days, as described below) or vein cells (within 4 days, as described below), the resultant hPSC-derived artery and vein cells could be expanded for up to 6 additional days. Day 3 hPSC-derived artery cells were expanded in EGM2 (Endothelial Cell Growth Medium 2, Lonza CC-3162), which was refreshed every 24 hours. Day 4 hPSC-derived vein cells were expanded in EGM2 + SB505124 (2 μM) + RO4929097 (2 μM), which was refreshed every 24 hours. Expansion of hPSC-derived artery and vein cells was performed in monolayer cultures on Geltrex-coated cell culture plates. Expanded hPSC-derived artery and vein cells were used for certain functional assays as well as viral infection experiments. The biological sex of hPSC-derived artery and vein cells corresponds to the biological sex of the parental hPSC line used to generate them.
Human umbilical artery endothelial cells (HUAEC, Sigma-Aldrich, 202-05N) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC, Sigma-Aldrich, 200-05N) were both propagated on Geltrex-coated plates in EGM2 (Lonza CC-3162) media, which was refreshed every 1-2 days. The biological sex of these primary human endothelial cells was not determined.
Primary human adult lung fibroblasts (normal human lung fibroblasts [NHLF], Lonza, CC-2512) were propagated in Fibroblast Growth Medium-2 (Lonza, CC-3132), with media changes every 2-3 days. Once confluent, fibroblasts were washed twice with DPBS without ions (Thermo Fisher, 14190144) and exposed to 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA (Thermo Fisher, 25300062) for 2 min. Trypsin was neutralized using fresh FGM2, and the cell solution was centrifuged at 300g in order to pellet cells for additional culture or experiments. Human fibroblasts were cocultured with endothelial cells to generate 3-dimensional vascular networks (described below). For all relevant experiments, fibroblasts between passages 3-7 were used. Where indicated, NHLFs obtained from different donors were used in experiments. The biological sex of these primary human lung fibroblasts was not determined.
THP1 cells (ATCC, TIB-202) were propagated in RPMI-1640 + 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in suspension cultures, and were passaged every 2-3 days by adding fresh media and diluting their concentration to 3x10 5 cells/mL. THP1 cells were used to assess the ability of immune cells to adhere to endothelial cells (described below). THP1 cells represent a transformed human monocyte-like cell line of a XY genotype.
HEK293T/17 cells (ATCC, CRL-11268) were propagated in DMEM + 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and were passaged every 3-4 days at a 1:10 ratio through trypsinization. HEK293T/17 cells were used to package pseudotyped lentivirus particles (described below). HEK293T/17 cells represent a transformed human cell line that is an easily-transfected derivative of the parental HEK293T line, and are of a XX genotype.
Vero C1008 (Vero 76, clone E6, Vero E6) cells (European Collection of Authenticated Cell Cultures (ECACC), 85020206) were propagated in DMEM containing 2% FBS, 2 mM glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin and passaged at a 1:10 ratio through trypsinization. Vero E6 cells were used to propagate Nipah and Hendra viruses in order to generate viral stocks and to quantitatively titrate infectious virus from the supernatant of virally-infected cell cultures (described below). Vero E6 cells represent a transformed African green monkey ( Chlorocebus sabaeus ) cell line of a XX genotype.
Immunodeficient NOD-SCID Il2rg -/- (NSG) mice, obtained from The Jackson Laboratory, were housed in the Lokey Stem Cell Research Building’s Barrier Mouse Facility. Adult NSG mice were transplanted with hPSC-derived artery and vein ECs (described below). At the time of transplantation, NSG mice were 2-4 months old and both male and female mice were used.
Nipah virus, Malaysia variant (Nipah virus/human/MY/1999/CDC; genomic sequence reported in NCBI accession number GenBank: NC_002728) was originally isolated by the CDC from the cerebrum of an infected human in Malaysia in 1999, and was passaged on Vero E6 cells ( Harcourt et al., 2000 45.

The original provenance of Sendai virus, Cantell strain is unknown, but it was passaged over 100 times in chicken embryonated eggs at the Central Public Health Laboratory in Helsinki, Finland ( Cantell and Hirvonen, 1981 12. Cantell, K. ∙ Hirvonen, S. Preparation and assay of Sendai virus Methods Enzymol. 1981; 78 :299-301 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Sendai virus, Cantell strain is known to induce interferon-β signaling in vivo and in vitro : it does not cause severe disease in mice, nor is it presently known to cause human disease ( López et al., 2006 67.

Other types of data visualization were prepared as described in the respective sections below.
hPSCs were maintained and differentiated on cell culture plates that been pre-coated with either Geltrex or vitronectin basement membrane matrices. Geltrex (Thermo Fisher) was diluted 1:100-1:200 in DMEM/F12 (Thermo Fisher) and was used to coat tissue culture plastics for at least 1 hour at 37 °C. Recombinant human truncated vitronectin (Gibco, A14700; “VTN-N”) was diluted to a 10 μg/mL stock in PBS (lacking Ca 2+ or Mg 2+ ) and was used to coat tissue culture plastics for at least 1 hour at 37 °C. After coating with either Geltrex or vitronectin, the basement membrane solution was aspirated, leaving behind a thin film; subsequently, cells were plated on the Geltrex- or vitronectin-coated cell culture plastics.
hPSCs were differentiated into artery and vein cells as described below in Chemically Defined Medium 2 (CDM2). The composition of CDM2 has been described previously ( Loh et al., 2014 65.

Polyvinyl alcohol was brought into suspension by gentle warming and magnetic stirring, and the media was sterilely filtered (through a 0.22 μm filter) prior to use.
• Seeding hPSCs for differentiation ( Step 0 ). In contrast to passaging hPSCs for maintenance, a different passaging procedure was used to plate hPSCs for differentiation; notably, sparse seeding of hPSCs as single cells is paramount for efficient differentiation. To seed hPSCs for differentiation, undifferentiated hPSCs were dissociated into single cells (Accutase, Thermo Fisher) and plated into recipient wells in mTeSR supplemented with thiazovivin (1 μM, Tocris; a ROCK inhibitor, to enhance hPSC survival after passaging) onto plates precoated with either Geltrex basement membrane matrix or recombinant Vitronectin (described above), thus plating 25,000-50,000 hPSCs/cm 2 (i.e., ∼95,000-190,000 hPSCs/well of a 12-well plate). Freshly-seeded hPSCs were allowed to adhere and recover for 24 hours in mTeSR + 1 μM thiazovivin prior to initiating differentiation, during which the hPSCs re-formed small clumps. All subsequent differentiation steps were performed in defined, serum-free CDM2 basal media ( Loh et al., 2014 65. Loh, K.M. ∙ Ang, L.T. ∙ Zhang, J. ... Efficient endoderm induction from human pluripotent stem cells by logically directing signals controlling lineage bifurcations Cell Stem Cell. 2014; 14 :237-252 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (224) PubMed Google Scholar , 2016 66.

Mapping the pairwise choices leading from pluripotency to human bone, heart, and other mesoderm cell types Cell. 2016; 166 :451-467 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (215) PubMed Google Scholar ). To reiterate, hPSCs are maintained by passaging as clumps (to maintain normal karyotype) but are seeded for differentiation as single cells (to enable efficient differentiation). • Day 1 ( mid primitive streak induction, 24 hours [ Step 1 ]). Day 0 hPSCs were briefly washed (DMEM/F12, Thermo Fisher) to remove all traces of mTeSR + thiazovivin. Then, they were differentiated towards mid primitive streak in CDM2 media supplemented with Activin A (30 ng/mL, R&D Systems), BMP4 (40 ng/mL, R&D Systems), CHIR99021 (6 μM, Tocris), FGF2 (20 ng/mL, Thermo Fisher) for 24 hours, as previously described ( Loh et al., 2016 66. Loh, K.M. ∙ Chen, A. ∙ Koh, P.W. ... Mapping the pairwise choices leading from pluripotency to human bone, heart, and other mesoderm cell types Cell. 2016; 166 :451-467 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (215) PubMed Google Scholar ) (with the optional addition of PIK90 (100 nM, Calbiochem)). • Day 2 ( lateral mesoderm induction, 24 hours [ Step 2 ]). Day 1 mid primitive streak cells were briefly washed (DMEM/F12) and then differentiated towards lateral mesoderm in CDM2 media supplemented with BMP4 (40 ng/mL), GDC-0941 (2.5 μM, Cellagen Technology), Forskolin (10 μM, Tocris), SB-505124 (2 μM, Tocris), VEGF (100 ng/mL, R&D Systems), XAV939 (1 μM, Tocris) and ascorbic acid-2-phosphate (AA2P; 200 μg/mL, Sigma) for 24 hours. Subsequently, lateral mesoderm was used for artery induction ( Step 3a ; below) or vein induction ( Step 3b ; below). • Day 3 ( artery induction, 24 hours [ Step 3a ]). Day 2 lateral mesoderm cells were briefly washed (DMEM/F12) and then differentiated towards artery ECs in CDM2 media supplemented with Activin A (15 ng/mL), DMH1 (250 nM, Tocris), GDC-0941 (2.5 μM), VEGF (100 ng/mL), XAV939 (1 μM) and AA2P (200 μg/mL) for 24 hours, thereby yielding day 3 artery ECs. • Days 3-4 ( vein induction, 24 hours [ Step 3b ]). Day 2 lateral mesoderm cells were briefly washed (DMEM/F12) and then differentiated in CDM2 media supplemented with SB505124 (2 μM), DMH1 (250 nM), RO4929097 (2 μM, Cellagen Technology), VEGF (100 ng/mL), XAV939 (1 μM) and AA2P (200 μg/mL) for 24 hours. Subsequently, day 3 cells were briefly washed (DMEM/F12) and then differentiated in CDM2 media supplemented with SB505124 (2 μM), RO4929097 (2 μM), PD0325901 (500 nM, Tocris), CHIR99021 (1 μM) and AA2P (200 μg/mL) for 24 hours, thereby yielding day 4 vein ECs.
In most experiments, hPSCs were plated and then differentiated into artery and vein ECs using the aforementioned media with respective media changes every 24 hours (without dissociating and re-plating cells at intermediate timepoints). However, we subsequently found that the efficiency of vein EC differentiation was enhanced when, at the end of day 2 of differentiation, lateral mesoderm cells were dissociated and re-plated at high density (∼79,000 cells/cm 2 , i.e., 300,000-400,000 cells/well of a 12-well plate) in day-3 vein induction media ( Figure S3 B). No ROCK inhibitor was used when re-plating lateral mesoderm cells. After 24 hours, day-3 cells were then differentiated into vein ECs using the aforementioned day-4 vein induction media without any additional resplitting.
After hPSC differentiation into artery cells (within 3 days) or vein cells (within 4 days) as described above, they could be maintained for at least 6 additional days in vitro on Geltrex-coated cell culture plates. Day 3 hPSC-derived artery cells were expanded in EGM2 (Endothelial Cell Growth Medium 2, Lonza CC-3162), which was refreshed every 24 hours. Day 4 hPSC-derived vein cells were expanded in EGM2 + SB505124 (2 μM) + RO4929097 (2 μM), which was refreshed every 24 hours.
After hPSC differentiation into artery cells (within 3 days) or vein cells (within 4 days) as described above, they were dissociated using either Accutase (Thermo Fisher) or TrypLE Express (Thermo Fisher). hPSC-derived artery cells were of sufficient purity to be frozen directly, whereas in certain experiments, hPSC-derived vein cells were first magnetically enriched for CD34 + cells using CD34 microbead-based Magnetically Activated Cell Sorting (MACS, Miltenyi Biotec 130-046-703) prior to freezing. MACS was performed generally as per the manufacturer’s recommendations, with slight modifications: after dissociation, hPSC-derived vein cells were counted using a hemocytometer, and then resuspended in FACS buffer (PBS + BSA + EDTA) with a 6- to 7-fold excess of CD34 microbeads and Fc blocking reagent (Miltenyi Biotec 130-046-703) compared to the manufacturer’s recommendation. Vein cells were stained on ice for 30 minutes with CD34 microbeads and Fc blocking reagent, washed, and then magnetically bound to a MACS LS column (Miltenyi Biotech 130-042-401). Unbound cells were then magnetically bound to a second MACS LS column to recover any residual CD34 + cells that were not captured in the first enrichment. Subsequently, CD34 + vein cells were collected, pelleted, and frozen. Flow cytometry was performed prior to and after magnetic enrichment (both bound and unbound cell fractions) to assess the precision of cell enrichment, which yielded >95% pure CD144 + cells throughout all MACS experiments. Both hPSC-derived artery and vein cells were frozen in freezing media (90% FBS + 10% DMSO, which was sterilely filtered before use) in cryopreservation vials, and were transferred to liquid N 2 for long-term storage.
When desired, hPSC-derived artery and vein cells were rapidly thawed in a 37 °C water bath, washed to remove freezing media, and then thawed onto Geltrex-coated plates. As described above, hPSC-derived artery cells were maintained in EGM2, whereas hPSC-derived vein cells were maintained in EGM2 + SB505124 (2 μM) + RO4929097 (2 μM). For the first 24 hours post-thawing, ROCK inhibitor (thiazovivin, 1 μM) was added to both artery and vein cells to enhance cell survival, and was subsequently removed.

Freshly-seeded hPSCs were allowed to adhere and recover for 24 hours in mTeSR + 1 μM thiazovivin prior to initiating differentiation.

Flow cytometry to quantify the efficiency of EC differentiation was performed on days 0, 3, 5 and 6 of differentiation.
Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from two different healthy adult human volunteers (SUN003 and SUN004) were reprogrammed using non-integrating, replication-deficient Sendai viruses encoding the iPSC reprogramming factors ( Nishimura et al., 2017 85. Nishimura, K. ∙ Ohtaka, M. ∙ Takada, H. ... Simple and effective generation of transgene-free induced pluripotent stem cells using an auto-erasable Sendai virus vector responding to microRNA-302 Stem Cell Res. 2017; 23 :13-19 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ). This yielded SUN004.1.9 hiPSCs (referring to donor 4, line 1, subclone 9), SUN004.2 hiPSCs (referring to donor 4, line 2) and SUN003.1 hiPSCs (referring to donor 3, line 1) used in this study.
Ficoll was used to isolate PBMCs from the whole blood of healthy human adult volunteers (SUN003 and SUN004), whose identities were kept anonymous. 2 million PBMCs from each donor were split between two wells of a 24-well plate, with each well containing 1 million cells in 1 mL of PBMC media (RPMI + 10% FBS + GM-CSF (10 ng/mL) + IL-3 (10 ng/mL) + IL-6 (10 ng/mL) + FLT3L (10 ng/mL) + TPO (10 ng/mL) + SCF (10 ng/mL)) for PBMC expansion; cultures were kept in standard incubator conditions (37 °C and 5% CO 2 ). After 6 days of PBMC expansion, cells were dissociated and combined into a single well of a 24-well plate in fresh PBMC media and expansion cytokines.
Subsequently, PBMCs were inoculated with replication-deficient, auto-erasing Sendai virus encoding KLF4 , OCT4 ( POU5F1 ), SOX2 and C-MYC (a gift from Dr. Mahito Nakanishi, at the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, Japan ( Nishimura et al., 2017 85.

This recombinant Sendai virus has been described previously: it encodes 1 ) modified versions of the NP and P / C/V/W genes of Sendai virus (Nagoya strain), followed by 2 ) KLF4 , OCT4 , SOX2 and C-MYC genes, and finally 3 ) a modified version of the L gene of Sendai virus (C1.151 strain) whose 3’ UTR contains 4x repeats of the miR-302 target sequence ( Nishimura et al., 2011 86. Nishimura, K. ∙ Sano, M. ∙ Ohtaka, M. ... Development of defective and persistent Sendai virus vector: a unique gene delivery/expression system ideal for cell reprogramming J. Biol.

Simple and effective generation of transgene-free induced pluripotent stem cells using an auto-erasable Sendai virus vector responding to microRNA-302 Stem Cell Res. 2017; 23 :13-19 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ). This recombinant Sendai virus does not encode the structural genes M , F or HN and thus is replication-deficient: after infecting a cell, it does not produce progeny virions ( Nishimura et al., 2011 86. Nishimura, K. ∙ Sano, M. ∙ Ohtaka, M. ... Development of defective and persistent Sendai virus vector: a unique gene delivery/expression system ideal for cell reprogramming J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286 :4760-4771 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (251) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, after infected cells have become reprogrammed into iPSCs and upregulate miR-302 , this recombinant Sendai virus becomes auto-erased, as it contains 4x repeats of the miR-302 target sequence ( Nishimura et al., 2017 85. Nishimura, K. ∙ Ohtaka, M. ∙ Takada, H. ... Simple and effective generation of transgene-free induced pluripotent stem cells using an auto-erasable Sendai virus vector responding to microRNA-302 Stem Cell Res. 2017; 23 :13-19 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ).
2 days after inoculation with Sendai virus, cells were again dissociated, pelleted and resuspended in 12 mL of 50% PBMC media and 50% hiPSC media (DMEM/F12, 20% KnockOut Serum Replacement [KOSR], 1% non-essential amino acids [NEAA], 1% penicillin/streptomycin [P/S], 100 μM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 5 ng/ml FGF2) supplemented with GM-CSF (10 ng/mL), IL-3 (10 ng/mL), IL-6 (10 ng/mL), FLT3L (10 ng/mL), TPO (10 ng/mL) and SCF (10 ng/mL). The cell suspension was split among three wells of a 6-well plate that contained mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). MEFs had been seeded on the previous day by first coating wells with 0.1% porcine gelatin (which had been pre-coated for 1 hour at 37 °C), after which mitomycin-C-treated, mitotically-inactivated C57BL/6 MEFs were plated at 15,000 cells/cm 2 in MEF media (DMEM with 10% FBS). After plating hiPSCs on MEFs in 50% PBMC media + 50% hiPSC media, half-media changes were performed for the next 7-10 days with hiPSC media, thereby gradually shifting the overall media composition towards hiPSC media.
Morphologically-conspicuous hiPSC colonies were then manually picked, mechanically separated by pipette trituration and placed in hiPSC media on a new MEF-coated plate with 10 μM Y-27632 (ROCK inhibitor, to enhance cell survival) for first 24 hours. After 5 days of daily media changes (using hiPSC media), hiPSCs were dissociated into single cells with TrypLE and transitioned onto a vitronectin-coated plate in E8 media supplemented with 10 μM Y-27632 for 24 hours. Undifferentiated hiPSCs were routinely passaged every 4-6 days by re-seeding them at a density of 5,000-10,000 cells/cm 2 . Subsequently, hiPSCs were adapted to culture on Geltrex-coated plates in mTeSR media. This procedure was used to generate three distinct, clonal hiPSC lines referred to as SUN003.1, SUN004.1 and SUN004.2 (see next section).
SUN003.1, SUN004.1 and SUN004.2 hiPSC lines were engineered to carry constitutively-expressed reporter transgenes to enable the tracking of differentiated progeny cells.
SUN003.1 hiPSCs carry a constitutively-expressed CAG-AkaLuciferase-tdTomato lentiviral transgene. The pCS - CAG-AkaLuciferase-tdTomato lentiviral plasmid was generated by cloning AkaLuciferase ( Iwano et al., 2018 48. Iwano, S. ∙ Sugiyama, M. ∙ Hama, H. ...

Inhibition of apoptosis overcomes stage-related compatibility barriers to chimera formation in mouse embryos Cell Stem Cell. 2016; 19 :587-592 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar ), such that AkaLuciferase and tdTomato are expressed together as an in-frame fusion protein. Lentivirus was then generated using the LV-MAX Lentiviral Production System (Gibco, A35684) as per the manufacturer’s protocol. SUN003.1 hiPSCs were transduced with the CAG-AkaLuciferase-tdTomato lentivirus, cultured for 7-10 days, and then tdTomato+ hiPSCs were isolated by FACS, thus yielding CAG-AkaLuciferase-tdTomato + SUN003.1 hiPSCs (referring to referring to donor 3, line 1).
SUN004.1.9 hiPSCs carry a constitutively-expressed CAG-eGFP PiggyBac transgene. To integrate the PiggyBac transposon, SUN004.1 hiPSCs were seeded into 1 well of a 6-well plate at a density of 20,000 cells/cm 2 , and the following day, they were then transfected with 250 μL of transfection mixture, which contained 1.25 μg of donor plasmid ( CAG-GFP PiggyBac donor plasmid), 1.25 μg of helper plasmid ( CMV-PBase , encoding the PiggyBac transposase enzyme) and 7.5 μL of Lipofectamine 3000 (L3000001, Thermo Fisher). 5 to 10 days post-transposition, GFP + hiPSCs that had been successfully transposed were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). The CAG-GFP + SUN004.1.9 hiPSC subclonal line (referring to donor 4, clone 1, subclone 9) was isolated by manually picking and expanding a single GFP + colony.
SUN004.2 hiPSCs carry a constitutively-expressed CAG-mScarlet lentiviral transgene. The pCS-CAG-mScarlet lentiviral plasmid was generated by cloning mScarlet into the pCS-CAG-eGFP plasmid ( Masaki et al., 2016 72. Masaki, H. ∙ Kato-Itoh, M. ∙ Takahashi, Y. ... Inhibition of apoptosis overcomes stage-related compatibility barriers to chimera formation in mouse embryos Cell Stem Cell. 2016; 19 :587-592 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar ). Lentivirus production and transduction of SUN004.2 hiPSCs was performed as described above, and then 7-10 days post-transduction, mScarlet + hiPSCs were isolated by FACS, thus yielding CAG-mScarlet + SUN004.2 hiPSCs (referring to referring to donor 4, line 2).
Undifferentiated and differentiated hPSCs were dissociated by incubation in TrypLE Express (Gibco) for 5 minutes at 37°C. Subsequently, dissociated cells in TrypLE Express were diluted 1:5-1:10 in DMEM/F12 and centrifuged (pelleted) at 500g for 5 minutes. Each cell pellet was resuspended in FACS buffer (PBS + 1 mM EDTA [Invitrogen] + 2% v/v FBS [Atlanta Bio] + 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin [Gibco]) supplemented with fluorescently-conjugated primary antibodies, and antibody staining occurred for 30 minutes on ice protected from light. After staining, cells were washed twice with FACS buffer and resuspended in 200 μL FACS buffer with DAPI (1:10,000, Biolegend) for live/dead discrimination. Flow cytometry was performed on a BD Biosciences FACSAria II flow cytometer or a Beckman Coulter CytoFlex analyzer (Stanford Stem Cell Institute FACS Core). For data analysis, cells were gated based on forward and side scatter area parameter, followed by height and width parameters for doublet discrimination. Subsequently, live cells that were negative for DAPI were gated for all marker analyses and calculations of population frequency.
Undifferentiated or differentiated hPSCs were lysed in 350 μL of RLT Plus Buffer and RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. 300 ng of total RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA for qPCR using the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. qPCR was performed in 384-well format as previously described ( Loh et al., 2016 66. Loh, K.M. ∙ Chen, A. ∙ Koh, P.W. ... Mapping the pairwise choices leading from pluripotency to human bone, heart, and other mesoderm cell types Cell. 2016; 166 :451-467 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (215) PubMed Google Scholar ), using gene-specific forward and reverse primers on a QuantStudio 5 qPCR machine (Thermo Fisher). qPCR primer sequences are provided in Table S5 . Expression of all genes was normalized to the levels of the reference gene YWHAZ . This qPCR procedure was only used for biosafety level 2 (BSL2) cell cultures. A separate qPCR procedure was used for biosafety level 4 (BSL4) materials, and is detailed further below.
Cultured monolayer cells were fixed, permeabilized and immunostained as previously described ( Loh et al., 2016 66. Loh, K.M. ∙ Chen, A. ∙ Koh, P.W. ... Mapping the pairwise choices leading from pluripotency to human bone, heart, and other mesoderm cell types Cell. 2016; 166 :451-467 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (215) PubMed Google Scholar ). Imaging was conducted using an FV3000 confocal microscope (Olympus).
H1 NR2F2-2A-GFP knock-in hPSCs and H1 SOX17-2A-mPlum knock-in hPSCs were genetically engineered using the Cas9/AAV6 system ( Martin et al., 2019 71. Martin, R.M. ∙ Ikeda, K. ∙ Cromer, M.K. ... Highly efficient and marker-free genome editing of human pluripotent stem cells by CRISPR-Cas9 RNP and AAV6 donor-mediated homologous recombination Cell Stem Cell. 2019; 24 :821-828.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ). This genomic knock-in strategy entails the electroporation of hPSCs with a Cas9-sgRNA ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex (to create a double-stranded break at a desired genomic locus), and delivery of a donor template for homologous recombination, supplied by AAV6 ( Martin et al., 2019 71. Martin, R.M. ∙ Ikeda, K. ∙ Cromer, M.K. ... Highly efficient and marker-free genome editing of human pluripotent stem cells by CRISPR-Cas9 RNP and AAV6 donor-mediated homologous recombination Cell Stem Cell. 2019; 24 :821-828.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ).
In brief, hPSCs were treated with 10 μM ROCK inhibitor (Y-27632) 24 hours prior to genome editing. hPSCs at 70-80% confluence were then dissociated using Accutase (Life Technologies) followed by neutralization with ROCK inhibitor-supplemented mTeSR1 media. Prior to electroporation, RNP complex was formed by combining 5 μg of HiFi SpCas9 (Integrated DNA Technologies) and 1.75 μg of sgRNA for 10 minutes at room temperature, which was then diluted with 20 μL of P3 Primary Cell Solution buffer (Lonza). For each electroporation reaction, 500,000 hPSCs were mixed with the Cas9/sgRNA RNP-containing nucleofection solution. Nucleofection was performed using a 16-well Nucleocuvette Strip with the 4D Nucleofector system (Lonza) using the CA137 electroporation code. Following electroporation, cells were transferred into one well of a Matrigel-coated 24-well plate containing 500 μL of mTeSR1 media supplemented with 10 μM Y-27632. AAV6 donor vector (encoding NR2F2-2A-GFP and SOX17-2A-mPlum donor templates for homologous recombination) was added at 100,000 multiplicity of infection (MOI) directly to hPSCs immediately after plating. Cells were then incubated at 37°C for 24 hours. Media was changed 24 hours post-editing and 10 μM Y-27632 was removed 48 hours after.
The NR2F2 and SOX17 synthetic sgRNAs were purchased from Synthego with chemically-modified nucleotides at the three terminal positions at both the 5′ and 3′ ends. Modified nucleotides contained 2′-O-methyl 3′-phosphorothioate: • NR2F2 sgRNA: AUUUAUUGAAUUGCCAUAUA • SOX17 sgRNA: CUGCAGGCUGGGGCGGAUCA
The EFNB2 gene was deleted in H1 hPSCs using the aforementioned Cas9 protocol (section “Genome editing to create knock-in fluorescent reporter hPSCs”; Martin et al., 2019 71. Martin, R.M. ∙ Ikeda, K. ∙ Cromer, M.K. ... Highly efficient and marker-free genome editing of human pluripotent stem cells by CRISPR-Cas9 RNP and AAV6 donor-mediated homologous recombination Cell Stem Cell. 2019; 24 :821-828.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ), with the exception that Cas9 RNPs were used to generate indels in the EFNB2 locus, but no templates for homologous recombination were provided. This procedure was repeated twice: the initial round of gene targeting produced EFNB2 +/- hPSCs, which were then re-electroporated with Cas9 RNP targeting EFNB2 , thereby generating EFNB2 -/- hPSCs.
sgRNAs targeting the EFNB2 locus were designed using CHOPCHOP ( Labun et al., 2019 57. Labun, K. ∙ Montague, T.G. ∙ Krause, M. ... CHOPCHOP v3: expanding the CRISPR web toolbox beyond genome editing Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 :W171-W174 Crossref Scopus (403) PubMed Google Scholar ) and verified using the COSMID program ( Cradick et al., 2014 24. Cradick, T.J. ∙ Qiu, P. ∙ Lee, C.M. ... Cosmid: a web-based tool for identifying and validating CRISPR/Cas off-target sites Mol. Ther. Nucleic Acids. 2014; 3 :e214 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (223) PubMed Google Scholar ). The EFNB2 synthetic sgRNA was purchased from Synthego with chemically-modified nucleotides at the three terminal positions at both the 5' and 3' ends. Modified nucleotides contained 2'-O-methyl 3'-phosphorothioate. The genomic sgRNA target sequence was: • EFNB2 sgRNA: AGGCUCUAAAACUAUCGAUU
Three different types of endothelial cells were used in the formation of in vitro vascular networks in fibrin hydrogels. Where indicated, 1 ) hPSC-derived artery endothelial cells, 2 ) hPSC-derived vein endothelial cells, or 3 ) umbilical cord blood-derived endothelial colony forming cells (CB-ECFC, a positive control ( Kurokawa et al., 2017 56. Kurokawa, Y.K. ∙ Yin, R.T. ∙ Shang, M.R. ... Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived endothelial cells for three-dimensional microphysiological systems Tissue Eng. Part C Methods. 2017; 23 :474-484 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar )) were utilized.
hPSC-derived artery and vein cells were frozen and thawed (as described above), and after thawing, were cultured in EGM2 medium for 3 days (supplemented with 2 μM Thiazovivin for the first 24 hours). EGM2 media was refreshed every 24 hours for the 3-day period. After 3 days of expansion, hPSC-derived artery and vein endothelial cells and normal human lung fibroblasts (NHLFs) were used to produce 3D endothelial networks as described previously ( Kurokawa et al., 2017 56. Kurokawa, Y.K. ∙ Yin, R.T. ∙ Shang, M.R. ... Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived endothelial cells for three-dimensional microphysiological systems Tissue Eng. Part C Methods. 2017; 23 :474-484 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, hPSC-derived endothelial cells and normal human lung fibroblasts (NHLFs) were respectively dissociated using 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA (Thermo Fisher, 25300062). The cells were then mixed at a ratio of 1 endothelial cell:2 fibroblasts. The resultant cell mixture was centrifuged at 300g for 5 min, and resuspended in 10 mg/mL of bovine fibrinogen (Sigma-Aldrich, F8630). 50 μL of the cell-fibrinogen solution was then placed inside of a small chamber consisting of cured polydimethylsiloxane (Sylgard 184) on glass, and clotted using thrombin from bovine plasma (Sigma-Aldrich T4648). The final thrombin concentration in the 10 mg/mL fibrin hydrogel was 2 unit/mL (which allowed for clotting of the fibrinogen into fibrin). After complete clotting of the hydrogels, the resultant fibrin hydrogels were submerged in 500 μL EGM2 and cultured in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 humidified incubator. EGM2 media changes occurred every 1-2 days with fresh, warm EGM2. After 7 days of culture to allow for network formation in EGM2, hydrogels were fixed using 10% formalin (Sigma F5554) in order to undergo immunofluorescent analysis. Briefly, hydrogels were blocked using 2% BSA (Sigma A2153) in PBS+0.1% Tween-20 (Sigma P9416), after which antibodies were used to stain the tissues overnight at 4 °C. Images were then taken on a fluorescent inverted microscope (Olympus IX83). Resultant image analysis and image preparation was performed using Fiji.
hPSCs were differentiated into artery and vein endothelial cells as described above. Then, hPSC-derived artery cells were cultured in EGM2 for 1 day while vein endothelial cells were cultured in EGM2 + SB505124 (2 μM) + RO4929097 (2 μM) for 1 day, until they formed a confluent monolayer. Then, media was removed and cells were washed with DMEM/F12 before being scratched with a P200 pipette tip affixed to the end of a P200 pipette. After cells were scratched, floating cells were washed away with DMEM/F12. Then, artery expansion media (EGM2) was added to artery endothelial cells and vein expansion media (EGM2 + SB505124 (2 μM) + RO4929097 (2 μM)) was added to vein endothelial cells. Media was replaced every 24 hours. Cells were imaged 0, 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours after scratching, using the Leica Paula Microscope. For image acquisition, tape was used on the microscope stage to mark the perimeter of the cell culture plate after scratching such that for images taken at different timepoints, the image was acquired at the same location every time. To quantify the closure of the gap, each image was set to scale using ImageJ. Then, using the ImageJ measurement tool, the length of the gap between both borders of the closing cell monolayer were measured at 6 different locations.
hPSC-derived day-3 artery endothelial cells were cultured in a 6-well plate with EGM2 medium for 24 hours, either in static culture (standard conditions) or a rotator (shear stress conditions). hPSC-derived day-4 vein endothelial cells were magnetically enriched for CD34 + cells (Miltenyi Biotec) and cultured for 1 week in EGM2 media prior to exposure to shear stress for 24 hours as per above. Shear stress conditions were described previously and entailed culturing cells on a 6-well plate on an orbital shaker ( Poduri et al., 2017 93. Poduri, A. ∙ Chang, A.H. ∙ Raftrey, B. ... Endothelial cells respond to the direction of mechanical stimuli through SMAD signaling to regulate coronary artery size Development. 2017; 144 :3241-3252 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ). After 24 hours of static or shear stress conditions, both immunostaining and qPCR was performed.
After exposure to static media or shear stress for 24 hours, immunostaining was performed to quantify the degree of cell alignment. To this end, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 15 minutes at 4 °C. Then, the cells were washed with PBS for three times, waiting 5 minutes between each wash. After washing, cells were incubated in 4 °C overnight with primary antibody in 0.5% Triton X-100/PBS solution. Next, cells were washed with PBS for three times, waiting 15 minutes between each wash. Afterwards, the cells were incubated with secondary antibody in 0.5% Triton X-100/PBS solution. Secondary antibody was removed and DAPI in PBS was added and incubated for 5 minutes. Then, the cells were washed with 0.5% Triton X-100/PBS three times, waiting 15 minutes between each wash. Finally, PBS was added to the cells, and imaging was conducted using a Keyence BZ-9000 microscope.
After imaging, quantification of cell alignment was performed using ImageJ. Cell directionality analysis was done using the “Directionality” plugin, using Fourier components analysis with Nbins=90, producing a directionality histogram which starts at -90 degrees and ends at +90 degrees.
hPSC-derived day 3 artery and day 4 vein endothelial cells were washed with DMEM/F12 (Thermo Fisher) and incubated at 37°C for 4 hours with either a 1:25 concentration of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) conjugated with DyLight550 (Cayman) or a 5 μg/mL concentration of acetylated LDL conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (Fisher Scientific) in their respective differentiation media. As a negative control, hPSC-derived day 3 artery and day 4 vein endothelial cells were incubated in their respective differentiation media without LDL DyLight 550 or acetylated LDL Alexa 488. After incubation, cells were dissociated by incubating them in TrypLE Express (Gibco) for 5 minutes at 37 °C. Subsequently, the dissociated cells were diluted 1:10 in DMEM/F12 and centrifuged at 500g for 5 minutes. Each cell pellet was then resuspended in FACS buffer (DPBS + 5 mM EDTA [Invitrogen] + 0.5% BSA) supplemented with anti-CD144 antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 647 (BD Biosciences) and incubated on ice for 30 minutes, while being protected from light. After antibody staining, cells were washed twice with FACS buffer and resuspended in 300 μL FACS buffer containing DAPI (1:10,000, Biolegend). Then the resuspended cells were passed through a 100 μm strainer (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using a FACSAria II flow cytometer (Stanford Stem Cell Institute FACS Core). During flow cytometry data analysis, we gated on CD144 + endothelial cells before quantifying fluorescent LDL or acetylated LDL uptake by endothelial cells.
The THP1 human monocyte-like cell line was fluorescently labelled with CFSE and then cocultured with hPSC-derived endothelial cells to assess immune cell adhesion to endothelial cells. Methods to assess adhesion of immune cells to endothelial cells were modified from previously-published protocols ( Rosa et al., 2019 102. Rosa, S. ∙ Praça, C. ∙ Pitrez, P.R. ... Functional characterization of iPSC-derived arterial- and venous-like endothelial cells Sci. Rep. 2019; 9 :3826 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhang et al., 2017 126. Zhang, J. ∙ Chu, L.-F. ∙ Hou, Z. ... Functional characterization of human pluripotent stem cell-derived arterial endothelial cells. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of The United States of America 2017 201702295 Crossref Google Scholar ).
First, THP1 cells were fluorescently labelled with CFSE, largely as per the manufacturer’s recommendations. THP1 cells were resuspended in DMEM/F12 at a concentration of 1 million cells/mL and then incubated with 5 μM of CellTrace CFSE (Thermo Fisher Scientific, C34554) for 20 minutes at room temperature, protected from light, and with occasional pipetting to keep cells resuspended during the staining process. After 20 minutes of incubation, the cell suspension was diluted 1:5 in RPMI1640 + 10% FBS for 5 minutes. Then, cells were centrifuged at 300g for 5 minutes, the supernatant was aspirated, and then fresh RPMI1640 + 10% FBS was added.
Separately, hPSC-derived artery and vein endothelial cells cultured in 12-well plates were stimulated with the inflammatory cytokine TNFα (10 ng/mL) for 4 hours in their respective culture media (EGM2 for artery cells and EGM2 + RO4929097 (2μM) + SB505124 (2μM) for vein cells) at 37 °C. As a negative control, artery and vein cells were cultured in their respective culture media in the absence of TNFα.
Subsequently, Hoechst dye (1 μg/mL) was added in the dark for 5 minutes to fluorescently label the nuclei of live artery and vein cells. Then, cells were washed with DMEM/F12. After washing, CFSE-labelled THP-1 immune cells (described above) were added to each well in a 12-well plate at 1 million cells/well in EGM2 media for 30 minutes at 37 °C. After this 30-minute coculture of THP1 and endothelial cells, the wells were washed 3 times with DMEM/F12 to remove any non-adhered THP1 cells. Images were taken using a Keyence BZ-9000 fluorescence microscope and quantification of the number of adhered THP1 cells was performed using ImageJ/Fiji.
The sprouting assay was performed as previously described ( Nakatsu et al., 2007 79. Nakatsu, M.N. ∙ Davis, J. ∙ Hughes, C.C.W. Optimized fibrin gel bead assay for the study of angiogenesis J. Vis. Exp. 2007; 3 :186 PubMed Google Scholar ), with modifications. First, CAG-GFP + SUN004.1.9 hPSC-derived artery or vein ECs were thawed and respectively maintained in artery or vein expansion media (EGM2 for artery ECs and EGM2 + RO4929097 (2 μM) + SB505124 (2 μM) for vein ECs) for 24 hours until they were fully confluent. Second, ECs were cultured with EGM2 + 10% heat-inactivated FBS for 24 hours, prior to dissociating them for the sprouting assay. Third, hPSC-derived artery and vein ECs were dissociated using trypsin and counted. In parallel, Cytodex-3 beads (Sigma Aldrich, C3275) were allowed to settle for 5 minutes, and were washed briefly in 1 mL of warm EGM2 media before removing the media. Fourth, Cytodex-3 beads were coated with hPSC-derived ECs by incubating them at a concentration of ∼400 cells/bead in 1.5 mL of warm EGM2 media. The bead/cell suspension was incubated for 4 hours at 37°C, with gentle pipetting every 20 minutes. After 4 hours, the EC-coated beads were transferred to a well of a non-tissue-culture-treated 24-well plate and left overnight in EGM2 + 10% heat-inactivated FBS. The EC-coated beads were then transferred to a 15 mL conical tube and left to settle for 5 minutes, followed by three washes with warm EGM2, and then the beads were counted on a coverslip.
To embed EC-coated beads in a 3D fibrin gel, beads were resuspended in sterilely-filtered fibrinogen solution (2.0 mg/mL, Sigma Aldrich, F8630) at a concentration of ∼500 beads/mL, and 0.5 mL of the fibrinogen/bead suspension was added to each well of a 24-well plate. Then, 0.5 mL of thrombin (0.625 units/mL, Sigma Aldrich, T3399) was added and the bead-fibrinogen-thrombin mixture was triturated ∼4-5 times, with care to avoid the formation of bubbles. The plate was left in the hood for 5 minutes, and then incubated at 37° C for 10 minutes to generate fibrin gels. After the gels formed, 1 mL of EGM2 media + 10% FBS was added dropwise. Gels were incubated at 37°C for 24 hours in order for GFP + endothelial sprouts to emerge. At the end of the assay, EGM2 was removed and the gels were washed with DPBS prior to overnight fixation in 4% paraformaldyde. Gels were imaged using a fluorescence microscope. The number of sprouts per bead and the length of each sprout was quantitated on at least five beads using MetaMorph software.
The chemotaxis assay was performed as previously reported ( Kälin et al., 2007 49. Kälin, R.E. ∙ Kretz, M.P. ∙ Meyer, A.M. ... Paracrine and autocrine mechanisms of apelin signaling govern embryonic and tumor angiogenesis Dev. Biol. 2007; 305 :599-614 Crossref Scopus (154) PubMed Google Scholar ), with modifications. The polycarbonate membrane of a Transwell filter (with 8 μm pores; Corning, 3422) was coated with 0.1% gelatin overnight. Separately, CAG-GFP + SUN004.1.9 hPSC-derived artery or vein ECs were respectively maintained in artery or vein expansion media (EGM2 for artery ECs and EGM2 + RO4929097 (2 μM) + SB505124 (2 μM) for vein ECs) until they were fully confluent. hPSC-derived artery or vein ECs were then dissociated using trypsin and resuspended in Endothelial Basal Media 2 media (EBM2, Lonza) at concentration of 1.5 × 10 5 cells/mL. Then, 100 μL of the cell suspension was added to the upper chamber of the gelatin-coated Transwell filter, and 600 μL of EBM2 media + Apelin-13 (100 ng/mL, Tocris, 2420) was added to the lower chamber. Cells were incubated at 37°C for 4 hours to allow for cell migration towards the lower chamber. Then, non-migratory cells were removed with a cotton swab. Migratory cells on the bottom of the Transwell membrane were fixed and stained with DAPI. Cells were imaged under a fluorescence microscope and counted using ImageJ software.
SUN003.1 CAG-AkaLuciferase-tdTomato hPSC-derived ECs were subcutaneously transplanted into adult, immunodeficient NOD-SCID Il2rg -/- (NSG) mice. In brief, hPSC-derived endothelial cells were suspended in a 1:1 mixture of Matrigel (phenol-free, growth factor reduced) + F12 medium (supplemented with 100 ng/mL FGF2 and 50 ng/mL VEGF). NSG mice were then anesthetized with 2% isoflurane and 100% oxygen flowing at 2 liters/minute until they were unconscious and unresponsive to stimuli (i.e., a toe pinch). A fold of skin directly lateral to the spine and near the neck was swabbed with ethanol in order to disinfect it, and then was gently pinched. A volume of 50-200 μL containing ∼10 6 cells suspended in the Matrigel + F12 + FGF2 + VEGF solution was then injected under the skin flap using a 27-gauge syringe. Anesthesia was then discontinued, and mice were allowed to recover in a warm cage until they became alert and awake.
1 month post-transplantation, NSG mice were sacrificed, and subcutaneous gels containing hPSC-derived ECs were recovered and then fixed in 4% formaldehyde overnight at 4 °C. Fixed gels were then placed in PBT buffer (PBS with 0.5% Triton-X) with primary antibodies and incubated overnight at 4 °C on a shaker. The next day, samples were washed every 1.5 hours in PBT buffer for approximately 8 hours at room temperature, and with gentle agitation. Subsequently, Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibodies (Life Technologies) were then added in PBT buffer at a 1:250 concentration and incubated overnight at 4 °C on a shaker. Finally, the stained samples were washed every 1.5 hours with PBT buffer for approximately 8 hours and cleared using Vectashield (Vector Labs, H-1000). Samples were then placed in a microscope chamber and imaged using a Zeiss LSM-700 confocal microscope. Image processing was done in ImageJ.
We executed single-cell RNA-seq on H1 hPSC-derived day 3 artery ECs and day 4 vein ECs using the 10x Genomics Chromium v3 platform ( Zheng et al., 2017 127. Zheng, G.X.Y. ∙ Terry, J.M. ∙ Belgrader, P. ... Massively parallel digital transcriptional profiling of single cells Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :14049 Crossref Scopus (2096) PubMed Google Scholar ). Libraries were prepared using the 10x Genomics Chromium 3’ Kit v3 following the manufacturer’s guidelines. Libraries were prepared with i7 indices (compatible with Illumina sequencers) and then multiplexed. Multiplexed libraries were sequenced across multiple lanes of an Illumina HiSeq 4000 sequencer by Novogene. Unique sequences in each i7 index were used for demultiplexing. Cell Ranger (10x Genomics) was used to perform read alignment to the hg38 reference genome, filtering, barcode counting and UMI counting.
Cell matrix files generated from Cell Ranger were imported into RStudio using the function “Read10x_h5” in Seurat v3 ( Stuart et al., 2019 111. Stuart, T. ∙ Butler, A. ∙ Hoffman, P. ... Comprehensive integration of single-cell data Cell. 2019; 177 :1888-1902.e21 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (3719) PubMed Google Scholar ). We then implemented well-established quality control procedures to exclude dying/dead cells that 1 ) expressed low numbers of genes, 2 ) displayed too low or too high mitochondrial counts, or 3 ) did not express reference/housekeeping genes ACTB or YWHAZ ; additionally, we also 4 ) computationally excluded doublets by removing cells that had expressed markedly higher numbers of genes. Only high-quality single-cell transcriptomes that passed these quality control metrics were used for subsequent analyses. scRNAseq data were normalized using the “LogNormalized” function and scaled using a linear transformation in Seurat v3 ( Stuart et al., 2019 111. Stuart, T. ∙ Butler, A. ∙ Hoffman, P. ... Comprehensive integration of single-cell data Cell. 2019; 177 :1888-1902.e21 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (3719) PubMed Google Scholar ). Expression of marker genes was denoted by different color shades and superimposed over the entire cell population, as visualized on a Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) projection ( Becht et al., 2018 9. Becht, E. ∙ McInnes, L. ∙ Healy, J. ... Dimensionality reduction for visualizing single-cell data using UMAP Nat. Biotechnol. 2018; 37 :38-44 Crossref Scopus (1416) Google Scholar ). Importantly, all cells within the entire day 3 and day 4 differentiated populations were shown on the UMAP projection, without any pre-selection of ECs.
An interactive web portal ( Ouyang et al., 2021 88. Ouyang, J.F. ∙ Kamaraj, U.S. ∙ Cao, E.Y. ...

We used scRNAseq to quantify the degree of transcriptional similarity between hPSC-derived artery and vein ECs ( in vitro ; described above) as well as human artery and vein ECs obtained from a Carnegie Stage 13 (CS13) human fetus ( in vivo ). scRNAseq data of CS13 human fetal artery and vein ECs were generated previously ( Zeng et al., 2019 125. Zeng, Y. ∙ He, J. ∙ Bai, Z. ... Tracing the first hematopoietic stem cell generation in human embryo by single-cell RNA sequencing Cell Res. 2019; 29 :881-894 Crossref Scopus (77) PubMed Google Scholar ) and were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE135202). Importantly, both in vivo and in vitro EC datasets were generated using the 10x Genomics Chromium platform ( Zheng et al., 2017 127. Zheng, G.X.Y. ∙ Terry, J.M. ∙ Belgrader, P. ... Massively parallel digital transcriptional profiling of single cells Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :14049 Crossref Scopus (2096) PubMed Google Scholar ), thus mitigating concerns that would otherwise arise from a cross-platform comparison.
We performed quality control and normalization for CS13 human fetal scRNAseq data using the methods described above for hPSC-derived artery and vein ECs (section “Single-cell RNA-sequencing”). In brief, dead/dying cells as well as doublets were computationally excluded and then CS13 human fetal scRNAseq data were normalized using the “LogNormalized” function and scaled using a linear transformation in Seurat v3 ( Stuart et al., 2019 111. Stuart, T. ∙ Butler, A. ∙ Hoffman, P. ... Comprehensive integration of single-cell data Cell. 2019; 177 :1888-1902.e21 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (3719) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To decompose the CS13 human fetal scRNAseq dataset into its constituent cell-types, we used Seurat v3 ( Stuart et al., 2019 111. Stuart, T. ∙ Butler, A. ∙ Hoffman, P. ... Comprehensive integration of single-cell data Cell. 2019; 177 :1888-1902.e21 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (3719) PubMed Google Scholar ) to perform Louvain clustering (resolution 0.05), which separated the fetal cell population into 4 subsets: artery ECs ( CDH5+, PECAM1+, DLL4+, CXCR4+, HEY1+ ); vein ECs ( CDH5+, PECAM1+, NT5E+, APLNR+, NR2F2+, NRP2+ ); mesenchymal ( TWIST2+ CXCL12 + DLK1+ HAND1+ FBLN5+ WT1+ ), and epithelial cells ( EPCAM+, CDX2+ ). The existence of these 4 clusters—and the marker genes used to discriminate them—are consistent with what was reported in the original report that described these scRNAseq data ( Zeng et al., 2019 125. Zeng, Y. ∙ He, J. ∙ Bai, Z. ... Tracing the first hematopoietic stem cell generation in human embryo by single-cell RNA sequencing Cell Res. 2019; 29 :881-894 Crossref Scopus (77) PubMed Google Scholar ). Next, we focused our analysis only on the fetal ECs: we selected cells that expressed pan-endothelial genes ( PECAM1 and CDH5 ) at a level of UMI > 1.221 (i.e., UMI e 0 . 2 ) in both the CS13 artery and CS13 vein subpopulations for downstream analyses.
In parallel, we computationally isolated ECs from our scRNAseq datasets of hPSC-derived day 3 artery and day 4 vein ECs in vitro . Louvain clustering (resolution = 0.1) was applied using Seurat v3 ( Stuart et al., 2019 111. Stuart, T. ∙ Butler, A. ∙ Hoffman, P. ... Comprehensive integration of single-cell data Cell. 2019; 177 :1888-1902.e21 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (3719) PubMed Google Scholar ), which decomposed the day 3 population into artery ECs ( CDH5 +, PECAM1 +, CD34+, SOX17 +, CXCR4 +, DLL4 +) vs. non-ECs; similarly, this procedure decomposed the day 4 population into vein ECs ( CDH5 +, PECAM1 +, CD34+, NR2F2 +, NT5E +, FLRT2 +) vs. non-ECs. The hPSC-derived artery ECs and vein ECs were computationally isolated and then used for subsequent analyses.
We then merged our in vitro scRNAseq dataset—composed of hPSC-derived day 3 artery ECs and day 4 vein ECs, in addition to other in vitro cell-types—with the CS13 human fetal artery and vein EC dataset. The combined scRNAseq dataset was normalized and scaled using SCTransform ( Hafemeister and Satija, 2019 43. Hafemeister, C. ∙ Satija, R. Normalization and variance stabilization of single-cell RNA-seq data using regularized negative binomial regression Genome Biol. 2019; 20 :296 Crossref Scopus (742) PubMed Google Scholar ) to remove technical variation while retaining biological variation. Next, we calculated the average expression of each gene in the SCTransform-normalized dataset (containing both in vivo and in vitro ECs) using the “AverageExpression” function in Seurat v3 ( Stuart et al., 2019 111. Stuart, T. ∙ Butler, A. ∙ Hoffman, P. ... Comprehensive integration of single-cell data Cell. 2019; 177 :1888-1902.e21 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (3719) PubMed Google Scholar ). We then identified the top 6000 variable genes in this merged dataset using the “CellScatter” function.
On the basis of the expression of these 6000 variable genes, we calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient 1) between our hPSC-derived artery ECs vs. CS13 human fetal artery ECs and 2) between our hPSC-derived vein ECs vs. CS13 human fetal vein ECs.
To find differentially-expressed genes between hPSC-derived vs. CS13 fetal artery and vein ECs, we used the function “FindMarkers” in Seurat v3 ( Stuart et al., 2019 111. Stuart, T. ∙ Butler, A. ∙ Hoffman, P. ... Comprehensive integration of single-cell data Cell. 2019; 177 :1888-1902.e21 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (3719) PubMed Google Scholar ), with parameters set to only identify genes that were expressed in at least 25% of cells within that subcluster. This identified the most differentially-expressed genes between 1 ) hPSC-derived vs. human fetal artery ECs and 2 ) hPSC-derived vs. human fetal vein ECs. Of these genes that strongly differed in expression levels between in vitro -derived vs. in vivo ECs, we manually annotated those that had been previously linked to ribosome translation ( GNB2L1 , EEF1G , RPL17 , RPS17 ) and mitochondrial respiration ( ATP5G2 , ATP5E , ATP5L , MT-ND2 , MT-ND1 , MT-ND4 , MT-CTB , MT-CO1 , MT-ATP6 , MT-CO2 , MT-CO3 , MT-CTB ). Finally, we performed gene ontology analysis on the lists of genes differentially expressed between hPSC-derived vs. CS13 fetal ECs using the online Enrichr platform ( Chen et al., 2013 16. Chen, E.Y. ∙ Tan, C.M. ∙ Kou, Y. ... Enrichr: interactive and collaborative HTML5 gene list enrichment analysis tool BMC Bioinformatics. 2013; 14 :128 Crossref Scopus (2789) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kuleshov et al., 2016 54.

Enrichr: a comprehensive gene set enrichment analysis web server 2016 update Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44 :W90-W97 Crossref Scopus (3602) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We performed bulk-population RNA-seq on H1 hPSC-derived day 3 artery ECs and day 4 vein ECs, both of which were FACS purified for CD144 + ECs to exclude any spurious gene expression from contaminating non-ECs. Cells were lysed using Zymo RNA lysis buffer and RNA was extracted using the Zymo Quick RNA kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. We determined the RNA integrity number (RIN) of each sample using Agilent Bioanalyzer on-chip electrophoresis, and high-quality RNA samples with RIN ≥ 8 were enriched for poly(A) sequences and used to construct RNA-seq libraries, which were then ligated to adaptors for multiplexing. RNA-seq libraries were then sequenced on the DNBSEQ-G400 sequencer using DNA nanoball and combinational probe anchor synthesis technology by BGI Global Genomic Services to generate 150-bp paired-end reads. To minimize batch effects, all libraries were pooled together into a single sample, which was then sequenced on multiple lanes.
After obtaining RNA-seq reads, we performed quality control using FastQC ( Andrews, 2010 2. Andrews, S. FastQC: A quality control tool for high throughput sequence data http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/ Date: 2010 Google Scholar ). Next, we used Trim Galore ( Krueger, 2012 53. Krueger, F. Trim galore https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/ Date: 2012 Google Scholar ) to remove index adaptors, low-quality base-calls or reads less than 20bp, using a read quality cutoff Phred score of 33. Trimmed and filtered reads from each single library (which was originally sequenced on multiple lanes) were then merged into a pooled file, each representing a single library. Subsequently reads were aligned with the GRCh38 (hg38) Homo sapiens reference genome and gene-level RNA-seq counts were quantified using Kallisto ( Bray et al., 2016 11. Bray, N.L. ∙ Pimentel, H. ∙ Melsted, P. ... Near-optimal probabilistic RNA-seq quantification Nat. Biotechnol. 2016; 34 :525-527 Crossref Scopus (3483) PubMed Google Scholar ). We then filtered and log 2 normalized counts per million (Tidyverse, BaseR, and EdgeR) ( Robinson et al., 2010 100. Robinson, M.D. ∙ McCarthy, D.J. ∙ Smyth, G.K. edgeR: a Bioconductor package for differential expression analysis of digital gene expression data Bioinformatics. 2010; 26 :139-140 Crossref Scopus (19590) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wickham et al., 2019 120. Wickham, H. ∙ Averick, M. ∙ Bryan, J. ... Welcome to the Tidyverse J. Open Source Software. 2019; 4 Crossref Google Scholar ). Then, we performed dimensional reduction and differential gene expression analyses (Limma and EdgeR) ( Law et al., 2014 58. Law, C.W. ∙ Chen, Y. ∙ Shi, W. ... voom: precision weights unlock linear model analysis tools for RNA-seq read counts Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :R29 Crossref Scopus (2673) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ritchie et al., 2015 99.

These data were visualized on volcano plots: genes that showed a log 2 fold differences less than 3 (i.e., less than 8-fold differential expression) were represented in gray, while differentially expressed genes (i.e., those with greater than 8-fold expression differences) were highlighted in distinct colors.
Non-replicating, GFP -expressing lentiviruses pseudotyped to solely display Nipah or vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) envelope proteins were generated from HEK293T/17 packaging cells using a 3 rd generation lentiviral packaging system. In brief, cell-culture plates were coated with poly-L-lysine (R&D Systems, 3438-200-01) for 5 minutes at room temperature, which was then aspirated. Then 1 million HEK293T/17 cells (ATCC, CRL-11268) were seeded onto each poly-L-lysine-coated well of a 6-well plate. 24 hours after seeding, HEK293T/17 cells were ∼80-90% confluent and they were transfected using FuGENE HD (Promega, E2311).
The following lentiviral packaging plasmids encoding Nipah or VSV envelope proteins were used: • pCAGGS-coNiV-G-HA : Encodes a codon-optimized NiV-G gene whose amino acid product is identical to the protein encoded by the NiV-G reference gene (GenBank: NC_002728.1 : 8710-11255 nucleotides, from Nipah virus/human/MY/1999/CDC), and additionally carries a hemagglutinin (HA) tag ( Palomares et al., 2013 90. Palomares, K. ∙ Vigant, F. ∙ Van Handel, B. ... Nipah virus envelope-pseudotyped lentiviruses efficiently target ephrinB2-positive stem cell populations in vitro and bypass the liver sink when administered in vivo J. Virol. 2013; 87 :2094-2108 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ). Provided by Dr. Benhur Lee’s laboratory (Icahn School of Medicine). • pcDNA3.1-coNiV-F T5F-Au1 : Encodes a codon-optimized NiV-F gene whose amino acid product is a truncated version of the protein encoded by the NiV-F reference gene (GenBank: NC_002728.1 : 6370-8706 nucleotides, from Nipah virus/human/MY/1999/CDC). However 1 ) the cytoplasmic tail of NiV-F was truncated to only carry 5 amino acid residues (a change that improves the production of pseudotyped lentiviruses) and 2 ) additionally it carries an AU1 tag ( Palomares et al., 2013 90. Palomares, K. ∙ Vigant, F. ∙ Van Handel, B. ...

HEK293T/17 cells were transfected using FuGENE HD with the following amounts of lentiviral packaging plasmids per well of a 6-well plate: 1.38 μg pMDL plasmid + 0.53 μg pREV plasmid + 0.76 μg envelope protein-encoding plasmid(s) + 2.13 μg pRS348 EF1A-GFP plasmid. For the envelope protein-encoding plasmid(s), the following amounts were used for: 1 ) VSV pseudovirus (0.76 μg VSV-G plasmid) or 2 ) Nipah pseudovirus (0.37 μg NiV-G plasmid + 0.37 μg NiV-F plasmid). For transfection, room temperature DMEM medium was first mixed with FuGENE, and then mixed with plasmid DNA; after 15 minute incubation at room temperature, the transfection solution was added dropwise to HEK293T/17 cells.
16-20 hours post-transfection, the culture media was replaced with 1mL of pre-warmed DMEM + 10% FBS media. 24 hours media later, the media (containing pseudotyped lentivirus particles encoding a constitutively-expressed EF1A-GFP reporter) was harvested and either immediately used for transduction experiments or frozen at -80 °C.
After Nipah- and VSV-pseudotyped lentiviruses were generated as described above, they were used to transduce hPSC-derived artery and vein endothelial cells. First, wells in a 96-well, flat-bottom plate were coated with Geltrex (50-100 μL/well), which was then aspirated. Subsequently, hPSC-derived artery or vein cells (generated from either wild-type or EFNB2 -/- hPSCs) were thawed and 16,800-67,200 cells were seeded per Geltrex-coated well of a 96-well plate in 100 μL of respective artery or vein expansion media supplemented with the ROCK inhibitor thiazovivin for 24 hours. Artery or vein expansion media was changed every 24 hours, and thiazovivin was withheld after the initial 24 hour seeding period.
72 hours post-seeding, media was removed from artery and vein cells, and then 100 μL of fresh artery or vein expansion media was added, in addition to 0.3-100 μL of viral supernatant containing pseudotyped lentiviruses (or control media lacking pseudotyped viruses). Pseudotyped lentiviruses were added for 24 hours prior to removal of culture media, and subsequently, media was replaced with fresh artery and vein media every 24 hours.
6 days post-seeding (i.e., 3 days post-transduction), each well of artery or vein cells was dissociated through the addition of 50 μL TrypLE Express (incubated at 37 °C, 3-6 minutes) and trituration. Then, 150 μL of FACS buffer was added per well, and cells were transferred into a 96-well V-bottom plate before centrifugation (at 4 °C, 5 minutes). Subsequently, supernatant was aspirated to remove the dissociation buffer, and cells were resuspended in 150 μL of FACS buffer + DAPI per well. Flow cytometry was performed using a CytoFLEX flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter Life Sciences) to enumerate the percentage of GFP + (i.e., virally-transduced) viable cells in each well.
The percentage of GFP + cells was used to quantify the relative efficiency with which a given pseudotyped lentivirus transduces artery vs. vein endothelial cells (i.e., the arteriovenous tropism of a given pseudotyped lentivirus). In brief, artery and vein cells were inoculated with an equal volume of lentiviral supernatant containing Nipah- or VSV-pseudotyped lentivirus and the percentage of GFP + cells were quantified by flow cytometry, as described above. In parallel, wells of artery and vein cells were dissociated and counted to determine cell numbers, in order to correct for any differences in transduction efficiency attributable to the use of different numbers of artery vs. vein cells.
Next, the multiplicity of infection (i.e., after inoculation with a given volume of pseudotyped lentiviruses, the number of pseudotyped lentiviruses per each single cell) was calculated using Poisson statistics as follows. Assuming that, after viral inoculation, the number of viruses that transduces a single cell follows a Poisson distribution ( Ellis and Delbrück, 1939 32. Ellis, E.L. ∙ Delbrück, M. The growth of bacteriophage J. Gen. Physiol. 1939; 22 :365-384 Crossref Scopus (354) PubMed Google Scholar ), then: P(n) = (m n ∗ e -m )/n!, where P(n) is the probability that a cell will be transduced by n number of viruses and m is the multiplicity of infection.
The frequency of non-transduced cells in a given cell population is described by P(n = 0) = e -m . The frequency of transduced cells is described by P(n > 0) = 1 – P(0). Consequently, P(n > 0) = 1 – e -m .
In this case, after transduction with GFP -encoding lentiviruses, P(n > 0) is equivalent to the percentage of GFP + cells in a given cell population (henceforth “GFP + ”). In summary, the multiplicity of infection ( m ) can be described by: m = –ln(1 – GFP + ). In this study, the percentage of GFP + cells was always greater than 60% (i.e., the multiplicity of infection was always less than 0.916), thereby enabling the multiplicity of infection to be accurately determined within the linear range of this quantitative assay. In this manner, the percentage of GFP + artery or vein cells (enumerated by flow cytometry) was used to calculate the multiplicity of infection, which was then multiplied by the number of artery or vein cells to yield the inferred number of pseudotyped lentivirus particles that were originally used to inoculate the artery or vein cells. Given that the same absolute volume of pseudotyped lentivirus was used to inoculate artery or vein cells, any differences in the inferred number of pseudotyped lentivirus particles for artery vs. vein cells must be attributable to differences in the tropism of the pseudotyped lentivirus for artery vs. vein cells. Finally, the inferred number of pseudotyped lentivirus particles used to inoculate artery cells was divided by the inferred number of pseudotyped lentivirus particles used to inoculate vein cells, thus calculating the arteriovenous tropism of Nipah- or VSV-pseudotyped lentiviruses.
Authentic Nipah and Hendra viruses are classified in Risk Group 4 ( CDC and NIH, 2020 15. CDC, NIH Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories United States Department of Health and Human Services, 2020 Google Scholar ). All experiments with Risk Group 4 viruses were conducted under maximum containment conditions in the biosafety level 4 (BSL4) laboratory of the Robert Koch Institute, in accordance with standard operating procedures institutionally approved by the Robert Koch Institute.
For this study, Nipah virus, Malaysia variant (Nipah virus/human/MY/1999/CDC) ( Harcourt et al., 2000 45. Harcourt, B.H. ∙ Tamin, A. ∙ Ksiazek, T.G. ... Molecular characterization of Nipah virus, a newly emergent paramyxovirus Virology. 2000; 271 :334-349 Crossref Scopus (244) PubMed Google Scholar ) and Hendra virus, Brisbane variant (Hendra virus/horse/AU/1994/Hendra) ( Murray et al., 1995 78. Murray, K. ∙ Selleck, P. ∙ Hooper, P. ... A morbillivirus that caused fatal disease in horses and humans Science. 1995; 268 :94-97 Crossref Scopus (565) PubMed Google Scholar ) were obtained from CDC Viral Special Pathogens Branch reference stocks. These viruses were then subsequently propagated on Vero E6 cells (Vero C1008 (Vero 76, clone E6, Vero E6), from the European Collection of Authenticated Cell Cultures (ECACC)) in DMEM + 2% FBS to generate archive stocks, which were frozen at -80°C. As needed, archive stocks were thawed and passaged once more on Vero E6 to generate working stocks of these viruses, which were frozen at -80°C. Working stocks of these viruses were used for all subsequent experiments.
These viral stocks were quantified using the tissue culture infectious dose 50% (TCID 50 ) assay. For viral quantitation, Vero E6 cells were seeded into 96-well tissue culture plates in DMEM containing 10% FBS, 2 mM glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin, at such a density that after overnight plating the cells became 95-100% confluent the following day. Separately, serial 10-fold dilutions of virus stocks were then diluted in DMEM. Then, the Vero E6 culture media was aspirated and 100 μL of viral supernatant was added to triplicate wells of Vero E6 cells. This was incubated for 1 hour at 37 °C, 5% CO 2 . Subsequently, 100 μL of DMEM containing 4% FBS, 4 mM glutamine, and 2% penicillin/streptomycin was added to the wells (such that the final FBS concentration was 2%) and this was incubated for 4-5 days at 37 °C, 5% CO 2 . The cells were then scored for the presence of cytopathic effects (CPE). The endpoint dilution of the viral stock in which 50% of the wells exhibited CPE was calculated using the Spearman-Karber method, therefore quantifying the viral dose present in the original viral stocks (expressed as TCID 50 units/mL). These titrated viral stocks were then used to infect hPSC-derived artery and vein ECs, as described below.
In certain experiments, Sendai virus, Cantell strain ( Cantell and Hirvonen, 1981 12. Cantell, K. ∙ Hirvonen, S. Preparation and assay of Sendai virus Methods Enzymol. 1981; 78 :299-301 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar )—a paramyxovirus not known to cause disease ( López et al., 2006 67. López, C.B. ∙ Yount, J.S. ∙ Hermesh, T. ... Sendai virus infection induces efficient adaptive immunity independently of type I interferons J. Virol. 2006; 80 :4538-4545 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yoshida et al., 2018 124. Yoshida, A. ∙ Kawabata, R. ∙ Honda, T. ... A single amino acid substitution within the paramyxovirus Sendai virus nucleoprotein is a critical determinant for production of interferon-beta-inducing copyback-type defective interfering genomes J. Virol. 2018; 92 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar )—was used as a control for Nipah and Hendra viruses, which are highly-lethal paramyxoviruses. Sendai virus is classified in Risk Group 2, but was handled in the BSL4 laboratory for consistency. Sendai virus, Cantell strain was obtained from ATCC (VR-907).
Prior to viral infection, frozen stocks of hPSC-derived artery and vein ECs were thawed as described above and propagated on Geltrex-coated 24-well plates, 48-well plates or 8-well chamber slides (Ibidi, 80826) in their respective expansion media (EGM2 for artery ECs and EGM2 + RO4929097 + SB505124 for vein ECs) until they became fully confluent, at 4-5 days post-seeding. At that point, they were then transferred into BSL4 containment.
In each experiment, hPSC-derived artery or vein ECs were then inoculated with the same infectious quantity of a given virus. This enabled a side-by-side comparison of the responses of artery vs. vein ECs. Artery and vein ECs were inoculated with viruses for 1 hour (37°C, 5% CO 2 ) in EGM2 medium. Different amounts of virus (titrated as described above) were used in various experiments depending on the objective of the experiment: • Visualization of syncytia formation and cytopathic effects at a fixed timepoint ( Figures 5 A, 5B, and S5 E): 10 4 TCID 50 units of Nipah or Hendra virus were added per well of a 24-well plate • Visualization of syncytia formation through live-imaging ( Figures 5 C–5E, S5 H, and S5I): 10 4 TCID 50 units of Nipah or Hendra virus were added per well of an 8-well chamber slide • Quantification of viral replication kinetics ( Figures 6 A and S6 A): 5×10 3 TCID 50 units of Nipah or Hendra virus were added per well of a 48-well plate • RNA-seq analysis of infected cells ( Figures 7 A–7D and S7 A–S7C): 10 5 TCID 50 units of Nipah or Hendra virus, or 30 HA units of Sendai virus, were added per well of a 24-well plate • IFNβ secretion by infected cells ( Figures 7 E and S7 D): 5×10 4 TCID 50 units of Nipah or Hendra virus, or 15 HA units of Sendai virus, were added per well of a 48-well plate
After 1 hour of incubation with virus, cells were washed twice in EGM2 to remove residual virus in the media. Infected artery and vein ECs were then cultured in their respective arterial or venous expansion media for various lengths of time, as described for each individual experiment. Media was changed every 24 hours.
To visualize cytopathic effects, Diff-Quik staining (Labor+Technik, LT 001) was performed on hPSC-derived ECs that had been infected with Nipah virus, Hendra virus or left uninfected for 24 hours. For each condition, 5 fields of view were randomly selected and imaged. In each image, the number of total nuclei as well as syncytia were quantified using ImageJ/Fiji. To count multinucleated cells, ImageJ/Fiji’s cell counter was used to label and tally the total number of cells with 1 nucleus or ≥2 nuclei. To count the total number of cells, multiple ImageJ/Fiji plugins were used to process the images automatically. Images were converted to 8-bit format, and then thresholded, smoothened and filtered to remove noise (despeckled). In each image, overlapping objects were separated using the function “watershed” and finally, cells/particles were counted using the function “analyze particles”. In summary, both 1 ) the number of nuclei per cell and 2 ) the frequency of multinucleated cells relative to total cell numbers were quantified.
To visualize the kinetics and extent of Nipah and Hendra virus-induced cell fusion and cell death in real time, live imaging was performed under maximum containment in the BSL4 laboratory. To quantify cell fusion, GFP + ECs (obtained from the SUN004.1.9 hiPSC line) and wild-type ECs (obtained from the H1 hESC line) were cocultured at a 4:1 ratio, such that fusion between cells of these two genotypes would manifest as diffusion of GFP from one cell to the other.
To this end, frozen stocks of wild-type H1-derived and GFP + SUN004.1.9-derived artery and vein ECs were thawed and cocultured as described above, on Geltrex-coated 8-well chamber slides compatible with microscopy (Ibidi, 80826) in 200 μL of their respective arterial or venous expansion media. After infection with Nipah virus (10 4 TCID 50 units/well), Hendra virus (10 4 TCID 50 units/well) or a negative control (uninfected), live imaging of artery and vein ECs was performed on a spinning disk confocal microscope (CorrSight, FEI) for 24 hours, with a frame rate of 5 minutes, at 37°C, 5% CO 2 , using a 5x objective lens. For these live imaging experiments, a high virus titer was used in order to rapidly induce cytopathic effects to visualize virally-induced cell fusion and death.
Time-lapse videos were imported into Fiji and then analyzed using Mastodon or Trackmate v6.0.2 ( Tinevez et al., 2017 114. Tinevez, J.Y. ∙ Perry, N. ∙ Schindelin, J. ... TrackMate: an open and extensible platform for single-particle tracking Methods. 2017; 115 :80-90 Crossref Scopus (1289) PubMed Google Scholar ). As described above, cocultures of wild-type and GFP + cells were used for live-imaging experiments. GFP + cells were identified as spots or blobs with an estimated blob/spot size of 20 pixels (using the Laplacian of Gaussian [LoG] filter). Then, the 20-pixel spots were filtered based on a quality score above 0.26-0.28. Next, the spots were then linked from frame to frame to build track segments and linking costs of the tracks were calculated (using LAP tracker, based on the Linear Assignment Problem mathematical framework). The parameters for frame-to-frame linking, track segment gap closing, and track segment merging were all set to a maximum distance of 15 pixels. The outputs of this analysis include the median velocity of spots and cell tracks. Cell tracks were exported as .xml files and imported into Icy ( de Chaumont et al., 2012 26. de Chaumont, F. ∙ Dallongeville, S. ∙ Chenouard, N. ... Icy: an open BioImage informatics platform for extended reproducible research Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :690-696 Crossref Scopus (828) PubMed Google Scholar ) to obtain images whereby cell tracks were overlaid over the microscope field. To compare the median velocities of infected artery vs. vein cells, the Mann Whitney non-parametric t-test was performed and two-tailed p-values calculated to determine statistical significance.
hPSC-derived artery and vein ECs were inoculated with Nipah and Hendra viruses for 1 hour and then washed twice in EGM2 to remove excess virus (as described above). After viral inoculation, both the extracellular levels of viral RNA (encompassing viral particles budding into the culture media) and the intracellular levels of viral RNA (encompassing intracellular viral replication) were quantified across different timepoints.
To quantify viral genomes present in the media, 140 μL of the culture media (i.e., supernatant) was placed in 560 μL of lysis buffer AVL (Qiagen QIAamp Viral RNA extraction kit, Qiagen, 52904), in addition to 560 μL of 100% ethanol, in order to inactivate it for transfer out of the BSL4 laboratory. Then, RNA was extracted following the manufacturer’s instructions. To quantify intracellular viral genomes, RNA was first extracted from cellular monolayers as described below (in the section “Bulk-population RNA-seq of virally-infected cells”). Subsequently, qRT-PCR was performed using primers directed against the viral genome and the AgPath-ID TM One-Step RT-PCR Kit (Thermo Fisher, 4387391).
H1 hPSC-derived and SUN004.1.9 hPSC-derived artery and vein ECs in 24-well plates were inoculated with Nipah virus (10 5 TCID 50 units/well), Hendra virus (10 5 TCID 50 units/well) or Sendai virus, Cantell strain (30 HA units/well) or left uninfected (negative control). For RNA-seq experiments, a high viral dose (multiplicity of infection [MOI] ≈ 5) was used in order to synchronize infection in a large proportion of cells. In the same experiment, hPSC-derived artery and vein ECs from two separate genetic backgrounds (H1 hESC-derived and SUN004.1.9 hiPSC-derived) were infected to ensure the consistency of any transcriptional changes that were identified. The timepoints of 5, 10 and 15 hours post-infection were chosen because they encompassed viral entry, viral replication and virus-induced cell fusion prior to extensive cellular destruction at 24 hours post-infection induced by Nipah virus (at the viral dose used in this experiment). For each timepoint, Nipah-, Hendra- or Sendai-infected cells were transcriptionally compared against uninfected cells (negative control) harvested at the same timepoint.
Cells were harvested at 5 hours, 10 hours, and 15 hours post-infection; at each timepoint, cells were lysed in 350 μL of buffer RLT from the RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen, 74004) and then triturated with 350 μL of 70% ethanol to inactivate infectious material for transfer out of the BSL4 laboratory. Then, RNA was extracted as per the manufacturer’s instructions. After quality control procedures, polyadenylated mRNA was enriched using oligo(dT) beads. The mRNA was then fragmented randomly in fragmentation buffer, followed by cDNA synthesis using random hexamers and reverse transcriptase. After first-strand synthesis, a second-strand synthesis buffer (Illumina) was added with dNTPs, RNase H and E. coli polymerase I to generate the second strand by nick-translation. The final cDNA library was then subjected to a round of purification, terminal repair, A-tailing, ligation of sequencing adapters, size selection and PCR enrichment. RNA-seq libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencer by Novogene.
After obtaining RNA-seq reads, quality control was performed using FastQC ( Andrews, 2010 2. Andrews, S. FastQC: A quality control tool for high throughput sequence data http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/ Date: 2010 Google Scholar ) and Trim Galore ( Krueger, 2012 53. Krueger, F. Trim galore https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/ Date: 2012 Google Scholar ) as described above (section “Bulk-population RNA-seq of uninfected cells”). Trimmed and filtered reads from each individual library (which was originally sequenced on multiple lanes) were then merged into a single pooled file for each library.
RNA-seq profiles of virus-infected cells contained both human and viral reads. To analyze human (host cell) transcripts, reads were aligned to the GRCh38 (hg38) Homo sapiens reference genome and gene-level RNA-seq counts were quantified using Kallisto ( Bray et al., 2016 11. Bray, N.L. ∙ Pimentel, H. ∙ Melsted, P. ... Near-optimal probabilistic RNA-seq quantification Nat. Biotechnol. 2016; 34 :525-527 Crossref Scopus (3483) PubMed Google Scholar ). These counts were imported into RStudio and differential gene expression analyses of these counts were performed using DESeq2 ( Love et al., 2014 68. Love, M.I. ∙ Huber, W. ∙ Anders, S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2 Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :550 Crossref Scopus (29293) PubMed Google Scholar ). For all samples, regularized log transformation was performed on the counts to remove the dependence of variance on the mean.
To determine the overall percentage of viral reads within a given RNA-seq sample, Kallisto ( Bray et al., 2016 11. Bray, N.L. ∙ Pimentel, H. ∙ Melsted, P. ... Near-optimal probabilistic RNA-seq quantification Nat. Biotechnol. 2016; 34 :525-527 Crossref Scopus (3483) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used to align reads to the reference genomes of Nipah virus (NCBI accession number GenBank: NC_002728), Hendra virus (NCBI accession number GenBank: NC_001906) or Sendai virus (NCBI accession number GenBank: NC_001552). This enabled the detection of all viral reads within a given sample. Then the number of total viral counts was divided over the number of total human + viral counts to estimate what proportion of the cellular transcriptome comprised viral transcripts.
To quantify the expression of specific viral genes, Kallisto was used to align reads to the following viral genes: • For Nipah virus, reads were aligned to Nipah F (NC_002728.1:6370-8706 nucleotides), Nipah G (NC_002728.1:8710-11255 nucleotides), Nipah L (NC_002728.1:11259-18213 nucleotides), Nipah M (NC_002728.1:5008-6366 nucleotides), Nipah N (NC_002728.1:56-2297 nucleotides) and Nipah P/V/W/C (otherwise known as Nvgp2; NC_002728.1:2301-5004 nucleotides). • For Hendra virus, reads were aligned to Hendra F (NC_001906.3:6346-8676 nucleotides), Hendra G (NC_001906.3:8680-11243 nucleotides), Hendra P/V/W/C (otherwise known as Hvgp2; NC_001906.3:2283-4980 nucleotides), Hendra L (NC_001906.3:11247-18201 nucleotides), Hendra M (NC_001906.3:4984-6342 nucleotides) and Hendra N (NC_001906.3:56-2279 nucleotides). • For Sendai virus, reads were aligned to Sendai F (NC_001552.1:4866-6563 nucleotides), Sendai HN (NC_001552.1:6693-8420 nucleotides), Sendai L (NC_001552.1:8556-15242 nucleotides), Sendai M (NC_001552.1:3669-4715 nucleotides), Sendai NP (NC_001552.1:120-1694 nucleotides) and Sendai P/V/W/C (NC_001552.1:1844-3550 nucleotides).
H1 hPSC-derived, SUN004.1.9 hPSC-derived and SUN004.2 hPSC-derived artery and vein ECs in 48-well plates were inoculated with Nipah virus (5x10 4 TCID 50 units/well), Hendra virus (5x10 4 TCID 50 units/well), Sendai virus (15 HA units/well), or left uninfected (negative control), for 1 hour. For this experiment, a high viral dose (multiplicity of infection [MOI] ≈ 5) was used in order to synchronize infection in a large proportion of cells.
After 1 hour of viral infection, cells were washed twice in EGM2 medium, and then artery and vein cells were cultured in their respective growth media in standard incubator conditions (37°C, 5% CO 2 ). 12 and 24 hours later, supernatants (culture media) were harvested, and stored at -80 °C. Media was then thawed, and the concentration of secreted interferon-β (IFNβ) protein in the undiluted media was quantified using ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), specifically using the Human IFNβ Quantikine QuicKit ELISA Kit (R&D Systems, QK410) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Absorbance was quantified using a TECAN Sunrise plate reader (Tecan Trading AG, Switzerland) with a spectral filter. The concentration of IFNβ in the samples was calculated by comparing the absorbance to that of a standard curve generated with human IFNβ, after subtracting background absorbance, using TECAN Magellan software. Data shown represent the average of results from three separate cell lines (H1, SUN004.1.9 and SUN004.2 hPSCs).
The case fatality rates of both Nipah and Hendra viruses are currently estimated at ∼57-59%, and are referred to as such in this manuscript. • Nipah virus : In a recent review ( Ang et al., 2018 3. Ang, B.S.P. ∙ Lim, T.C.C. ∙ Wang, L. Nipah virus infection J. Clin. Microbiol. 2018; 56 e01875–e01817 Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar ), Nipah virus was recognized to have caused 326 fatalities among 573 human cases in the following regions: Malaysia and Singapore (1998-1999), India and Bangladesh (2001-2012) and the Philippines (2014). Additionally, the World Health Organization has recognized 48 fatalities among 65 new human cases in Bangladesh (2013-2015) and India (2018) ( https://web.archive.org/web/20180613144643/http://www.searo.who.int/entity/emerging_diseases/links/morbidity-and-mortality-nipah-sear-2001-2018.pdf?ua=1 ). Taken together, Nipah virus is currently recognized to have caused 374 fatalities among 638 human cases (∼58.6% case fatality rate). • Hendra virus : Hendra virus is currently recognized to have caused 4 fatalities among 7 human cases in Australia (∼57.1% case fatality rate) ( Mahalingam et al., 2012 70. Mahalingam, S. ∙ Herrero, L.J. ∙ Playford, E.G. ... Hendra virus: an emerging paramyxovirus in Australia Lancet Infect. Dis. 2012; 12 :799-807 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Throughout this study, all error bars represent the standard error of the mean (s.e.m.) and a two-tailed t test was employed to determine statistical significance.
