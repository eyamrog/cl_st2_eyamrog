Title: A selective antibiotic for Lyme disease


Abstract: Summary

Lyme disease is on the rise. Caused by a spirochete Borreliella burgdorferi , it affects an estimated 500,000 people in the United States alone. The antibiotics currently used to treat Lyme disease are broad spectrum, damage the microbiome, and select for resistance in non-target bacteria. We therefore sought to identify a compound acting selectively against B. burgdorferi . A screen of soil micro-organisms revealed a compound highly selective against spirochetes, including B. burgdorferi . Unexpectedly, this compound was determined to be hygromycin A, a known antimicrobial produced by Streptomyces hygroscopicus . Hygromycin A targets the ribosomes and is taken up by B. burgdorferi , explaining its selectivity. Hygromycin A cleared the B. burgdorferi infection in mice, including animals that ingested the compound in a bait, and was less disruptive to the fecal microbiome than clinically relevant antibiotics. This selective antibiotic holds the promise of providing a better therapeutic for Lyme disease and eradicating it in the environment.

Section: Introduction

The incidence and geographic range of Lyme disease caused by Borreliella burgdorferi (formerly Borrelia ) have been increasing due to a variety of factors, including expansion of the habitat range of the tick vector, increasing intersection of human domiciles and animal hosts of ticks, and longer seasonal activity due to climate change ( Steere et al., 2016 70. Steere, A.C. ∙ Strle, F. ∙ Wormser, G.P. ... Lyme borreliosis Nat. Rev. Dis. Primers. 2016; 2 :16090 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Current estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggest that there are almost half a million cases of Lyme disease in the United States per year ( Schwartz et al., 2021 67. Schwartz, A.M. ∙ Kugeler, K.J. ∙ Nelson, C.A. ... Use of commercial claims data for evaluating trends in Lyme disease diagnoses, United States, 2010-2018 Emerg. Infect. Dis. 2021; 27 :499-507 Crossref Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ). The cost of Lyme disease to the US economy has been estimated at approximately $3 billion in direct costs ( Adrion et al., 2015 1. Adrion, E.R. ∙ Aucott, J. ∙ Lemke, K.W. ... Health care costs, utilization and patterns of care following Lyme disease PLoS ONE. 2015; 10 :e0116767 Crossref Scopus (156) PubMed Google Scholar ), with even higher losses due to lost work hours. Acute infection is notable for a characteristic rash called erythema migrans, which starts at the site of inoculation by the tick. From there, the bacteria disseminate quickly to other skin sites, the heart, and the peripheral and central nervous system, causing carditis, radiculitis and nerve palsies, and meningitis. If not treated during the early phase of infection, late symptoms of infection with B. burgdorferi include arthritis and neurological issues.
Related species of Borreliella causing Lyme disease include B. garinii and B. afzelii , which are found predominantly in Eurasia. Although the disease is largely similar between the different Borreliella species, there is an increased incidence of arthritis with B. burgdorferi while B. garinii and B. afzelii are more closely linked to neurologic disease and a skin manifestation called acrodermatitis atrophicans, respectively.
The acute disease is treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, such as doxycycline, amoxicillin, and ceftriaxone. Treatment with broad-spectrum compounds comes at a considerable cost to the patient, disrupting the gut microbiome and selecting for resistance in off-target bacteria ( Modi et al., 2014 50.

The microbiome shapes the immune system during development and contributes to maintaining a healthy gastrointestinal (GI) tract and preventing cardiovascular, mental health, and autoimmune diseases ( Belkaid and Hand, 2014 8.

An antibiotic-impacted microbiota compromises the development of colonic regulatory T cells and predisposes to dysregulated immune responses MBio. 2021; 12 :e03335-20 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ). Development of narrow-spectrum antibiotics is therefore highly desirable. With this in mind, we sought to identify compounds that act selectively against B. burgdorferi .
Most classes of antibiotics currently in use have been discovered from soil actinomycetes ( Lewis, 2020 41. Lewis, K. The science of antibiotic discovery Cell. 2020; 181 :29-45 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (403) PubMed Google Scholar ). These have been heavily overmined, and more recently, novel compounds are coming from other genera ( Imai et al., 2019 35. Imai, Y. ∙ Meyer, K.J. ∙ Iinishi, A. ... A new antibiotic selectively kills Gram-negative pathogens Nature. 2019; 576 :459-464 Crossref Scopus (445) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ling et al., 2015 43. Ling, L.L. ∙ Schneider, T. ∙ Peoples, A.J. ... A new antibiotic kills pathogens without detectable resistance Nature. 2015; 517 :455-459 Crossref Scopus (1813) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, previous searches for active compounds from actinomycetes have focused on broad-spectrum compounds, and narrow-spectrum antibiotics might have been overlooked. We recently reported several novel compounds from actinomycetes acting selectively against Mycobacterium tuberculosis , including lassomycin ( Gavrish et al., 2014 24. Gavrish, E. ∙ Sit, C.S. ∙ Cao, S. ... Lassomycin, a ribosomally synthesized cyclic peptide, kills mycobacterium tuberculosis by targeting the ATP-dependent protease ClpC1P1P2 Chem. Biol. 2014; 21 :509-518 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (316) PubMed Google Scholar ) that targets the unique ClpC1, P1, P2 protease, and amycobactin ( Quigley et al., 2020 60. Quigley, J. ∙ Peoples, A. ∙ Sarybaeva, A. ... Novel antimicrobials from uncultured bacteria acting against Mycobacterium tuberculosis MBio. 2020; 11 :e01516-20 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ) that inhibits SecY of the protein export system.
We reasoned that compounds acting selectively against spirochetes may have evolved in nature and are produced by actinomycetes. A selective screen against B. burgdorferi uncovered hygromycin A, a known compound with poor activity against a variety of bacterial species. Hygromycin A proved to be highly active and selective against spirochetes. The compound acts by binding to a conserved region in the 23S rRNA. We find that hygromycin A is smuggled into B. burgdorferi by a nucleoside transporter, explaining its selectivity. Hygromycin A effectively clears an infection in mice by oral administration and had a minimal effect on the gut microbiome. These properties make hygromycin A an attractive candidate for developing an antibiotic for targeted treatment of Lyme disease.

Section: Results

We developed a selective screen for actinomycete extracts against B. burgdorferi using S. aureus as a counter-screen ( Figure 1 A). This small screen of 452 actinomycetes yielded 24 hits, 6 of which were selective against B. burgdorferi . One of the hits showed potent activity against B. burgdorferi and good selectivity and came from Streptomyces hygroscopicus , a common and well-studied species of Streptomyces . S. hygroscopicus is a prolific producer of secondary metabolites, a surprisingly large number of which are important commercial products. S. hygroscopicus makes rapamycin, an immunosuppressant; milbemycin, a major antihelmintic drug; bialaphos, a widely used herbicide; geldanamycin, an inhibitor of Hsp90, in development as an anti-cancer agent; and antimicrobials hygromycin B, an aminoglycoside antibiotic targeting the ribosome, used in cell culture media; nigericin, an H + /Na + antiporter, growth promoter; and validamycin, an inhibitor of trehalase used to treat fungal pathogens in agriculture.
An extract of S. hygroscopicus was separated into 40 fractions using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The fractions were tested for growth inhibition of B. burgdorferi , resulting in the isolation of a pure compound with a molecular mass of 511 Da ( Figure 1 A). The structure was determined by a combination of mass spectrometry (MS) and NMR analysis ( Figures S1 and S2 ; Tables S1 and S2 ). Surprisingly, a search of AntiBase database revealed the identity of this compound to hygromycin A, a known antibiotic ( Figure 1 A). This was unexpected, given the selectivity of the compound against B. burgdorferi . Hygromycin A was discovered in 1953 by a group from Eli Lilly ( Pittenger et al., 1953 57. Pittenger, R.C. ∙ Wolfe, R.N. ∙ Hoehn, M.M. ... Hygromycin. I. Preliminary studies on the production and biologic activity of a new antibiotic Antibiot. Chemother. (Northfield). 1953; 3 :1268-1278 PubMed Google Scholar ). The compound contains a modified cinnamic acid flanked by a furanose sugar and aminocyclitol (not to be confused with hygromycin B, an unrelated aminoglycoside). Hygromycin A was isolated from S. hygroscopicus , including strains from Selman Waksman’s collection. We examined the spectrum of activity of hygromycin A in detail and found that it is highly active against spirochetes ( Figure 1 B; Table 1 ). The class Spirochaetia consists of 4 defined orders (Brachyspirales, Brevinematales, Leptospirales, and Spirochaetales). Hygromycin A was previously found to be active against Brachyspira hyodysenteriae with a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 1.56 μg/mL (previously called Serpulina hyodysenteriae or Treponema hyodysenteriae ) that belongs to the order Brachyspirales ( Hayashi et al., 1997 31. Hayashi, S.F. ∙ Norcia, L.J. ∙ Seibel, S.B. ... Structure-activity relationships of hygromycin A and its analogs: protein synthesis inhibition activity in a cell free system J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1997; 50 :514-521 Crossref Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ). In our study, we find that hygromycin A has the highest activity against Treponema pallidum , the causative agent of syphilis, with a MIC of 0.03 μg/mL. The compound is equally active against B. burgdorferi and other species responsible for Lyme disease in Eurasia— B. afzelii , B. garinii , and B. bavariensis as well as against Borrelia miyamotoi , a spirochete that causes tick-borne relapsing fever ( Breuner et al., 2018 13. Breuner, N.E. ∙ Hojgaard, A. ∙ Replogle, A.J. ... Transmission of the relapsing fever spirochete, Borrelia miyamotoi , by single transovarially-infected larval Ixodes scapularis ticks Ticks Tick Borne Dis. 2018; 9 :1464-1467 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ), with an MIC of 0.25 μg/mL. It is also active against environmental spirochetes, such as Alkalispirochaeta americana . All these species belong to the order Spirochaetales that displayed higher sensitivity toward hygromycin A in comparison to B. andersonii , L. biflexa , and L. interrogans , species that belong to the orders Brevinematales and Leptospirales, respectively ( Table 1 ). Activity against S. aureus , which was used in the counter-screen, is 32 to 64 times lower as compared to B. burgdorferi . Importantly, the compound is relatively ineffective against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative gut symbionts ( Figure 1 B; Table 1 ). Conveniently, production of hygromycin A by S. hygroscopicus is high, 120 mg/L in the strain KLE3558 isolated from soil. This is probably why the compound was originally discovered, despite its poor activity against non-spirochetes. Hygromycin A is bactericidal against B. burgdorferi , with a minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) of 1 μg/mL (at 4 × MIC). We also tested hygromycin B against B. burgdorferi and, as expected, found it to be fairly inactive, with an MIC of 125 μg/mL.
Selectivity of hygromycin A against spirochetes is puzzling, because it targets the conserved peptidyl transferase center (PTC) of the bacterial ribosome ( Guerrero and Modolell, 1980 29. Guerrero, M.D. ∙ Modolell, J. Hygromycin A, a novel inhibitor of ribosomal peptidyltransferase Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 107 :409-414 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ). To confirm the effect of hygromycin A on protein synthesis, we used a strain of B. burgdorferi that ectopically expresses GFP ( Whetstine et al., 2009 79. Whetstine, C.R. ∙ Slusser, J.G. ∙ Zückert, W.R. Development of a single-plasmid-based regulatable gene expression system for Borrelia burgdorferi Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2009; 75 :6553-6558 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cells were treated with hygromycin A or a known protein synthesis inhibitor (spectinomycin), and GFP production was then induced with anhydrotetracycline. Cells with impaired protein synthesis are expected to remain non-fluorescent. Uninduced cells, non-treated cells, or cells treated with the cell-wall-acting antibiotic amoxicillin served as control. GFP signal was then measured for 100,000 cells by flow cytometry ( Figure 2 A). Cells treated with hygromycin A had a dramatically lower level of GFP as compared to a control, showing that hygromycin A indeed inhibits protein synthesis. The structure of hygromycin A bound to the Thermus thermophilus 70S ribosome shows the interaction of the compound with the conserved 23S rRNA nucleotides that form the core of the peptidyl transferase center ( Polikanov et al., 2015 58. Polikanov, Y.S. ∙ Starosta, A.L. ∙ Juette, M.F. ... Distinct tRNA accommodation intermediates observed on the ribosome with the antibiotics hygromycin A and A201A Mol. Cell. 2015; 58 :832-844 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (65) PubMed Google Scholar ). The identity of these nucleotides is the same in Borreliella , based on our analysis of the genome sequence of B. burgdorferi ( Figures 2 B and 2C). Nevertheless, we initially considered the possibility that hygromycin A could have a much higher affinity to B. burgdorferi ribosomes. We first tested the action of hygromycin A on ribosomes of E. coli . During in vitro translation of the model open reading frames (ORFs), the complete arrest of translation was observed even at the lowest concentration of antibiotic (0.6 μM), which roughly approximates the concentration of active ribosomes in the reaction mixture ( Figure 2 D). Under these conditions, essentially all the ribosomes were captured at the start codons of the ORFs, indicating binding of hygromycin A to the ribosome with a very high affinity (K D < 10 nM). Because it is not possible to improve on a 1:1 binding, this result suggests that the basis for selective action of hygromycin A against spirochetes lies elsewhere. We therefore considered that the transport of hygromycin A into spirochetes might be responsible for its selectivity.
Similar to Gram-negative bacteria, spirochetes have an outer membrane that serves as an additional penetration barrier, which, however, lacks lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and is not as efficient a barrier as that of other species, such as E. coli . In E. coli , LPS on the surface of the outer membrane forms a hydrophilic network that restricts penetration of large or hydrophobic compounds. Substances that leak through the barrier are extruded by trans-envelope multidrug-resistant (MDR) pumps ( Zgurskaya and Nikaido, 2000 84. Zgurskaya, H.I. ∙ Nikaido, H. Multidrug resistance mechanisms: drug efflux across two membranes Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37 :219-225 Crossref Scopus (402) PubMed Google Scholar ). We therefore compared penetration of hygromycin A into B. burgdorferi with that of wild-type and “hyper-porinated” E. coli Δ tolC -Pore. This E. coli strain carries a modified, inducible FhuA siderophore receptor that forms a large pore in the outer membrane ( Krishnamoorthy et al., 2016 40. Krishnamoorthy, G. ∙ Wolloscheck, D. ∙ Weeks, J.W. ... Breaking the permeability barrier of Escherichia coli by controlled hyperporination of the outer membrane Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2016; 60 :7372-7381 Crossref Scopus (100) PubMed Google Scholar ). As a result, the outer membrane is structurally intact but has lost its barrier function. E. coli Δ tolC -Pore also carries a deletion in TolC, which encodes a channel serving as an exit portal for MDR substrates, further increasing the permeability of this strain.
To measure penetration of hygromycin A, B. burgdorferi and E. coli cells were incubated with the antibiotic; samples were withdrawn, rapidly filtered, and lysed; and intracellular concentration of the compound was determined by MS analysis of material separated by liquid chromatography (LC/MS) ( Figure S3 ). There was little penetration of the compound into E. coli ( Figure 3 A). Importantly, there was no difference in MIC between cells with an intact outer membrane and those expressing the FhuA pore, suggesting that active efflux pumps and the inner membrane of E. coli are the barriers for hygromycin A ( Table S3 ; Figure S4 A). In agreement with this, efflux-deficient E. coli Δ tolC cells accumulate higher levels of hygromycin A ( Figure 3 C, middle panel). By contrast, accumulation of hygromycin A into cells of B. burgdorferi was rapid and substantial (note that the relatively high levels of antibiotic in this experiment were used because a dense culture of cells is required to measure the level of intracellular compound). No significant difference in the levels of accumulated hygromycin A could be seen after a short 1-min incubation and a long incubation for 40 min. Apparently, hygromycin A is smuggled into B. burgdorferi by a transporter that is unique to spirochetes and is responsible for the selectivity of the compound against this group of micro-organisms.
In order to identify a possible transporter, we selected for mutants resistant to hygromycin A. To do so, we first used a standard approach to obtain resistant mutants by embedding a large number of cells (10 8 –10 9 ) in semi-solid Barbour-Stoenner-Kelly (BSK) medium containing various concentrations of hygromycin A. Colonies growing on hygromycin-A-containing plates were then picked, grown in liquid medium without antibiotic, and plated again on medium with a higher concentration of compound. We also used an evolutionary selection by serial passaging in increasing concentrations of hygromycin A in liquid cultures. For both approaches, we used B. burgdorferi B31 wild type, a B. burgdorferi hyper-mutator strain with a deletion in mutS , a fast-growing Borrelia species ( B. turcica ), a pooled transposon mutant library of B. burgdorferi , and ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS)-mutagenized B. burgdorferi . For the evolutionary approach, cultures growing at the highest hygromycin A concentration were reinoculated in liquid medium without antibiotic and then challenged with higher concentrations of the compound. This approach, however, produced slow-growing cells. It is known that frequent passaging of B. burgdorferi under laboratory conditions leads to plasmid loss ( Grimm et al., 2003 27. Grimm, D. ∙ Elias, A.F. ∙ Tilly, K. ... Plasmid stability during in vitro propagation of Borrelia burgdorferi assessed at a clonal level Infect. Immun. 2003; 71 :3138-3145 Crossref Scopus (66) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, most resistant isolates were unstable and lost resistance after growth in the absence of hygromycin A. Combined, this very large effort yielded only two mutants: B. turcica KLEX1 and B. burgdorferi B31 KLEX2 with stable hygromycin A resistance, MICs of 8 μg/mL and 4 μg/mL, respectively, which is a 16-fold increase as compared to their wild-type parent strains. The two hygromycin-A-resistant mutants did not have any growth defect. The genomes of the mutants were sequenced and the mutations were analyzed. KLEX1 and KLEX2 isolates carried the same two mutations in the gene coding for the 23S rRNA, the known target of hygromycin A (2629G > T and 2618G > T; B. turcica and B. burgdorferi nucleotide numbering, respectively; Tables S4 and S5 ). B. burgdorferi has two copies of 23S rRNA ( Schwartz et al., 1992 66. Schwartz, J.J. ∙ Gazumyan, A. ∙ Schwartz, I. rRNA gene organization in the Lyme disease spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174 :3757-3765 Crossref Scopus (140) PubMed Google Scholar ), equivalent to two targets, which will diminish the probability of resistance development ( Silver, 2007 69. Silver, L.L. Multi-targeting by monotherapeutic antibacterials Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2007; 6 :41-55 Crossref Scopus (263) PubMed Google Scholar ). Given that the conserved target is not responsible for the selectivity of hygromycin A, we considered that additional mutations in the resistant strains might lead to a decrease in the transport of the compound. Measuring hygromycin A penetration showed that uptake of the compound was severely impaired in the B. burgdorferi KLEX2 mutant ( Figure 3 C, upper panel), but not in the B. turcica KLEX1 mutant ( Figure S4 B).
The B. burgdorferi KLEX2 mutant accumulated a total of 21 polymorphisms, but no non-synonymous mutations were found in genes known to be involved in transport ( Table S5 ). Only one of the genes (BB 0336) contained a frameshift mutation adjacent to an operon involved in oligopeptide transport (OppABCDF). If hygromycin A was using the oligopeptide transporter for uptake, then a mutation in BB0336 could lead to downregulation of OppABCDF expression and antibiotic resistance. However, hygromycin A susceptibility was not changed in a B. burgdorferi strain with a knockout in oppDF . This shows that the oligopeptide transport system of B. burgdorferi is not involved in hygromycin A uptake. We next considered that one or more of the 21 SNPs in the KLEX2 mutant might lead to downregulation of expression of a hygromycin A transporter. Such downregulation could then be detected by transcriptome analysis. By comparing the transcriptome of wild-type B. burgdorferi with KLEX2, we observed the absence of reads for many transcripts in the resistant mutant, which is unsurprising, because B. burgdorferi tends to lose plasmids when serially passaged in the lab. We then compared the transcriptome of KLEX2 treated with hygromycin A at 1× MIC to that of untreated cells ( Table S6 ). Notably, the transcriptome of hygromycin-A-treated cells showed a 3.18-fold decrease in the expression of bmpD , a periplasmic substrate-binding protein of an ABC-type purine nucleoside transporter composed of two transmembrane proteins (BB0678 and BB0679) and the ATP-binding protein BB0677 (subsequently referred to as BmpDEFG; Åstrand et al., 2019 2. Åstrand, M. ∙ Cuellar, J. ∙ Hytönen, J. ... Predicting the ligand-binding properties of Borrelia burgdorferi s.s. Bmp proteins in light of the conserved features of related Borrelia proteins J. Theor. Biol. 2019; 462 :97-108 Crossref Scopus (5) PubMed Google Scholar ; Cuellar et al., 2020 19. Cuellar, J. ∙ Åstrand, M. ∙ Elovaara, H. ... Structural and biomolecular analyses of Borrelia burgdorferi BmpD reveal a substrate-binding protein of an ABC-type nucleoside transporter family Infect. Immun. 2020; 88 :e00962-19 Crossref Scopus (7) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 3 B). B. burgdorferi lacks enzymes required for de novo purine synthesis, and BmpDEFG is essential for nucleoside uptake. No other genes involved in transport were significantly differentially regulated.
Because a decrease in expression of BmpD correlated with resistance to hygromycin A, we expected that overexpressing this protein will produce an opposite effect, increasing susceptibility to the antibiotic. We cloned bmpD under the control of an IPTG-inducible promoter using the B. burgdorferi expression vector pJSB275m ( Blevins et al., 2007 9. Blevins, J.S. ∙ Revel, A.T. ∙ Smith, A.H. ... Adaptation of a luciferase gene reporter and lac expression system to Borrelia burgdorferi Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2007; 73 :1501-1513 Crossref Scopus (69) PubMed Google Scholar ) and assessed the MIC of this overexpression strain. Overexpression of bmpD in B. burgdorferi resulted in a 4-fold reduction in hygromycin A MIC ( Figure 3 D, upper panel), while the MIC for ceftriaxone remained unchanged. This effect was IPTG independent, likely due to the leakiness of the promoter in the construct. Overexpression of BmpD had no effect on the MIC of ceftriaxone, a cell-wall-acting antibiotic. We then examined the ability of BmpD to affect hygromycin A resistance in a heterologous system, using E. coli as a host. To this end, bmpD was cloned into the pBAD30 expression vector under an arabinose promoter and transformed into E. coli Δ tolC (carrying a deletion in the TolC component of MDR pumps to avoid effects from efflux of hygromycin A). Inducing expression of BmpD resulted in an 8-fold reduction of E. coli hygromycin A MIC ( Figure 3 D, middle panel), in good agreement with a similar result obtained with B. burgdorferi . Next, we measured penetration of hygromycin A into E. coli carrying recombinant BmpD. Expression of the protein increased penetration of hygromycin A ( Figure 3 C, lower panel), suggesting that nucleoside transporters contribute to the uptake of hygromycin A. E. coli nucleoside transporters NupC, NupG, and YegT are induced by adenosine ( Xie et al., 2004 82. Xie, H. ∙ Patching, S.G. ∙ Gallagher, M.P. ... Purification and properties of the Escherichia coli nucleoside transporter NupG, a paradigm for a major facilitator transporter sub-family Mol. Membr. Biol. 2004; 21 :323-336 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ). Addition of adenosine to E. coli resulted in a concentration-dependent decrease in MIC up to 8-fold ( Figure 3 D, lower panel). When bmpD was induced, addition of adenosine did not result in a further decrease of MIC, suggesting that either the uptake of hygromycin A, the target engagement, or both are saturated under these conditions.
Given the high potency and selectivity of hygromycin A against Borreliella , we sought to determine its potential as a therapeutic. Testing hygromycin A against a number of human cell lines showed no cytotoxicity (EC 50 > 512), giving an impressive in vitro therapeutic index of >2,000 ( Table S7 ). Next, we tested hygromycin A in a mouse model of acute Lyme disease ( Hodzic et al., 2003 32. Hodzic, E. ∙ Feng, S. ∙ Freet, K.J. ... Borrelia burgdorferi population dynamics and prototype gene expression during infection of immunocompetent and immunodeficient mice Infect. Immun. 2003; 71 :5042-5055 Crossref Scopus (106) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mice are infected with B. burgdorferi N40 by subcutaneous injection, after which the pathogen propagates and spreads from the site of injection. 3 weeks after inoculation, hygromycin A was delivered by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection as an aqueous solution. Therapy in the mouse model aims to emulate treatment of humans, and antibiotics are administered twice a day for 5 days. In this model, the pathogen burden is determined by culturing skin samples in a liquid medium and performing quantitative PCR of the pathogen 16S rRNA ( Ornstein and Barbour, 2006 56. Ornstein, K. ∙ Barbour, A.G. A reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay of Borrelia burgdorferi 16S rRNA for highly sensitive quantification of pathogen load in a vector Vector Borne Zoonotic Dis. 2006; 6 :103-112 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ). Culturing in liquid is a stringent test of efficacy, because even one surviving cell of the pathogen will result in growth. After 5 days of treatment, hygromycin A cleared the infection, similarly to the ceftriaxone control ( Table 2 ).
We also tested oral administration of hygromycin A and found similar efficacy. There were no indications of toxicity, even at very high doses, suggesting the compound is safe.
Broad-spectrum antibiotics can disrupt the gut microbiome ( Ferrer et al., 2017 23. Ferrer, M. ∙ Méndez-García, C. ∙ Rojo, D. ... Antibiotic use and microbiome function Biochem. Pharmacol. 2017; 134 :114-126 Crossref Scopus (226) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because hygromycin A is selective against spirochetes and is inactive against many intestinal bacterial isolates ( Table 1 ), we examined microbiome changes that accompany treatment of C3H mice with this compound. Mice were infected with B. burgdorferi N40 and treated with clinically relevant doses of hygromycin A, ceftriaxone, or amoxicillin, and the microbiome composition was analyzed by sequencing 16S rDNA. Ampicillin and amoxicillin caused significant changes in the composition of the microbiota ( Figures 4 C, 4D, and S5 ). Notably, there was a prominent bloom of pathogenic Enterococcus , resulting in 98% of total microbiome abundance in some of the animals. Amoxicillin also produced a bloom of Bacteroides in some of the mice, apparently due to the presence of resistant bacteria. By contrast, the changes produced by hygromycin A were milder, with a prominent increase in symbiotic Lactobacillus and Lactococcus . Given the low activity of hygromycin A against gut bacteria, the reason for this observed shift is presently unknown.
Good efficacy, safety, oral availability, and selectivity of hygromycin A open an additional intriguing possibility of eradicating Lyme disease by targeting its environmental reservoir. In a previously published study, a bait containing doxycycline was spread in a limited area and cleared the infection in 87% of mice and 94% of Ixodes ticks ( Dolan et al., 2011 20. Dolan, M.C. ∙ Schulze, T.L. ∙ Jordan, R.A. ... Elimination of Borrelia burgdorferi and Anaplasma phagocytophilum in rodent reservoirs and Ixodes scapularis ticks using a doxycycline hyclate-laden bait Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 2011; 85 :1114-1120 Crossref Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ). This is far above levels required to reduce infection below the transmission threshold—the percentage of infected ticks and mice needed to sustain the infectious cycle in the wild ( Lou et al., 2014 45. Lou, Y. ∙ Wu, J. ∙ Wu, X. Impact of biodiversity and seasonality on Lyme-pathogen transmission Theor. Biol. Med. Model. 2014; 11 :50 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ; Mount et al., 1997 52. Mount, G.A. ∙ Haile, D.G. ∙ Daniels, E. Simulation of management strategies for the blacklegged tick (Acari: Ixodidae) and the Lyme disease spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi J. Med. Entomol. 1997; 34 :672-683 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ). Doxycycline, however, is an essential part of our shrinking antibiotic arsenal, and spreading it on large territory is unfeasible due to the risk of selecting for resistant micro-organisms. Hygromycin A, with its limited activity against non-spirochetal organisms, would make an ideal reservoir-targeted antibiotic against B. burgdorferi . We therefore tested the efficacy of hygromycin A to clear B. burgdorferi by incorporating it into mouse baits. Consuming baits with hygromycin A efficiently cleared B. burgdorferi infection in the animals ( Figures 4 A and 4B).

Section: Discussion

The rise in antibiotic resistance and the important role the microbiome plays in human health suggest a transition from traditional broad-spectrum to selectively acting compounds. Here, we report the rediscovery of hygromycin A as a selective and efficient antibiotic acting against B. burgdorferi , the causative agent of Lyme disease. We identified hygromycin A in a differential screen of soil actinomycetes against B. burgdorferi , counter-screening against S. aureus . Produced by S. hygroscopicus , hygromycin A is an old, abandoned antibiotic, with poor activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The one exception has been Brachyspira (formerly Treponema; Omura et al., 1987 54. Omura, S. ∙ Nakagawa, A. ∙ Fujimoto, T. ... Hygromycin A, an antitreponemal substance. I. Screening method and therapeutic effect for Treponema hyodysenteriae -caused infection in CF-1 mice J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1987; 40 :1619-1626 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ), and for a while, hygromycin A was evaluated as a potential treatment for pig dysentery caused by this pathogen. Although efficacy was established, apparently, the economics of this application were not favorable due to low activity against other pathogens, and the compound was largely forgotten. Testing a variety of bacteria showed that hygromycin A is highly potent against spirochetes, with MIC around 0.2 μg/mL. Apparently, hygromycin A evolved in actinomycetes as a weapon against environmental spirochetes.
Given the poor activity of hygromycin A against most bacteria, we examined its effect on the mouse microbiome. By comparison to conventional broad-spectrum antibiotics used to treat Lyme disease, changes following hygromycin A administration were mild ( Figures 4 C and 4D). A particularly troublesome consequence of therapy with broad-spectrum antibiotics is a dramatic expansion of drug-resistant mutants of opportunistic pathogens, such as Enterococci that take over the population. This both harms the microbiome and contributes to the spread of drug resistance. Such expansion was not observed with hygromycin A.
The mechanism of selectivity of hygromycin A is puzzling because the compound inhibits protein synthesis by binding to the ribosomal 23S rRNA in the catalytic peptidyl transferase center. This functional part of the ribosome is highly conserved among bacteria, including B. burgdorferi . If action against the target cannot be responsible for the observed selectivity, the remaining logical possibility is transport. Tracking penetration by LC/MS showed rapid accumulation of hygromycin A into B. burgdorferi , but not E. coli . Transcriptome analysis of a resistant mutant showed a downregulation of BmpD, the periplasmic substrate-binding protein of an ABC-type transporter (BmpDEFG) of purine nucleosides. Ectopic overexpression of BmpD had the opposite effect, increasing susceptibility to hygromycin A. BmpD is conserved in the Borreliella and Borrelia genera, and T. pallidum has a PnrA nucleoside transporter homologous to BmpD ( Åstrand et al., 2019 2. Åstrand, M. ∙ Cuellar, J. ∙ Hytönen, J. ... Predicting the ligand-binding properties of Borrelia burgdorferi s.s. Bmp proteins in light of the conserved features of related Borrelia proteins J. Theor. Biol. 2019; 462 :97-108 Crossref Scopus (5) PubMed Google Scholar ; Cuellar et al., 2020 19. Cuellar, J. ∙ Åstrand, M. ∙ Elovaara, H. ... Structural and biomolecular analyses of Borrelia burgdorferi BmpD reveal a substrate-binding protein of an ABC-type nucleoside transporter family Infect. Immun. 2020; 88 :e00962-19 Crossref Scopus (7) PubMed Google Scholar ), explaining selectivity of hygromycin A. In B. burgdorferi , BmpDEFG is likely essential, because the spirochetes are auxotrophic for purines and this is the only transporter that brings them into the cell ( Cuellar et al., 2020 19. Cuellar, J. ∙ Åstrand, M. ∙ Elovaara, H. ... Structural and biomolecular analyses of Borrelia burgdorferi BmpD reveal a substrate-binding protein of an ABC-type nucleoside transporter family Infect. Immun. 2020; 88 :e00962-19 Crossref Scopus (7) PubMed Google Scholar ). This is why we did not observe selection for high-frequency null mutants in BmpDEFG conferring resistance to hygromycin A.
Compounds acting against selective bacterial groups are well documented, and it appears that their number reflects the effort expended to identify them, rather than their incidence in nature. A considerable effort to find antibiotics acting against M. tuberculosis resulted in the discovery of cyclomarin, lassomycin, and kitamycobactin targeting the essential mycobacterial protease ClpP1P2C1 ( Gavrish et al., 2014 24. Gavrish, E. ∙ Sit, C.S. ∙ Cao, S. ... Lassomycin, a ribosomally synthesized cyclic peptide, kills mycobacterium tuberculosis by targeting the ATP-dependent protease ClpC1P1P2 Chem.

Novel antimicrobials from uncultured bacteria acting against Mycobacterium tuberculosis MBio. 2020; 11 :e01516-20 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ; Schmitt et al., 2011 65. Schmitt, E.K. ∙ Riwanto, M. ∙ Sambandamurthy, V. ... The natural product cyclomarin kills Mycobacterium tuberculosis by targeting the ClpC1 subunit of the caseinolytic protease Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2011; 50 :5889-5891 Crossref Scopus (155) PubMed Google Scholar ); griselimycin, targeting DNA polymerase ( Kling et al., 2015 39. Kling, A. ∙ Lukat, P. ∙ Almeida, D.V. ... Antibiotics. Targeting DnaN for tuberculosis therapy using novel griselimycins Science. 2015; 348 :1106-1112 Crossref Scopus (246) PubMed Google Scholar ); amycobactin, targeting the SecY protein export component of mycobacteria ( Quigley et al., 2020 60. Quigley, J. ∙ Peoples, A. ∙ Sarybaeva, A. ... Novel antimicrobials from uncultured bacteria acting against Mycobacterium tuberculosis MBio. 2020; 11 :e01516-20 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ); and others. A screen against Pseudomonas aeruginosa led to the discovery of pacidamycins that target MraY, a conserved essential enzyme of the peptidoglycan biosynthetic pathway. Pacidamycins appeared to be selectively taken up by an oligopeptide transporter of P. aeruginosa ( Mistry et al., 2013 49. Mistry, A. ∙ Warren, M.S. ∙ Cusick, J.K. ... High-level pacidamycin resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa is mediated by an opp oligopeptide permease encoded by the opp-fabI operon Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2013; 57 :5565-5571 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ). This is similar to hygromycin uptake; however, the pseudomonas transporter is non-essential and resistant mutants appear with high frequency. In a majority of known cases, selectivity is determined by the target. Selectivity determined by an essential transporter we report in this study significantly increases the repertoire of possible underlying mechanisms and, with it, increases the possibility of identifying additional compounds targeting a narrow taxonomic group of pathogens. We may expect a growing number of such selective antibiotics focused on pathogens and sparing the microbiome.
Hygromycin A has a number of features that makes it an attractive candidate for treating Lyme disease. Apart from sparing the microbiome, resistance development is very low and only occurs upon multiple passages. There is no detectable cytotoxicity against human cells, and we were unable to detect toxicity upon oral administration, even at very high doses, exceeding MIC 2,500-fold. This is probably a consequence of poor penetration through membranes of this highly water-soluble compound (LogP −0.66) that requires a transporter to smuggle it to its target in spirochetes. By the same token, hygromycin A is unlikely to reach a homologous 23S rRNA in mitochondrial ribosomes. Hygromycin A was able to clear a B. burgdorferi infection in mice upon oral administration. Oral availability is a desirable property for an antibiotic, especially for compounds that need to be administered over lengthy periods of time. Acute Lyme disease is usually treated with a 2-week ( Stupica et al., 2012 74. Stupica, D. ∙ Lusa, L. ∙ Ruzić-Sabljić, E. ... Treatment of erythema migrans with doxycycline for 10 days versus 15 days Clin. Infect. Dis. 2012; 55 :343-350 Crossref Scopus (71) PubMed Google Scholar ) course of doxycycline, which is not particularly short, but Lyme arthritis that develops if the infection is not diagnosed in time requires up to 3 months of antibiotic therapy. Apart from treating acute infection, antibiotics are also given prophylactically in case of a tick bite to prevent possible infection. Such prophylaxis may become more routine if it involves an antibiotic acting selectively against the pathogen with fewer side effects.
We find that hygromycin A is also highly potent against another important human pathogen, T. pallidum , the spirochete causing syphilis. T. pallidum is becoming increasingly resistant to current therapies ( Tien et al., 2020 75. Tien, V. ∙ Punjabi, C. ∙ Holubar, M.K. Antimicrobial resistance in sexually transmitted infections J. Travel Med. 2020; 27 :taz101 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ), and hygromycin A may be a candidate for treating this sexually transmitted disease.
Acute Lyme infection, even if treated in time, produces a poorly understood post-Lyme disease in about 10%–20% of patients ( Aucott, 2015 3. Aucott, J.N. Posttreatment Lyme disease syndrome Infect. Dis. Clin. North Am. 2015; 29 :309-323 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ; Aucott et al., 2013 5. Aucott, J.N. ∙ Crowder, L.A. ∙ Kortte, K.B.

(Lausanne). 2017; 4 :224 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar ). This condition is characterized by fatigue, muscle pain, a “foggy” mind, and other symptoms. The significance of this debilitating disease has been recently brought into focus by a set of very similar symptoms in patients with “long coronavirus disease (COVID)” ( Aucott and Rebman, 2021 4. Aucott, J.N. ∙ Rebman, A.W. Long-haul COVID: heed the lessons from other infection-triggered illnesses Lancet. 2021; 397 :967-968 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ). There are a number of objective markers that are associated with post-Lyme disease, such as elevated microglial activation ( Coughlin et al., 2018 17. Coughlin, J.M. ∙ Yang, T. ∙ Rebman, A.W. ... Imaging glial activation in patients with post-treatment Lyme disease symptoms: a pilot study using [ 11 C]DPA-713 PET J. Neuroinflammation. 2018; 15 :346 Crossref Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ), a decrease of the CD57 lymphocyte subset ( Stricker et al., 2002 72. Stricker, R.B. ∙ Burrascano, J. ∙ Winger, E. Longterm decrease in the CD57 lymphocyte subset in a patient with chronic Lyme disease Ann. Agric. Environ. Med. 2002; 9 :111-113 PubMed Google Scholar ; Stricker and Winger, 2001 71. Stricker, R.B. ∙ Winger, E.E. Decreased CD57 lymphocyte subset in patients with chronic Lyme disease Immunol. Lett. 2001; 76 :43-48 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ), increased levels of the chemokine CCL19 ( Aucott et al., 2016 6. Aucott, J.N. ∙ Soloski, M.J. ∙ Rebman, A.W. ... CCL19 as a chemokine risk factor for posttreatment Lyme disease syndrome: a prospective clinical cohort study Clin. Vaccine Immunol. 2016; 23 :757-766 Crossref Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the cytokine interleukin-23 (IL-23) ( Strle et al., 2014 73. Strle, K. ∙ Stupica, D. ∙ Drouin, E.E. ... Elevated levels of IL-23 in a subset of patients with post-lyme disease symptoms following erythema migrans Clin. Infect. Dis. 2014; 58 :372-380 Crossref Scopus (84) PubMed Google Scholar ), and, interestingly, a characteristic shift in the microbiome composition ( Morrissette et al., 2020 51. Morrissette, M. ∙ Pitt, N. ∙ González, A. ... A distinct microbiome signature in posttreatment Lyme disease patients MBio. 2020; 11 :e02310-20 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ). Whether this change in the microbiome of post-Lyme patients contributes to the disease is unclear, but having therapeutics that avoid harming the microbiome may be particularly desirable in the case of Lyme disease.
Lyme disease is on the rise and, in many locations, limits our ability to enjoy outdoor activities. Although vaccination can protect those that receive the vaccine, it does not get to the heart of the problem and requires continued health care expenditures. A more permanent solution would require eradicating the source of the disease. We show that baits containing hygromycin A clear B. burgdorferi infection in mice, the principal host of the pathogen. This opens the attractive possibility of environmental eradication of this troublesome pathogen.
The aim of this study was to identify a compound that acts selectively against B. burgdorferi and can be developed into a dedicated therapeutic to treat Lyme disease. A differential screen of soil isolates led to the identification of hygromycin A that selectively kills spirochetes. We then examined the mechanism of selectivity and the potential of hygromycin A as a therapeutic. Hygromycin A is known to bind to the conserved ribosomal 23S rRNA, and we therefore searched for an alternative explanation for its selective action—a possible transporter unique to spirochetes that could smuggle the compound into the cell. Transcriptome analysis showed that, in the presence of hygromycin, expression of BmpD, a periplasmic binding protein of the spirochete nucleoside transporter, is downregulated. Subsequent experiments indicated that the BmpD transport system is involved in bringing the compound into the cell, explaining the nature of selectivity. At present, we do not know how hygromycin causes a decrease in the expression of BmpD. We also assume that the BmpD transport system is essential, based on indirect evidence, such as the auxotrophy of spirochetes for nucleosides and the lack of transposon insertions in this locus. This would explain why we failed to obtain high-frequency null mutants in BmpD resistant to hygromycin A. However, direct evidence for the essentiality of BmpD to spirochetes is lacking. Regarding the therapeutic potential of hygromycin A, we show that the compound is efficacious in a mouse model of Lyme disease by both parenteral and oral administration, and there were no signs of toxicity at fairly high doses. The compound also shows no cytotoxicity. This indicates that the compound may be safe and efficacious. At the same time, these are only the first steps in the preclinical evaluation of a compound, which will require a detailed pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic, metabolism and toxicology evaluation before it enters into clinical trials. The preclinical work will show whether hygromycin A, as most natural product antibiotics that became drugs, can be developed in its native form or will require medicinal chemistry optimization to improve its properties.

Actinomycete strains were isolated as follows: soil was collected, mixed with calcium carbonate and enriched for spores by dry heat at 70°C for 30 minutes. Cells were then serially diluted ten-fold and plated on oatmeal agar medium. After 7 days of incubation, plates were examined under a dissecting microscope and colonies with characteristic Actinomycete morphology were re-streaked to fresh plates. After 7 days of incubation, biomass was scraped and re-suspended in TSB with 15% glycerol. Stocks were stored at −80°C. Several Actinomycete strains were purchased from the ARS Culture Collection (NRRL).

Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum Nichols, initially isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid of a neurosyphilis patient in Baltimore, Maryland, U.S.A. in 1912, was a gift to SJN from J. N. Miller at the UCLA Geffen School of Medicine. In vitro cultivation of T. pallidum has been described in detail by Edmondson et al. (2018) 21. Edmondson, D.G. ∙ Hu, B. ∙ Norris, S.J. Long-term in vitro culture of the syphilis spirochete Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum MBio. 2018; 9 :e01153-18 Crossref Scopus (150) PubMed Google Scholar . Briefly, T. pallidum is grown in co-culture with rabbit epithelial cells (Sf1Ep (NBL-11),(ATCC CCL-68TM)). Stocks of Sf1EP cells were between passage 36 and 40 and were maintained in Sf1Ep medium consisting of Eagle’s MEM with non-essential amino acids, L-glutamine, sodium pyruvate, and 10% heat-inactivated FBS (48) at 37°C in air with 5% CO 2 . One day prior to initiation of antibiotic testing, Sf1Ep cells were seeded into tissue culture-treated 6-well cluster plates at 0.5x10 5 per well. T. pallidum cultivation medium (TpCM-2) was prepared the day before experiment initiation and pre-equilibrated in a BBL GasPak jar in which a vacuum was drawn five times (house vacuum, ∼12-18 um Hg). The jar was refilled with 5% CO 2 :95% N 2 four times and a final time with 1.5% O 2 :5% CO 2 :93.5% N 2 . The medium was then incubated overnight in a tri-gas incubator (ThermoFisher Forma Model 3130) maintained at 34°C and 1.5% O 2 :5% CO 2 :93.5% N 2 (hereafter referred to as the low oxygen incubator). All subsequent steps in the incubation of T. pallidum cultures were carried out under these conditions.
E. coli WO153 was kindly provided by Lucy Ling, Novobiotic Pharmaceuticals ( Ling et al., 2015 43. Ling, L.L. ∙ Schneider, T. ∙ Peoples, A.J. ... A new antibiotic kills pathogens without detectable resistance Nature. 2015; 517 :455-459 Crossref Scopus (1813) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Shigella sonnei (ATCC 25931), Salmonella enterica Typhimurium LT2 (ATCC 19585), Enterobacter cloacae (ATCC 13047), Bifidobacterium longum (ATCC BAA-999), Lactobacillus reuteri (ATCC 23272), Blautia producta (ATCC 27340) and Bacteroides fragilis (ATCC 25285) strains were purchased from ATCC. Bacteria from laboratory KLE collection were isolated as described previously ( Imai et al., 2019 35. Imai, Y. ∙ Meyer, K.J. ∙ Iinishi, A. ... A new antibiotic selectively kills Gram-negative pathogens Nature. 2019; 576 :459-464 Crossref Scopus (445) PubMed Google Scholar ). S. aureus HG003, E. coli W0153, E. coli MG1655 and P. aeruginosa PO1 were grown aerobically in cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton broth (MHIIB), all other bacteria and members of the gut flora were grown in an anaerobic chamber (5% H 2 , 10% CO 2 , and 85% N 2 ) in Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) broth, supplemented with 0.5% Yeast Extract, 50mM MOPS buffer, 0.1% cysteine hydrochloride and 15 μg/ml hemin (BHI-YMCH).
The cell lines used were FaDu pharynx squamous cell carcinoma (ATCC HTB-43), HepG2 liver hepatocellular carcinoma (ATCC HB-8065), and HEK293-RFP human embryonic kidney red fluorescent protein tagged (GenTarget SC007) cells. All cells were cultured in Eagle’s Minimum Essential Medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37°C.
Wild-type 6 weeks old female C3H mice (Charles River Laboratories) were used for all animal experiments. All animal experiments were conducted according to protocols that were approved by the Institute of Animal Care and Usage Committee (IACUC) at Northeastern University (Approval #16 −0619R). Mice were randomly assigned to experimental groups.
The microbroth dilution Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) method was used to quantitatively measure the in vitro antibacterial activity of hygromycin A against bacterial strains.
Anti- Borreliella MIC assays were performed as described previously ( Wu et al., 2018 81. Wu, X. ∙ Sharma, B. ∙ Niles, S. ... Identifying vancomycin as an effective antibiotic for killing Borrelia burgdorferi Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2018; 62 :e01201-18 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, cultures were grown to stationary phase and diluted 1:10 (1:100 for L. biflexa ) in a 96-well plate containing Hygromycin A diluted serially 2 fold. Plates with Borrelia cultures were incubated in a microaerophilic chamber (Coy hypoxic O 2 control glove box) for 7 days (34°C, 3% O 2 , 5% CO 2 ) and scored visually for a pink to yellow color change of the phenol red present in the medium. Plates with A. americana and Leptospira cultures were grown for 4 days under anaerobic conditions and 6 days under aerobic conditions respectively, and scored visually for change in color imparted by resazurin (0.001 g/L) present in the medium. The lowest concentration of antibiotic that prevented color change was interpreted as the MIC. The samples were also observed by dark field microscopy to count the number of spirochetes and results corroborated the visual MIC score.
Three hours prior to the start of a T. pallidum MIC experiment, the medium in the 6-well plates containing Sf1EP cells was removed, and the plates were rinsed with the pre-equilibrated TpCM-2 to remove traces of Sf1Ep medium and the medium replaced with 4 mL of the TpCM-2. The antibiotic to be tested was then added to each well to obtain the indicated antibiotic concentrations. Plates were then pre-equilibrated in the GasPak jar as described above and then transferred to the low oxygen incubator. Antibiotic sensitivity testing was initiated by inoculation of cultures with 3.3-3.5 × 10 6 T. pallidum trypsinized from an actively growing culture. Sf1Ep cultures containing antibiotics were briefly removed from the incubator, inoculated with T. pallidum , pre-equilibrated, and then returned to the low oxygen incubator. Three biological replicates were used for each antibiotic concentration. Following seven days of culture the T. pallidum were trypsinized to remove them from the Sf1Ep cells ( Edmondson et al., 2018 21. Edmondson, D.G. ∙ Hu, B. ∙ Norris, S.J. Long-term in vitro culture of the syphilis spirochete Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum MBio. 2018; 9 :e01153-18 Crossref Scopus (150) PubMed Google Scholar ) and quantitated by darkfield microscopy using Helber counting chambers with Thoma rulings (Hawksley, Lancing, Sussex, UK). Each culture was counted at least twice using this method. Motility of each organism was also assessed. The MIC was calculated by interpolating the yields relative to the inoculum, with the point at which the yield = inoculum representing the MIC. Hygromycin A spectrum of activity against a panel of lab strains, pathobionts and symbionts was determined as described previously ( Imai et al., 2019 35. Imai, Y. ∙ Meyer, K.J. ∙ Iinishi, A. ... A new antibiotic selectively kills Gram-negative pathogens Nature. 2019; 576 :459-464 Crossref Scopus (445) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, aerobic lab strains (i.e., S. aureus HG003, E. coli W0153 and MG1655, P. aeruginosa PAO1) from liquid cultures were diluted into the assay plate to achieve 5 × 10 5 CFU/mL; pathobionts and symbionts from anaerobic cultures were diluted 100 fold. Assay plates were prepared by 2-fold dilution of compound across the plate and included a positive growth control. After incubating the aerobes at 37°C for 16-20 hours and the anaerobes in an anaerobic chamber for 24-48 hours, the MIC was determined as the lowest concentration of compound that inhibits growth of the bacteria as detected by the unaided eye. All MIC assays were repeated at least in triplicate.
The MBC of hygromycin A against B. bugdorferi was determined in 1.5 mL centrifuge tubes. Exponential phase B31 cultures (10 7 /ml) were incubated with compounds at 1x, 2x, 4x and 8x MIC for 5 days in the microaerophilic chamber. Cells were washed 3 times with BSK-II medium, serially diluted and mixed in semi-agar plates ( Sharma et al., 2015 68. Sharma, B. ∙ Brown, A.V. ∙ Matluck, N.E. ... Borrelia burgdorferi , the causative agent of Lyme disease, forms drug-tolerant persister cells Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2015; 59 :4616-4624 Crossref Scopus (116) PubMed Google Scholar ). All the plates were incubated in the microaerophilic chamber for 20 days before counting. The lowest concentration that killed more than 3 logs of cells was determined as MBC.
A microplate Alamar Blue assay (MABA/resazurin) was used to determine the cytotoxicity of Hygromycin A. The cell lines used were FaDu pharynx squamous cell carcinoma (ATCC HTB-43), HepG2 liver hepatocellular carcinoma (ATCC HB-8065), and HEK293-RFP human embryonic kidney red fluorescent protein tagged (GenTarget SC007) cells, all cultured in Eagle’s Minimum Essential Medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Exponentially growing cells were seeded into a 96-well, flat bottom, tissue culture treated plate (Corning) and incubated at 37°C with 5% CO 2 . After 24 hours, the medium was aspirated and replaced with fresh medium containing test compounds (2 μL of a two-fold serial dilution in water to 98 μL of media). After 72 hours of incubation at 37°C with 5% CO 2 , resazurin (Acros Organics) was added to each well to a final concentration of 0.15 mM. After three hours, the A 544 and A 590 were measured using a BioTek Synergy H1 microplate reader to determine cell viability. Experiments were performed with biological replicates.
Actinomycetes were inoculated into 50 mL Falcon tubes containing 10 mL modified R5 (MR5) medium with 0.1% vitamin supplement (ATCC® MD-VS), and incubated at 28°C with shaking (200 rpm). After 10 days of incubation, 1 mL samples were collected and centrifuged (12,000x g , 10 min) to remove the cells. Culture supernatants (750 μl) were transferred into 96 deep well plates, and dried by centrifugal evaporator. The dried samples were resuspended in 50 μL of water, and yielded 15 times concentrated samples as compared to culture supernatant. Activity of culture extracts were evaluated against B. burgdorferi BbP1286 and counter-screened against S. aureus HG003. Activity against B. burgdorferi BbP1286 was evaluated by measuring GFP fluorescence by plate reader (Synergy H1, BioTek Instruments) with 485/528 nm wavelength. B. burgdorferi BbP1286 was cultured and incubated as described above. After 5 days of growth, the culture was diluted 1:100 into BSKII with 50 μg/mL gentamicin and 100 μg/mL kanamycin. In a 96-well plate, 200 μL of the diluted B. burgdorferi BbP1286 culture as added to 2 μL of extract. The plate was incubated in a microaerophilic chamber for 7 days. A reduction of 80% of the GFP signal compared to cell only control was considered positive anti- Borrelia activity. For the counter-screening, S. aureus exponential phase culture (OD 600 of 0.1-0.9) was diluted to OD 600 of 0.03, and evenly plated onto MHIIA plates. Concentrated samples from the actinomycetes cultures (3 μl) were spotted directly onto the bacterial lawn, and anti- Staphylococcus activity was evaluated based on the presence of a zone of inhibition.
S. hygroscopicus was inoculated in a 250 mL flask containing 40 mL MR5 medium with 0.1% vitamin supplement, and incubated for 7 days at 28°C with shaking (200 rpm). A culture sample (1 mL) was separated into fractions using semi-preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with C 18 reverse-phase column (Ultra C 18 5 μm Column 250 × 10 mm, Restek) and eluted at a flow rate of 5 ml/min. The HPLC apparatus included a Shimadzu HPLC system equipped with an SPD-M20A diode array detector (SHIMADZU Co. Ltd., Japan). The solvent and conditions used were 0 to 5 min of 5% acetonitrile (ACN) that contained 0.1% formic acid (FA), 5 to 30 min of a linear gradient of 5 to 25% ACN that contained 0.1% FA, 30 to 31 min of a linear gradient of 25 to 100% ACN that contained 0.1% FA, and 31 to 40 min of 100% ACN. Culture sample was fractionated every 1 min, and 40 fractions were generated. Each fraction was subjected to bioassay against B. burgdorferi , and activity was observed in samples from retention time 20-21 min.
S. hygroscopicus was inoculated in a 2 L Erlenmeyer flask containing 1 L MR5 medium with 0.1% vitamin supplement and incubated at 28°C with shaking (200 rpm). After 10-14 days of cultivation, the culture was centrifuged, and the cell pellet was removed. The supernatant was treated with XAD16N resin (20–60 mesh, Sigma-Aldrich) to bind the active compound, and incubated overnight with agitation. After discarding supernatant, the active fraction containing hygromycin A was eluted from XAD16N resin with 1L 100% methanol. The methanol extract was dried using a rotary evaporator, and the sample was dissolved in MilliQ water. The sample was then subjected to preparative HPLC with a C 18 reverse-phase column [Luna® 5 μm C 18 (2) 100 Å, LC Column 250 × 21.2 mm, Phenomenex] and eluted at a flow rate of 10 ml/min. The solvent and conditions used were 0 to 5 min of 7% ACN that contained 0.1% FA and 5 to 43 min of a linear gradient of 7 to 15.5% ACN that contained 0.1% FA. Active compound was eluted as single peak at retention time 40 min (HPLC peak at 215nm with purity of approximately 90%).
The HRMS and molecular formula of the active compound were determined by LC-MS/MS analysis on an LTQ Orbitrap XL Hybrid Ion Trap-Orbitrap Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) in positive ion mode coupled with an UltiMate 3000 RSLCnano System chromatography (Dionex). The HPLC purified active fraction was prepared in a concentration of 100 μg/mL in water with 0.1% (v/v) formic acid. The solution was separated at 0.2 μL/min on a capillary column (150 mm by ID 75 μm) packed with C 18 2.5μm resin (XSelect® CSH C 18 ) under water:acetonitrile containing 0.1% (v/v) formic acid starting with 98:2 for 5 minutes followed by 50:50 for 20 minutes. The ion peak in positive mode m/z 512.1763 for C 23 H 30 NO 12 [M+H] + (calculated 512.1768 for C 23 H 30 NO 12 ) was determined by full-scan high resolution electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy analysis, revealing C 23 H 29 NO 12 as the molecular formula ( Figure S1 ).
The compound of molecular mass of 511.17 Da determined by mass spectrometry was a match to hygromycin A in commercially available databases (AntiBase, Wiley). For further structural elucidation, 1 H, 13 C, and various two-dimensional NMR techniques, including 1 H- 1 H correlation spectroscopy (COSY), heteronuclear multiple bond correlation (HMBC), and heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC) were recorded on a 500 MHz on a Varian Inova spectrometer. For comparison with the previously reported hygromycin A data, 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra were recorded in CD 3 OD on 400 MHz Varian Mercury spectrometer ( Figure S2 ). Chemical shifts were in accordance with those previously reported( Lo et al., 2012 44. Lo, H.J. ∙ Chang, Y.K. ∙ Yan, T.H.

(AGCGGATAACAATTTCACACAGGA). The toe-printing analysis of drug-dependent ribosome stalling was carried out as described ( Orelle et al., 2013 55. Orelle, C. ∙ Szal, T. ∙ Klepacki, D. ... Identifying the targets of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase inhibitors by primer extension inhibition Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41 :e144 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ) numbering check. Briefly, the DNA templates (0.1 pmol) were transcribed and translated in a total volume of 5 μL of PURExpress (New England Biolabs, cat # E6800) reactions containing 10 pmol of E. coli ribosomes. Samples were incubated for 30 min at 37°C, followed by addition of the [32 P]-labeled NV1 toe-printing primer ( Vazquez-Laslop et al., 2008 78. Vazquez-Laslop, N. ∙ Thum, C. ∙ Mankin, A.S. Molecular mechanism of drug-dependent ribosome stalling Mol. Cell. 2008; 30 :190-202 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (222) PubMed Google Scholar ). The primer was extended by reverse transcriptase for 10 min and the reaction products were analyzed in sequencing gels. Gels were exposed overnight to the phosphorimager screens and scanned on Typhoon phosphorimager (GE).
The HygA-free ribosomes that escaped translation arrest at the start codon would be arrested at the downstream ‘trap’ codon because the presence of the Thr-tRNA synthetase inhibitor, borrelidin, depletes the system from Thr-tRNA.
(B, C) Toeprinting analysis of ribosome stalling during translation of the (B) ermBL gene or (C) tnaC gene in the absence (lane 1) or the presence of decreasing concentrations of HygA. HygA was present in the reactions at the following concentrations: lane 2: 50 μM, lane 3: 5.5 μM, lane 4: 1.9 μM, lane 6: 0.6 μM. Blue arrowheads mark the toeprint bands representing ribosomes stalled at the start codon. In both templates, the ribosomes could be trapped when Thr codon enters the A site (orange arrowhead) due to the presence of 50 μM of borrelidin in all the samples.
Plating was used to obtain CFU counts. BSK 1.5x medium was prepared as by Samuels ( Samuels, 1995 64. Samuels, D.S. Electrotransformation of the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi Methods Mol. Biol. 1995; 47 :253-259 PubMed Google Scholar ). B. burgdorferi B31 cells (6x 10 7 ) were plated onto semi-solid BSKII medium containing 2x, 4x, and 8x MIC hygromycin A. After a 4-week incubation, 12 colonies were isolated from the 2x MIC plate. The colonies were picked and used to inoculate liquid BSKII medium without hygromycin A to eliminate the effect of transient resistance. This strain was once again challenged with Hygromycin A as described above. After this passage strains were regrown in liquid BSKII without hygromycin A, and the MIC of hygromycin A was checked.
Genomic DNA from KLEx1 and KLEx2 was extracted using the QIAgen DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit per the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA samples were sent to Omega Bioservices for library prep and sequencing using the Illumina Mi-Seq platform. We used Geneious to map parental Borreliella strains to reference genomes from the National Center for Biotechnology Information, and then to map resistant mutants to parental strains. Using Geneious, we also mapped polymorphisms between resistant mutants and parental strains.
The (resistant at 16x MIC HygA, MIC = 0.25ug/ml, 16x MIC = 4ug/ml) was grown to late exponential cultures in 500ml BSK-II, in the presence or absence of 4μg/ml hygromycin A. Treated and untreated cultures grew comparably and reached same cell density (as confirmed by dark-field microscopy). Cells were washed 4x in cold PBS, treated with RNA protect (QIAGEN) according to manufacturer’s instructions, and resuspended in TRIzol (Ambion). RNA was isolated B. burgdorferi hygromyin A resistant mutant KLEx2 using the RNA isolation kit from QIAGEN following the manufactures protocol. Genewiz (South Plainfileld, NJ) carried out further steps including quality control, DNase treatment, rRNA depletion, RNA fragmentation, library preparation, and Illumina HiSeq2x150bp sequencing. Data analysis was performed by Genewiz by trimming and mapping reads to assess differential gene expression.
bmpD was amplified from B. burgdorferi B31 genome with primers NdeI_bmpD (gcgCATATGTTAAAAAAAGTTTATTATTTTTTAATTTTTTTATTTATTGTTGC) and bmpD_XhoI (ggcCTCGAGTTAATTTTCCATTTGCAAAACAAAGTTATCATAAGATACCTTGTC), introducing NdeI and XhoI restriction sites to the 5′ and 3′ end. The B. burgdorferi shuttle vector pJSB275 ( Blevins et al., 2007 9. Blevins, J.S. ∙ Revel, A.T. ∙ Smith, A.H. ...

Rrp2, a prokaryotic enhancer-like binding protein, is essential for viability of Borrelia burgdorferi J. Bacteriol. 2012; 194 :3336-3342 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ) – containing a codon-optimized lacI repressor transcribed from the P flaB promoter and an IPTG-inducible T5 promoter derived from pQE30 – was modified to introduce NdeI and XhoI restriction sites, yielding pJSB275m. The digested PCR fragment was then ligated into pJSB275m backbone and transformed into E. coli DH5α. E. coli transformants were selected with 50 μg/ml spectinomycin. The resulting shuttle vector pJSB275m_bmpD was verified by sequencing with primers pJSB275_up2 (ACCCGGAATAAGCAGTCAAG), pJSB275_down (GCTGCCTTACAAGCCTCTAC) and bmpD-internal_F (CAGGGCTTTCTGGTATAGGG). 30 μg of ethanol precipitated plasmid pJSB275m_bmpD was transformed into electrocompetent B. burgdorferi cells as previously described ( Hyde et al., 2011 34. Hyde, J.A. ∙ Weening, E.H. ∙ Skare, J.T. Genetic transformation of Borrelia burgdorferi Curr. Protoc. Microbiol. 2011; Chapter 12 Unit 12C.4 PubMed Google Scholar ). Transformants were selected with kanamycin (100 μg/ml) and streptomycin (50 μg/ml) by semisolid plating. To quantify growth, plasmid pJSB275m_bmpD was transformed into a B. burgdorferi strain constitutively expressing GFP; Bb1286 ( Caimano et al., 2015 15. Caimano, M.J. ∙ Dunham-Ems, S. ∙ Allard, A.M. ... Cyclic di-GMP modulates gene expression in Lyme disease spirochetes at the tick-mammal interface to promote spirochete survival during the blood meal and tick-to-mammal transmission Infect. Immun. 2015; 83 :3043-3060 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ). Bb1286 was generated from B. burgdorferi strain B31 5A4 NP1 (bbe02 disrupted with PflgB-KanR ( Kawabata et al., 2004 38. Kawabata, H. ∙ Norris, S.J. ∙ Watanabe, H. BBE02 disruption mutants of Borrelia burgdorferi B31 have a highly transformable, infectious phenotype Infect. Immun. 2004; 72 :7147-7154 Crossref Scopus (132) PubMed Google Scholar ) and carries a PflaB_gfp PflgB-aacC1 cassette inserted into the endogenous cp26 plasmid. Bb1286 transformants carrying the bmpD overexpression plasmid were confirmed by PCR and sequencing using primers pJSB275_up2, pJSB275_down and bmpD-internal_F. Plasmid content of transformants was verified by multiplex PCR as previously described ( Bunikis et al., 2011 14. Bunikis, I. ∙ Kutschan-Bunikis, S. ∙ Bonde, M. ... Multiplex PCR as a tool for validating plasmid content of Borrelia burgdorferi J. Microbiol. Methods. 2011; 86 :243-247 Crossref Scopus (90) PubMed Google Scholar ). BmpD overexpression was confirmed by RT-PCR as previously described, using primers bmpD_RT_F (GGATACTTTGCGTCGAAGGC) and bmpD_RT_R (TGCATACTTAGCACCAGCTTCA) and normalizing to the levels of recA ( Bockenstedt et al., 2006 11. Bockenstedt, L.K. ∙ Liu, N. ∙ Schwartz, I. ... MyD88 deficiency enhances acquisition and transmission of Borrelia burgdorferi by Ixodes scapularis ticks Infect. Immun. 2006; 74 :2154-2160 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ).
bmpD was amplified from B. burgdorferi B31 genome with primers SalI_bmpD (gatc GTCGAC AAGCAA GGAGGA TATTTTTATGTTAAAAAAAG) and bmpD_SbfI (gaga CCTGCAGG TTAATTTTCCATTTGCAAAACAAAGTTATCATAAGATACC), introducing SalI and SbfI restriction sites to the 5′ and 3′ end. The digested PCR fragment was then ligated into pBAD30 ( Guzman et al., 1995 30. Guzman, L.M. ∙ Belin, D. ∙ Carson, M.J. ... Tight regulation, modulation, and high-level expression by vectors containing the arabinose PBAD promoter J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177 :4121-4130 Crossref Scopus (4136) PubMed Google Scholar ) backbone and transformed into E. coli DH5α. E. coli transformants were selected with 50 μg/ml ampicillin. Transformants carrying pBAD30_bmpD were verified by sequencing with primers pBAD-F (ATGCCATAGCATTTTTATCC) and pBAD-R (AGTTTATGGCGGGCGTCCTG). Plasmid pBAD30_bmpD was then transformed into E. coli ΔTolC ( Baba et al., 2006 7. Baba, T. ∙ Ara, T. ∙ Hasegawa, M. ... Construction of Escherichia coli K-12 in-frame, single-gene knockout mutants: the Keio collection Mol. Syst. Biol. 2006; 2 :2006.0008 Crossref Scopus (5914) PubMed Google Scholar ) by heat shock. Transformants were selected with kanamycin (50 μg/ml) and ampicillin (50 μg/ml) and verified by sequencing with primers mentioned above.
To investigate the effect of bmpD overexpression in B. burgdorferi on the efficacy of hygromycin A, Bb1286 + pJSB275m_bmpD was grown to early stationary phase in BSK-II medium containing kanamycin (100 μg/ml) and streptomycin (50 μg/ml). Cultures were diluted 1:10 in fresh BSK-II and divided into two; 1mM IPTG was added to one culture, while the other culture remained untreated. Hygromycin A MIC was determined by standard microbroth dilution method, as described previously. Inhibition of growth was measured via GFP fluorescence by a microplate reader (emission 528nm and excitation 485nm). Ceftriaxone was used as a control antibiotic. The MIC of the bmpD -overexpressing B. burgdorferi strain Bb1286 + pJSB275m_bmpD was normalized to the MIC of the wild-type B. burgdorferi strain (Bb1286) for each antibiotic. No growth difference was detected between B1286 + pJSB275m_bmpD with or without 1mM IPTG or as compared to B1286 wild-type, as assessed by daily GFP reads over the course of eight days.
To investigate the effect of bmpD overexpression in E. coli on the efficacy of hygromycin A, E. coli ΔTolC + pBAD30_bmpD was grown to mid exponential phase in M9 minimal medium with 0.2% glycerol as the sole carbon source and then shifted to either 0.2% L-arabinose containing medium for inducing conditions or to 0.2% D-Glucose containing medium for repressing conditions. E. coli ΔTolC carrying the empty plasmid pBAD30 was used as a control. Hygromycin A MIC was determined by standard microbroth dilution method, as described previously. Hygromycin A MIC was also assessed in rich LB medium and in the presence of different concentrations of adenosine (2.5-2500 μM) added to minimal M9 medium with inducing arabinose or repressing glucose conditions. Inhibition of growth was measured via optical density at 600bm by a microplate reader. The hygromycin A MIC of the bmpD overexpressing E. coli strain ΔTolC + pBAD30_bmpD and of the empty plasmid carrying E. coli strain ΔTolC + pBAD30 was normalized to the hygromycin A MIC of wild-type E. coli ΔTolC for each medium. No growth difference was detected between the strains in minimal medium under repressing or inducing conditions, as compared to the wild-type strain, or by addition of indicated concentrations of adenosine, as assessed by measuring optical density at 600nm.
B. burgdorferi and the antibiotic hypersusceptible E. coli strain ΔTolC-Pore ( Zgurskaya and Nikaido, 2000 84. Zgurskaya, H.I. ∙ Nikaido, H. Multidrug resistance mechanisms: drug efflux across two membranes Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37 :219-225 Crossref Scopus (402) PubMed Google Scholar ) were grown in BSKII and MOPS-M9 (pH 7.2) media, respectively. At OD 600 = 0.1-0.2 for E. coli and = 0.01-0.02 for B. burgdorferi , 50 mL of cell cultures were pelleted by centrifugation at room temperature (RT). Cells were washed twice in MOPS-M9 and concentrated 20-fold. Cells were incubated with 16, 32, 64 and 128 μg/mL of antibiotics and after 1 and 40 min incubation at room temperature, 100 μL cell aliquots were collected by vacuum filtration onto 1.0 μm Glass Fiber Type B filters. Filters were washed twice with 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), dried and placed into 100% methanol at −80°C for at least 10 min. Intracellular material was extracted by water bath sonication for 1 min. Cell and filter debris were separated by ultracentrifugation at 100,000xg for 8 min at 16°C and the pellet re-extracted with 80% methanol in water by sonication for 15 min followed by ultracentrifugation at the same conditions. Supernatants from two extractions were combined, evaporated to dryness under a vacuum and resuspended in 60 μL of 100% methanol. For compound quantification, 5 μL of solution was analyzed in triplicates. The calibration curve for hygromycin was generated in the same experiment by mixing antibiotic at increasing concentrations with the sonicated E. coli cell extracts ( Figure S3 .).
An Agilent 1290 Infinity II ultrahigh-pressure liquid chromatography (UHPLC) system and 6545 quadrupole/time-of-flight (Q/TOF) system (Agilent Technologies) were used to quantify hygromycin. A Zorbax Rapid Resolution High Definition column (RRHD, 2.1x50mm, 1.8 μm) was used for the separation with a flow rate of 0.65 mL/min. The initial concentration of 5% MS grade Acetonitrile was maintained for 1 min, followed by a linear gradient to 80% over 3 min, and then by 100% over 1.1 min which was maintained for an additional 1.2 min. HPLC solvent mixtures contained 0.1% HPLC grade formic acid (SigmaAldrich) to improve ionization efficiency. MS parameters were as follows: gas temperature, 325°C; capillary voltage, 4000V; fragmentor voltage, 175V; m/z range, 50–1100; detector signal acquisition rate, 4GHz; and spectrum storage rate, 2 s -1 . MassHunter qualitative and quantitative analysis B8.0 was used to quantify the hygromycin A concentration using the calibration curve.
Hygromycin A was mixed with clarified E. coli cell lysates and analyzed by UHPLC/MS. At each concentration, the compound was injected in triplicates. The data were fit into a linear dependence and were used to calculate intracellular levels of antibiotic.
For hygromycin A accumulation in E. coli Δ tolC (pBAD30) and E. coli Δ tolC (pBAD30bmpD) cells, Rapidfire RF365 (Agilent technologies) coupled to a quadrupole time of flight (Q/TOF) 6545 mass spectrometer (Agilent technologies) was used. E. coli cells were grown in MOPS-M9 medium supplemented with 0.2% glycerol overnight, induced with 0.2% arabinose for 1 hour and concentrated 10-fold. The uptake was measured at increasing external hygromycin A concentrations (16-128 μg/ml). Intracellular material was extracted in two steps, (i) water and (ii) 50% methanol, by 96-well sonication for 2 min twice. Samples were aspirated during 500 ms into a 20 uL loop, then absorbed to a solid phase extraction C18 cartridge. Samples were washed for 3 s with 5 mM ammonium formate with a flow rate of 1.5 mL/min, then eluted from the cartridge to the mass spectrometer with 100% methanol containing 0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 1.00 mL/min for 6 s. The system is then re-equilibrated with 5 mM of ammonium formate for 1 s. MSMS transition of 511.17 to 177.09 was used to quantify hygromycin A. MS parameters were as follows: gas temperature, 325°C; capillary voltage, 4000V; fragmentor voltage, 175V; m/z range, 50–1100; detector signal acquisition rate, 4GHz; collision energy 22 V and spectrum storage rate, 6.s -1 . MassHunter quantitative analysis B8.0 was used to quantify hygromycin A concentration using the calibration curve.
All animal experiments were conducted according to protocols that were approved by the Institute of Animal Care and Usage Committee (IACUC) at Northeastern University (Approval #16 −0619). Wild-type female C3H mice (Charles River Laboratories) were infected with 10 5 B. burgdorferi N40 cells by subcutaneous injection, with no fewer than 3 animals per treatment group. Ear punches were collected from each animal after 2 weeks of infection and cultured into BSK-II media to confirm infection. The infection was established for 3 weeks, and then animals were dosed twice a day for 5 days with saline or ceftriaxone (156 mg/kg) by intraperitoneal injection, Hygromycin A (25, 50, 70 and 250 mg/kg) by oral gavage and 100 mg/kg by intraperitoneal injection.
The mouse and B. burgdorferi RNA from infected tissue was extracted using RNAeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN). cDNA was synthesized using High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kits (Applied Biosysterms). Real -time PCR was performed with primers targeting the 16S rDNA gene (F: 5′- GGT CAA GAC TGA CGC TGA GTC and R: 5`GGC TTA GAA CTA ACG CTG) using SYBR green Supermix (Bio -RAD). B. burgdorferi N40 copy number was normalized to cDNA standard curve synthesized from a known copy number of B. burgdorferi cells.
To prepare the mouse bait, 2 g of Bait formulation 3 (Food source), 0.5 g freshly ground peanut butter (Whole foods), 35 μl of green food coloring mix (Whole foods) were added into a 60 mm Petri dish. Boiling water (4 mL) was added and mixed with a spatula. The mixture was then dispensed into wells of a 96 well plate with a spatula such that about 2/3 of the well was full. Antibiotics or vehicle were added at appropriate volume and mixed with a pipette tip. Added volume was kept below 60 μL per well. The bait was allowed to air dry/solidify for a few hours and the prepared baits were stored at 4°C until use.
After one day of fasting, the animals were given bait once a day for 5 days containing Hygromycin A (200 mg/kg) or Doxycycline (100 mg/kg). Control groups included uninfected and infected animals, both given untreated bait. To ensure that the bait would be consumed, mice were housed individually with their mouse chow withheld during treatment. The doses used in mice were matched to the pharmacokinetic profile of humans given 1 g ceftriaxone every 12 hours (Sai Life Sciences Ltd, India) and 100 mg doxycycline every 12 hours ( Bockenstedt et al., 2002 10. Bockenstedt, L.K. ∙ Mao, J. ∙ Hodzic, E. ... Detection of attenuated, noninfectious spirochetes in Borrelia burgdorferi -infected mice after antibiotic treatment J. Infect. Dis. 2002; 186 :1430-1437 Crossref Scopus (103) PubMed Google Scholar ; Crandon et al., 2010 18. Crandon, J.L. ∙ Kuti, J.L. ∙ Nicolau, D.P. Comparative efficacies of human simulated exposures of telavancin and vancomycin against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus with a range of vancomycin MICs in a murine pneumonia model Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2010; 54 :5115-5119 Crossref Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Animals were sacrificed 3 days after completion of antibiotic treatment and skin (whole ear), heart, and quadricep muscle were collected. Skin was used for liquid culture, and RNA extraction. All other tissues were used for RNA extraction. The growth of B. burgdorferi in 10 day liquid cultures was detected by dark field microscopy with a 100x objective.
Efficacy studies of hygromycin A in eradicating B. burgdorferi from infected mice were performed by infecting Peromyscus leucopus mice by subcutaneous inoculation with 10 6 B. burgdorferi B31. After 3 weeks, mice were administered hygromycin A by oral gavage at either 50 mg/kg or 100 mg/kg twice daily for 5 days. Ear punches were taken each day for culture in BSKII media containing rifampicin, phosphomycin and amphotericin B while the mice were treated with hygromycin A. An additional ear punch culture was performed on Day 7. Mice were sacrificed on Day 11 and the heart, ankle, ear and inoculation skin site were taken for culture. Cultures were monitored by darkfield microscopy for 4 weeks or until positive.
Wild-type female C3H mice (Charles River Laboratories) were infected with 10 5 B. burgdorferi N40 cells by subcutaneous injection. The infection was established for 3 weeks, and then animals were dosed twice a day for 5 days with ceftriaxone (156 mg/kg) (Sigma) by subcutaneous injection, Amoxicillin (100 mg/kg) (Goldbio) by oral gavage, or Hygromycin A (50 mg/kg) by oral gavage, or were left untreated (n = 4-5 per group per experiment, 3 experiments). Fecal pellets were collected 3 days before and 3 days after antibiotic treatment and were stored at −80°C in PBS. Sequencing of a stool pellet from each mouse before and after treatment was performed by MR DNA ( https://www.mrdnalab.com , Shallowater, TX, USA) on an Ion Torrent PGM. Using PCR primers 515F (GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA) and 806R (GGACTACVSGGGTATCTAAT), the V4 variable region of the 16SrRNA gene was amplified in a single-step 30 cycle PCR with the HotStarTaq Plus Master Mix Kit (QIAGEN, USA). The following conditions were used: 94°C for 3 minutes and 30 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 53°C for 40 s and 72°C for 1 minute, then a final elongation step for 5 minutes at 72°C. These data were analyzed with a proprietary analysis pipeline (MR DNA, Shallowater, TX, USA). Barcodes and primers and then sequences < 150 bp were removed. Further, sequences with homopolymer runs exceeding 6 bp and sequences with ambiguous calls were removed. The sequences were then denoised, OTUs were generated, and chimeras were removed; OTUs were clustered at 3% divergence. Taxonomic classification was performed using BLASTn against a database derived from RDPII ( http://rdp.cme.msu.edu ) and NCBI ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov ). The change in relative abundance of the most abundant genera from before to after treatment of each individual mouse was reported. Further, raw sequences were processed in Qiita ( Gonzalez et al., 2018 25. Gonzalez, A. ∙ Navas-Molina, J.A. ∙ Kosciolek, T. ... Qiita: rapid, web-enabled microbiome meta-analysis Nat. Methods. 2018; 15 :796-798 Crossref Scopus (362) PubMed Google Scholar ) and were demultiplexed, trimmed to 100 bp, and closed reference OTU picking was performed against the Greengenes database ( McDonald et al., 2012 48. McDonald, D. ∙ Price, M.N. ∙ Goodrich, J. ... An improved Greengenes taxonomy with explicit ranks for ecological and evolutionary analyses of bacteria and archaea ISME J. 2012; 6 :610-618 Crossref Scopus (3872) PubMed Google Scholar ) at 97% similarity. The alpha diversity based on the Simpson index was calculated in Qiita. The change in the Simpson index was calculated for the fecal microbiome of each mouse from before to after treatment. Statistical significance was calculated using a one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test (p < 0.05).
GraphPad Prism was used for statistical analysis. All of the statistical details for each experiment are described in the figure legends. A P value ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
