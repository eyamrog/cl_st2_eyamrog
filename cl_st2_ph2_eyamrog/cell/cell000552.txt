Title: Structural and functional characterizations of infectivity and immune evasion of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron


Abstract: Summary

The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant with increased fitness is spreading rapidly worldwide. Analysis of cryo-EM structures of the spike (S) from Omicron reveals amino acid substitutions forging interactions that stably maintain an active conformation for receptor recognition. The relatively more compact domain organization confers improved stability and enhances attachment but compromises the efficiency of the viral fusion step. Alterations in local conformation, charge, and hydrophobic microenvironments underpin the modulation of the epitopes such that they are not recognized by most NTD- and RBD-antibodies, facilitating viral immune escape. Structure of the Omicron S bound with human ACE2, together with the analysis of sequence conservation in ACE2 binding region of 25 sarbecovirus members, as well as heatmaps of the immunogenic sites and their corresponding mutational frequencies, sheds light on conserved and structurally restrained regions that can be used for the development of broad-spectrum vaccines and therapeutics.

Section: Introduction

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been continuously evolving through mutations in its viral genome, resulting in increased transmissibility, infectivity, and immune escape as observed among emerging variants of concerns (VOCs). Four widely circulated VOCs, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta, have been previously characterized, among which the Beta variant showed the greatest magnitude of immune evasion from neutralizing antibodies, whereas Delta exhibited dramatically enhanced transmission and infectivity ( Davies et al., 2021 10.

A newly identified VOC, named the Omicron variant (B.1.1.529), with an unprecedented number of mutations, is quickly spreading worldwide. Although the Delta variant remains the most prevalent strain currently, the Omicron variant is likely to become dominant by early 2022 as predicted by mathematical models ( Kumar et al., 2021 17. Kumar, S. ∙ Thambiraja, T.S. ∙ Karuppanan, K. ... Omicron and Delta Variant of SARS-CoV-2: A Comparative Computational Study of Spike Protein Journal of medical virology. 2021; Crossref Scopus (370) Google Scholar ). The Omicron spike (S) harbors over 30 amino acid substitutions, 15 of which are in the receptor binding domain (RBD). These include three new clusters: (1) S371L, S373P and S375F, (2) N440K and G446S, and (3) Q493, G496, Q498, and Y505H, as well as other accumulated mutations, such as K417N, S477N, T478K, E484A, and N501Y ( Figure 1 A), presumably conferring greater resistance to neutralizing antibodies and vaccine-induced humoral immunity ( Cameroni et al., 2021 4.

Liu, L. ∙ Iketani, S. ∙ Guo, Y. ... Striking Antibody Evasion Manifested by the Omicron Variant of SARS-CoV-2 Nature. 2021; Crossref Scopus (812) Google Scholar ). Three small deletions (Δ69-70, Δ143-145, and Δ212), one 3-residue insertion (ins214EPE), and four substitutions (A67V, T95I, G142D, and N211I) in the N-terminal domain (NTD) probably alter its local conformation, presumably disrupting the original antigenic site existing in the wild type (WT) and also affecting viral infectivity ( Figure 1 A). In addition, mutations near by the furin cleavage site like H655Y, N679K, and P681H might be implicated in proteolytic activation since the P681R substitution identified in Delta could enhance viral fusogenicity and pathogenicity ( Saito et al., 2021 32.

Preliminary data suggest that the Omicron variant escapes almost all clinically approved antibody therapeutics, significantly impairs humoral immunity elicited by natural infection and vaccination, and possesses higher transmission rates among household contacts than those of the Delta variant, attributing to a higher risk of yet another resurgence of the pandemic ( Lu et al., 2021 22.

SARS-CoV-2 can enter into host cells through endosomes as well as the cellular surface, with inhibition of the activity of both the endosomal cathepsin L and the cell-surface membrane protein TMPRSS2 required to fully block its entry ( Hoffmann et al., 2020 15.

The entry for SARS-CoV-2 involves interactions of S with the ACE2 receptor and known or unidentified attachment cofactors, and subsequent priming of the protein by host cell proteases ( Lan et al., 2020 19.

These two key events advance the life cycle of the virus from the prefusion to the postfusion stage, leading to the fusion of the viral membrane with that of the host cell ( Hoffmann et al., 2020 15. Hoffmann, M. ∙ Kleine-Weber, H. ∙ Schroeder, S. ...

Double lock of a potent human therapeutic monoclonal antibody against SARS-CoV-2 National Science Review. 2021; 8 :nwaa297 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ); details of which are not clearly understood. A set of substitutions, generally comprising of no more than three amino acids, in the RBD of four previous VOCs, have been shown to be associated with an increased affinity toward ACE2 ( Zhou et al., 2021 51. Zhou, D. ∙ Dejnirattisai, W. ∙ Supasa, P. ... Evidence of escape of SARS-CoV-2 variant B. 1.351 from natural and vaccine-induced sera Cell. 2021; 184 :2348-2361.e2346 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (717) PubMed Google Scholar ). Surprisingly, the Omicron RBD has nine substitutions (K417N, G446S, S477N, E484A, Q493R, G496S, Q498R, N501Y, and Y505H), that are located on the ACE2 binding interface, considerably affecting the receptor recognition, cell tropism, and entry pattern, particularly in combination with other mutations such as H655Y, N679K, and P681H ( Figure 1 A). Thus, understanding the underlying molecular basis for the enhanced transmissibility, immune resistance, and virological properties of the Omicron variant may facilitate development of intervention strategies to halt this looming crisis.

Section: Results

Based on the first reported genome sequence of the Omicron variant ( Figure 1 A), we expressed prefusion-stabilized soluble trimeric ectodomain (S-trimer), which contains GSAS mutations at the furin cleavage site and 6P mutations along with the T4 fibritin trimerization domain ( Lv et al., 2020 23. Lv, Z. ∙ Deng, Y.-Q. ∙ Ye, Q. ... Structural basis for neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV by a potent therapeutic antibody Science. 2020; 369 :1505-1509 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wrapp et al., 2020 43. Wrapp, D. ∙ Wang, N. ∙ Corbett, K.S. ... Cryo-EM structure of the 2019-nCoV spike in the prefusion conformation Science. 2020; 367 :1260-1263 Crossref Scopus (95) PubMed Google Scholar ), and purified the protein to homogeneity by affinity chromatography and size-exclusion chromatography ( Figure S1 ). To explore the effect of endosomal pH on triggering conformational alterations, purified S-trimer was dialyzed against PBS buffer (pH 7.5) and acidic solution (0.1M Sodium citrate, pH 5.5), separately. We determined asymmetric cryo-EM reconstructions of the Omicron S-trimer at a resolution of 3.3 Å and 3.9 Å under neutral and acidic pH conditions ( Figures 1 B, 1C, and S1 and Table S1 ), respectively. Previous cryo-EM structures had revealed two prevalent prefusion conformations (but not limited to two) for SARS-CoV-2 S-trimer, including Alpha, Beta, and Kappa variants: a single-up conformation and all-down conformation, related to the positioning of the RBD ( Cai et al., 2021 3. Cai, Y. ∙ Zhang, J. ∙ Xiao, T. ... Structural basis for enhanced infectivity and immune evasion of SARS-CoV-2 variants Science. 2021; 373 :642-648 Crossref Scopus (158) PubMed Google Scholar ). By contrast, only one conformational state with one “up” RBD and two “down” RBDs was observed in structures of the Omicron S-trimer, either at pH 7.5 or pH 5.5 ( Figures 1 B and 1C). Distinct from multiple orientations of RBD in the S-trimer at pH 5.5 ( Zhou et al., 2020 50. Zhou, T. ∙ Tsybovsky, Y. ∙ Gorman, J. ... Cryo-EM structures of SARS-CoV-2 spike without and with ACE2 reveal a pH-dependent switch to mediate endosomal positioning of receptor-binding domains Cell Host & Microbe. 2020; 28 :867-879.e865 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (229) PubMed Google Scholar ), structural heterogeneity in the Omicron S-trimer seems largely decreased, even when examined at endosomal pH. Overall structures of neutral and acidic Omicron S-trimer are indistinguishable, apart from some disorder on the NTD and RBM of the acidic S-trimer ( Figures 1 B, 1C, and S2 ).
To further provide insights into the structural heterogeneity, we also determined near-atomic structures of the Delta S-trimer using the same strategy ( Figure S1 and Table S1 ). In line with WT and most variants, Delta S-trimer exhibits two distinct conformational states corresponding to a closed form with all three RBDs down and an open form with one RBD up ( Figure S3 ). To investigate structural basis for the stabilized up conformation, we further scrutinized these structures and used S-trimer structures from Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta for in-depth comparison ( Figures 2 and S3 ). Strikingly, a highly compact domain organization at the interface between the up S-monomer (defined as mol A) and its adjacent down RBD (defined as mol B) was observed in Omicron ( Figures 2 A and 2B). Compared to the other S-trimers, the domain shifts include a >12° and >6° clockwise rotation of the NTD (mol A, colored in yellow) and down RBD (mol B, colored in blue), respectively, together with a counterclockwise rotation of the SD1 (mol A, colored in cyan) and up RBD (mol A, colored in violet), underpinning the up configuration with buried areas of 450 Å 2 between two contacted RBDs ( Figures 2 A, 2B, and S3 ). These extensive contacts were primarily due to hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions, which were largely mediated by the nine mutations within two patches ( Figures 2 C and 2E). Substitutions of Q493R, G496S, Q498R, N501Y, and Y505H in the Omicron RBD (mol B) and K378, Y380, D427, and G413 from the up RBD (mol A) established five hydrogen bonds not observed in Delta ( Figures 2 C and 2D). Furthermore, four-residue mutations with completely opposite characteristics from hydrophilic to hydrophobic, including S371L, S373P, S375F, and E484A, together with Y369, A373, F374, V483, G485, and F486 have resulted in massive hydrophobic interactions ( Figures 2 E and 2F). Previous studies observed that distal regions of the S, such as furin cleavage loop and D614G, can lead to allosteric effects on RBD open/down disposition ( Yurkovetskiy et al., 2020 47. Yurkovetskiy, L. ∙ Wang, X. ∙ Pascal, K.E. ... Structural and functional analysis of the D614G SARS-CoV-2 spike protein variant Cell. 2020; 183 :739-751.e738 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (677) PubMed Google Scholar ). Apart from these, the FPPR segment (fusion peptide proximal region, residues 828–853) and 630 loop (residues 620–640) are also proposed to modulate the S stability and structural rearrangements ( Cai et al., 2021 3. Cai, Y. ∙ Zhang, J. ∙ Xiao, T. ... Structural basis for enhanced infectivity and immune evasion of SARS-CoV-2 variants Science. 2021; 373 :642-648 Crossref Scopus (158) PubMed Google Scholar ). For the Omicron, the FPPR and 630 loop were well resolved in the RBD-down conformation, whereas they were partially ordered in the RBD-up conformation ( Figure S3 ), which is also consistent with a recent report that the FPPR segment and 630 loop facilitate clamping down of the RBDs in the closed form ( Cai et al., 2021 3. Cai, Y. ∙ Zhang, J. ∙ Xiao, T. ... Structural basis for enhanced infectivity and immune evasion of SARS-CoV-2 variants Science. 2021; 373 :642-648 Crossref Scopus (158) PubMed Google Scholar ). These structural observations explain the decreased structural heterogeneity for Omicron S.
Viral stability, particularly that of surface proteins like S-trimer, closely correlates with its entry efficiency, viral transmission, adaptability, and immunogenicity ( Laha et al., 2020 18. Laha, S. ∙ Chakraborty, J. ∙ Das, S. ... Characterizations of SARS-CoV-2 mutational profile, spike protein stability and viral transmission Infect. Genet. Evol. 2020; 85 :104445 Crossref Scopus (147) PubMed Google Scholar ). In spite of adopting an up configuration, the Omicron S-trimer exhibits a much more compact architecture in the regions formed by three copies of S2 and RBD, representing a highly stabilized conformation ( Figure 3 A). Consequently, the Omicron S-trimer possesses substantially increased intersubunit (mol A–mol B) interactions of up to 5,455 Å 2 , when compared to its counterparts from Delta with buried areas of 4,447 Å 2 ( Figure 3 B). Similarly, improved intersubunit contacts from either S2-S2 or S1-S1 are also clearly observed, thereby conferring enhanced stability for the Omicron S-trimer in prefusion conformation ( Figure 3 B). To further investigate the molecular basis for observed tight domain organization in Omicron, superimposition of S2 from Delta and Omicron revealed two local conformational shifts at intersubunit interfaces (residues 849–858 and 968–988) ( Figure 3 C). In the broader context of the S-trimer, the N856K, N969K, and T547K (in SD1) changes from a short side chain to a long one building up three hydrogen bonds with D658 (in SD1), Q755, and S982 from neighboring subunits, pulling the three subunits closer ( Figure 3 C). Additionally, the substitution of D796Y can stabilize the sugar at residue N709 from its adjacent subunit through forming a hydrogen bond ( Figure 3 D). In line with structural observations, thermal stability assays verified that the Omicron S-trimer was more stable than those from WT and Delta ( Figure 3 E).
In general, improved stability, to some extent, might increase the persistence of the Omicron variant in the exposed environments, posing a higher risk of transmission among household contacts when compared to the Delta variant. Theoretically, improved stability can facilitate viral attachment to the host cells via increasing receptor recognition efficiency; however, viral membrane fusion may be compromised. To test this, analysis of trypsin- or trypsin- and ACE2-mediated S fusogenic conformational rearrangements ( Walls et al., 2019 35. Walls, A.C. ∙ Xiong, X. ∙ Park, Y.-J. ... Unexpected receptor functional mimicry elucidates activation of coronavirus fusion Cell. 2019; 176 :1026-1039.e1015 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (411) PubMed Google Scholar ) evaluated by negatively stained EM was performed ( Figure 3 F). Analysis of the negatively stained sample showed that the Omicron S-trimer largely remained in the prefusion conformation and was relatively stable in presence of trypsin and ACE2 at room temperature ( Figure 3 F). While the same treatment led to formation of more postfusion rosettes for the Delta S-trimer, suggesting that the viral fusion efficiency for the Omicron S-trimer is possibly declined ( Figure 3 F). These results also largely match the experimental observations of a significant reduction in syncitia formation during the Omicron infection ( Meng et al., 2021 26. Meng, B. ∙ Ferreira, I. ∙ Abdullahi, A. ... SARS-CoV-2 Omicron spike mediated immune escape, infectivity and cell-cell fusion bioRxiv. 2021; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ), despite the presence of the P681H substitution, a similar change of P681R, which is known to favor S1/S2 cleavage and enhance viral fusogenicity in Delta ( Saito et al., 2021 32. Saito, A. ∙ Irie, T. ∙ Suzuki, R. ..., Genotype to Phenotype Japan (G2P-Japan) Consortium Enhanced fusogenicity and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 Delta P681R mutation Nature. 2021; Crossref Scopus (323) Google Scholar ).
The overall architectures of the Omicron S-trimer resemble those of WT and other VOCs in the corresponding conformation ( Figures 2 A and S3 ). However, the Omicron variant can escape the majority of existing SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) and humoral immune responses elicited by natural infection or vaccinations, indicative of a considerably altered antigenic structure. The RBD and NTD are two main targets of neutralization in SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses ( Cerutti et al., 2021 7. Cerutti, G. ∙ Guo, Y. ∙ Zhou, T. ...

A proof of concept for neutralizing antibody-guided vaccine design against SARS-CoV-2 National Science Review. 2021; 8 :nwab053 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ). Superimpositions of RBD and NTD of the WT and Omicron S clearly revealed local conformational alterations in antigenic loops ( Figures 4 A and 4B). Among these, the most striking differences are in the NTD, which contains three small deletions, one 3-residue insertion and four substitutions ( Figure 1 A). The mutation A67V together with Δ69-70 triggers the conformational changes in N2 loop. Similarly, N211I and Δ212, as well as ins214EPE, alter the configuration of the loop (defined as N4a) encompassing residues 209–216 located adjacent to N4 loop ( Figures 4 A and S4 ). Remarkably, the substitution of G142D as well as Δ143-145 leads to a reconfiguration of N3 loop from a hair-pin fold to a loose loop. This reorganization, together with the N4a loop, further mediates conformational changes in its neighboring loops N4 and N5 ( Figures 4 A and S4 ). Of note, an antigenic supersite comprising N3 and N5 is completely altered in Omicron ( Cerutti et al., 2021 7. Cerutti, G. ∙ Guo, Y. ∙ Zhou, T. ...

A proof of concept for neutralizing antibody-guided vaccine design against SARS-CoV-2 National Science Review. 2021; 8 :nwab053 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ), structurally explaining the observation that nearly all NTD-targeting NAbs have lost their activities against Omicron. Two major antigenic sites consisting of the 5-6 loop (residues 475–485) and 6-7 loop (residues 492–505) are widely targeted by very potent NAbs via blocking ACE2 binding ( Figures 4 B and S4 ) but can be substantially impaired by T478K, E484K, and N501Y substitutions observed in several VOCs ( Dejnirattisai et al., 2021 11. Dejnirattisai, W. ∙ Zhou, D. ∙ Ginn, H.M. ...

Concernedly, newly occurred mutations, S477N, Q493R, G496S, Q498R, and Y505H, together with three already existing mutations, further alter the antigenic characteristics, leading to a striking evasion of the antibody. Substitution like S371L, S373P, and S375F also cause a clear conformational change in the loop connecting α2 and β2, another antigenic site that is generally conserved across sarbecoviruses ( Lv et al., 2020 23.

A broadly cross-reactive antibody neutralizes and protects against sarbecovirus challenge in mice Science translational medicine. 2021; eabj7125 Google Scholar ) ( Figures 4 B and S4 ). In addition to local conformational alterations, the Omicron RBD and NTD exhibit an increased positively charged and negatively charged surface, respectively, when compared to those of WT ( Figures 4 C–4E).
RBD-targeting NAbs can generally be categorized into six classes (from I to VI) based on cluster analysis on epitope from 280 available RBD-NAb complex structures ( Figure 5 A) ( Wang et al., 2021a 39. Wang, K. ∙ Cao, Y. ∙ Zhou, Y. ... A third dose of inactivated vaccine augments the potency, breadth, and duration of anamnestic responses against SARS-CoV-2 medRxiv. 2021; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ) that are also related to the four/five groups on the basis of competition with the hACE2 for binding to S ( Barnes et al., 2020 1.

Structural and functional ramifications of antigenic drift in recent SARS-CoV-2 variants Science. 2021; 373 :818-823 Crossref Scopus (227) PubMed Google Scholar ). We constructed an antigenic heatmap for RBD using the 280 NAb complex structures to estimate in vivo antibody recognition frequencies on the RBD ( Figure 5 B). The first three classes of antibodies targeting the RBM with partially overlapped epitopes are highly potent by way of blocking the interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2. Class I antibodies, primarily derived from IGHV3-53/IGHV3-66 with short HCDR3s, recognize only the up RBD and make significant contacts with K417, Q493, N501, and Y505 ( Figure 5 B). Class III antibodies bound to RBD either in up or down configuration extensively associate with E484, Q493, and partially with L452 ( Figure 5 B). Class II antibodies bind the patch between sites I and III, frequently interacting with S477, T478, E484, Q493, and Y505 ( Figure 5 B). Class IV antibodies attach to the right shoulder of RBD with relatively condensed epitopes comprising residues 440–450 ( Figure 5 B). Class V and VI antibodies, generally cross reactive to sarbecoviruses, target two cryptic epitopes, consisting of residues 351–357, 462–471, and 368–385, respectively, which are only accessible when at least one RBD is in the open state ( Figure 5 B).
To gain information about the types of NAbs that could either completely lose or show a dramatic reduction in neutralizing activities against Omicron, we performed pseudovirus assays. The neutralization activity profile of 18 well-characterized antibodies from all six classes ( Figure 5 C), except for Brii-198, whose neutralizing datasets were published recently, was evaluated ( Liu et al., 2021b 21. Liu, L. ∙ Iketani, S. ∙ Guo, Y. ... Striking Antibody Evasion Manifested by the Omicron Variant of SARS-CoV-2 Nature. 2021; Crossref Scopus (812) Google Scholar ). Among these, neutralization of five of the six classes of NAbs was strikingly escaped by Omicron ( Figures 5 C and S5 ). For Class I NAbs represented by LY-CoV016, substitutions of Q493R and N501Y with longer side chains induced steric clashes with Y102, M101 from HCDR3, and S30 from LCDR1, respectively; mutation K417N further broke the salt bridge with D104 from HCDR3, leading to inactivity in binding to Omicrom S ( Figure 5 D). Regarding Class II antibodies, e.g., REGN10933, changes of K417N and E484A disrupted hydrogen bonds established by D31 from LCDR1 and Y563, S56 from HCDR2, respectively; mutation Q493R also directly clashed with S30 from LCDR1, resulting in the antibody losing its capacity to bind Omicron S ( Figure 5 D). Similarly, the mutation Q493R caused severe clashes with R104 from HCDR3, and E484A abolished charge interactions with R50 from HCDR2 and R96 from LCDR3, resulting in the inability of Class III antibodies exemplified by LY-CoV555 to bind to the Omicron S ( Figure 5 D). In addition to existing mutations like K417N, E484A, and N501Y, the Q493R mutation, or a similar mutation, Q493K, have previously been detected through in vitro resistance mapping efforts or in immunocompromised hosts ( Baum et al., 2020 2.

Escape from neutralizing antibodies by SARS-CoV-2 spike protein variants eLife. 2020; 9 :e61312 Crossref Scopus (887) PubMed Google Scholar ). The Q493R mutation acts as one extra key immune escape site in Omicron, which in conjunction with local conformational changes caused by other nearby mutations, leads to greater resistance to Class I–III antibodies via steric clashes. Disruption of the hydrophobic microenvironment constructed by interactions between V445, G447, and P499 from RBD and Y35; V50, Y59, and Y105 from HCDRs of REGN10987, a representative antibody from Class IV antibodies by the G446S substitution; and the moderate clash between mutation N440K with Y102 from HCDR3 reduces binding affinities of the antibodies to Omicron S dramatically ( Cao et al., 2021 6. Cao, Y.R. ∙ Wang, J. ∙ Jian, F. ... B. 1.1. 529 escapes the majority of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies of diverse epitopes bioRxiv. 2021; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ) ( Figure 5 D). As mentioned above, substitutions of S371L, S373P, and S375F drove a distinct conformational shift, stabilizing two adjacent RBDs (one up and one down) ( Figures 2 E and 3 B), which consequently altered the relatively conserved antigenic site, mainly targeted by Class VI antibodies ( Figure 5 D). Fortunately, epitopes of Class V antibodies are mostly beyond the mutated patch, thereby less affected by Omicron, although most NAbs from this class are less potent. Given that an additional R346K mutation has been frequently detected in Omicron, accounting for ∼26% of the cases, we also constructed another pseudovirus (Omicron+R346K) containing this mutation for assessing neutralization by these representative NAbs ( Figure 5 C). The overall results resembled those observed for Omicron, with the exception that the neutralizing activities of AZD1061 (CoV2-2130) were further diminished ( Figures 5 C and S5 ). In summary, we dissected the evasion of neutralization of the five classes of NAbs by Omicron and identified two unidentified immune escape sites: G446S and S371L/S373P/S375F, which together with existing substitutions confer greater resistance to five of the six classes of RBD-antibodies.
Unexpectedly, nine out of fifteen substitutions in the Omicron RBD are located on the human ACE2 binding interface, which considerably affects receptor recognition. We measured the binding affinities of WT and Omicron RBD to ACE2 by surface plasmon resonance (SPR), in which the CM5 biosensor was labeled with amine-coupling ACE2 and flooded with the Omicron or WT RBD in the flow-through. ( Figure 6 A). The Omicron RBD showed a 2.8-fold increased binding affinity to human ACE2 compared to the WT RBD ( Figure 6 A). To further unveil molecular details of the binding, we determined cryo-EM structures of the Omicron S-trimer in complex with human ACE2 at 3.5 Å ( Figures 6 B and S1 and Tables S1 and S2 ). The structure showed two copies of ACE2 bound to two RBDs (mol A and mol C) in the up conformation. The stabilized up S-monomer showed no notable conformational alterations upon ACE2 binding, but the other up S-monomer had a wider angle between NTD, SD2, SD1, and RBD that was triggered by ACE2 ( Figure 6 C), suggesting that the stabilized up configuration is tolerant to the interference by ACE2 binding, probably antibody binding as well. Local refinement of the RBD-ACE2 region resulted in a reliable density map for analysis of the mode of interaction between Omicron S and ACE2 ( Figure S1 ). Structural comparisons of the key interactions at the interface between the Omicron/WT and ACE2 revealed that new substitutions of T478K, Q493R, G496S, and Q498R strengthened the binding of Omicron to ACE2 by establishing hydrogen bonds or salt bridges with Q24, E35, K353, and D38, respectively ( Figure 6 D). Together with the N501Y, a mutation known to improve the binding affinity by 6-fold ( Zhou et al., 2021 51. Zhou, D. ∙ Dejnirattisai, W. ∙ Supasa, P. ... Evidence of escape of SARS-CoV-2 variant B. 1.351 from natural and vaccine-induced sera Cell. 2021; 184 :2348-2361.e2346 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (717) PubMed Google Scholar ), these mutations facilitate the binding of Omicron to ACE2. Meanwhile, mutations K417N and E484A decreased binding affinity to ACE2 via breaking two hydrogen bonds in Omicron. This reduction in affinity is offset by the interactions forged by other mutations. Overall, the Omicron variant possesses improved binding to ACE2.

Section: Discussion

Viruses latch on to receptors using conserved residues. Many members of the β-Coronavirus lineage B (termed sarbecoviruses), including SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 variants and civet-, bat-, and pangolin-derived sarbecoviruses, can utilize human ACE2 to enter host cells ( Liu et al., 2021a 20. Liu, K. ∙ Pan, X. ∙ Li, L. ... Binding and molecular basis of the bat coronavirus RaTG13 virus to ACE2 in humans and other species Cell. 2021; 184 :3438-3451.e3410 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wrobel et al., 2021 44.

Commun. 2021; 12 :837 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ). Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 variants and sarbecoviruses from pangolin have higher affinities for ACE2 than SARS-CoV, as do sarbecoviruses originating from civets and bats, which might be explained by the affinity-enhancing mutations present in these viruses ( Liu et al., 2021a 20. Liu, K. ∙ Pan, X. ∙ Li, L. ... Binding and molecular basis of the bat coronavirus RaTG13 virus to ACE2 in humans and other species Cell. 2021; 184 :3438-3451.e3410 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar ; Starr et al., 2020 34. Starr, T.N. ∙ Greaney, A.J. ∙ Hilton, S.K. ... Deep mutational scanning of SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain reveals constraints on folding and ACE2 binding Cell. 2020; 182 :1295-1310.e1220 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1190) PubMed Google Scholar ). An analysis of the conservation of protein sequence around the receptor binding sites of 25 reported sarbecovirus members relying on human ACE2 for cellular entry reveals that 11 residues of the virus out of a total of 21 residues that engage with the receptor are highly conserved ( Figure 6 E). The amino acids of the virus involved in binding ACE2 can be categorized into four groups based on their conservation and essential roles in binding: (1) group I includes six identical residues such as G447, Y453, N487, Y489, T500, and G502; (2) group II consists of five homologous residues like Y449/F/H, F456/L, Y473/F, F486/L, and Y505H; (3) group III has five conditionally altered residues like G446/S/T, L455/S/Y, A475/P/S, G476/D, and G496/S; and lastly, (4) group IV includes five highly diverse residues, K417/V/N/R/T, E484/K/P/Q/V/A, Q493/N/E/R/Y, Q498/Y/H/R, and N501/Y/T/D/S ( Figure 6 E). Mutations in the first two groups of amino acids are strictly constrained, presumably because they act as molecular determinants in either retaining basic affinity for ACE2 or ensuring proper protein folding, while substitutions in the last two groups of amino acids are, to some extent, tolerated or even enhance ACE2 binding and are frequently observed in various VOCs ( Figure 6 E). Of note, amino acids belonging to the group IV that dramatically affect affinity include residues at positions 417 (e.g., K417), 484 (e.g., K484), 493 (e.g., R493), 498 (e.g., R498), and 501 (e.g., Y501). These amino acids are also known to vary across sarbecoviruses. Furthermore, consensus mutations, including G446T/S, F456L, Y473F, and G476D are observed in low-affinity group (SARS-CoV and civet and bat sarbecoviruses), indicative of a concerted role for these mutations in regulating affinity for ACE2 ( Figure S6 ). In addition, the sequence and structural analysis revealed substantial plasticity in a complicated network formed by multiple substitutions, as some mutations probably increase polar contacts while others may impair hydrophobic interactions. Our results are largely supported by deep mutational scanning assays, unveiling the details of molecular interactions involved in ACE2 binding ( Figure S6 ) ( Starr et al., 2020 34. Starr, T.N. ∙ Greaney, A.J. ∙ Hilton, S.K. ... Deep mutational scanning of SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain reveals constraints on folding and ACE2 binding Cell. 2020; 182 :1295-1310.e1220 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1190) PubMed Google Scholar ).
In addition to the pursuit of greater transmissibility and infectivity, viral evolution is primarily driven by immune escape as well. Our immunogenic and mutational heatmaps for RBD using the 280 NAb complex structures to estimate in vivo NAb-targeting frequencies and viral mutation frequencies revealed an overall positive correlation between hot immunogenic sites and areas with high mutation frequencies, but with an exception for some sites involved in ACE2 binding ( Figure 6 E). Only three of the top ten hottest immunogenic residues contained substitutions (Q493R, E484K/A, and Y505H) in circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants, among which Q493R and Y505H are newly acquired in Omicron ( Figure 6 E). Particularly, hot immunogenic residues, such as F486, Y489, Y449, N487, and F456, are mostly from the groups I and II type of residues within ACE2 binding sites, and mutations at these positions have not yet been described among circulating variants ( Figure 6 E). In other words, substitutions of these hot immunogenic sites are best avoided because they probably sacrifice binding activity to ACE2, which could prove to be fatal to the virus. These correlates clearly explain why mutations at these positions would not be selected. In line with our findings, several ACE2-mimic antibodies have already been shown to broadly cross-neutralize sarbecoviruses ( Cameroni et al., 2021 4. Cameroni, E. ∙ Saliba, C. ∙ Bowen, J.E. ... Broadly neutralizing antibodies overcome SARS-CoV-2 Omicron antigenic shift Nature. 2021; Crossref Scopus (689) Google Scholar ; Park et al., 2021 30. Park, Y.-J. ∙ De Marco, A. ∙ Starr, T.N. ... Antibody-mediated broad sarbecovirus neutralization through ACE2 molecular mimicry Science. 2021; Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar ). The conserved and structurally constrained region for ACE2 recognition revealed in this study would rationalize the development of broad-spectrum vaccine and antibody therapeutics.
Cryo-EM structures of the Omicron S-trimer solved at serological and endosomal pH in this study reveal amino acid substitutions forging interactions that stably maintain an active conformation for receptor recognition. Future effort in determining the in situ structure of the Omicron virions could provide more insights into functional significance into these structural features. Moreover, the increased thermal stability of the Omicron S-trimer correlates with decreased fusogenicity, consistent with structural observations of more compact domain organization and newly established intersubunit interactions by amino acid substitutions. It will be important to further test the improved viral attachment and impaired viral fusion ability based on biochemical analysis with virological investigation approaches.

HEK293T and Huh-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The cultures were maintained at 37°C in an incubator supplied with 8% CO 2 .
The SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus was constructed as previously described using VSV pseudotyped virus (G ∗ ΔG-VSV) ( Nie et al., 2020 29. Nie, J. ∙ Li, Q. ∙ Wu, J. ... Establishment and validation of a pseudovirus neutralization assay for SARS-CoV-2 Emerg. Microbes Infect. 2020; 9 :680-686 Crossref Scopus (533) PubMed Google Scholar ). SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus carrying D614G, Omicron, and Omicron (R346K) mutations was constructed and used, as described previously ( Cao et al., 2021 6. Cao, Y.R. ∙ Wang, J. ∙ Jian, F. ... B. 1.1. 529 escapes the majority of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies of diverse epitopes bioRxiv. 2021; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). Omicron pseudovirus contains the following mutations: A67V, H69del, V70del, T95I, G142D, V143del, Y144del, Y145del, N211del, L212I, ins214EPE, G339D, S371L, S373P, S375F, K417N, N440K, G446S, S477N, T478K, E484A, Q493R, G496S, Q498R, N501Y, Y505H, T547K, D614G, H655Y, N679K, P681H, N764K, D796Y, N856K, Q954H, N969K, L981F.
The plasmids encoding the full-length spike (S) protein (residues 1-1028) of wild-type SARS-CoV-2 (GenBank: MN908947) was used as the template for the construction of the S gene of Delta (T19R, G142D, EF156-157del, R158G, L452R, T478K, D614G, P681R, D950N) and Omicron (A67V, Δ69-70, T95I, G142D, Δ143-145, Δ211, L212I, ins214EPE, G339D, S371L, S373P, S375F, K417N, N440K, G446S, S477N, T478K, E484A, Q493K, G496S, Q498R, N501Y, Y505H, T547K, D614G, H655Y, N679K, P681H, N764K, D796Y, N856K, Q954H, N969K, L981F) by overlapping PCR. All the S gene constructs have six proline substitutions at residues 817, 892, 899, 942, 986, and 987 and two alanine substitutions at residues 683 and 685 and a C-terminal T4 fibritin foldon domain to facilitate the protein expression and stabilization of the trimer conformation (ACROBiosystems, Cat No. SPN-C52Hz). All the constructs described above were attached with a C-terminal six-His for protein purification. To obtain these proteins, the plasmids constructed above were transiently transfected into HEK293 F cells grown in suspension at 37°C in a rotating, humidified incubator supplied with 8% CO 2 and maintained at 130 rpm. After incubation for 72 h, the supernatant was harvested, concentrated, and exchanged into the binding buffer by tangential flow filtration cassette. The protein of interest was separated by affinity chromatography using resin attached with Ni-NTA and subjected to additional purification by size exclusion chromatography using a Superose 6 10/300 column (GE Healthcare) in 20 mM Tris pH 7.5 and 200 mM NaCl.
PaSTRy was performed with SYPRO Orange (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA) as fluorescent probes to detect the exposed hydrophobic residues by an MX3005 qPCR instrument (Agilent, Santa Clara, USA). Here, we set up pH = 7.4 25 μL reaction system which contained 10 μg of target protein, i.e., S trimer of WT, Delta and Omicron, 1000x SYPRO Orange, and ramped up the temperature from 25°C to 99°C. Fluorescence was recorded in triplicate at an interval of 1°C.
Bio-layer interferometry ( BLI) experiments were run on an Octet Red 96e machine (Fortebio). To measure the binding affinities of RBD from different variants with ACE2, His-tagged WT RBD, Delta RBD or Omicron RBD were immobilized onto NTA biosensors (Fortebio) and three-fold serial dilutions of ACE2 were used as analytes. Also, the ACE2 was immobilized onto AR2G biosensors (Fortebio), as RBD of WT, Delta and Omicron as the analytes. Data were then recorded using software Data Acquisition 11.1 (Fortebio) and analyzed using software Data Analysis HT 11.1 (Fortebio) with a 1: 1 fitting model. After the Omicron RBD was loaded onto the NTA biosensor, the human ACE2 (or orthologs of other species) containing buffer solution was passed over the bound RBD. Repeated experiments yielded substantially lower affinities, some even returning negative results, whereas the WT RBD seemed to yield expected binding affinities with ACE2, indicative of the unsuitability of the use of Omicron RBD as immobilization phase. In addition, nonspecific binding of the Omicron RBD to AR2G biosensor was clearly detected when the amine-coupling ACE2 was immobilized onto AR2G biosensor in BLI assay, which also led to unreliable results. Thus, we chose SPR assay for binding affinity measurement.
ACE2 was immobilized onto CM5 sensor chips using a Biacore T100 (GE Healthcare). Serial dilutions of purified WT and Omicron RBD were injected, ranging in concentrations from 250 to 15.6 nM. The resulting data were fitted to a 1:1 binding model using Biacore Evaluation Software (GE Healthcare).
The pseudovirus neutralization assays were performed using Huh-7 cell lines, as described previously ( Cao et al., 2020 5. Cao, Y. ∙ Su, B. ∙ Guo, X. ... Potent Neutralizing Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 Identified by High-Throughput Single-Cell Sequencing of Convalescent Patients’ B Cells Cell. 2020; 182 :73-84.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (845) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, various concentrations of antibodies (5-fold serial dilution using DMEM) were mixed with the same volume of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus in a 96 well-plate. The mixture was incubated for 1 h at 37°C and supplied with 5% CO2. Next, pre-mixed Huh-7 cells were added to all wells, incubated for 24 h at 37°C supplied with 5% CO2. After incubation, the supernatants were removed, and D-luciferin reagents (Invitrogen) were added to each well. Luciferase activity was measured by using a microplate spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer EnSight). The inhibition rate is calculated by comparing the OD value to the negative and positive control wells. IC 50 was determined by a four-parameter logistic regression using GraphPad Prism 9.0.1 (GraphPad Software Inc.).
The WT, Delta, and Omicron S-trimer at 1 mg/mL were incubated with hACE2 at a ratio of 9 hACE2 molecules per S trimer overnight on ice. Samples were diluted to a concentration of 0.03 mg/mL before being imaged and negatively stained for EM. For trypsin treatment, samples were added with 1.6 μg/mL trypsin at room temperature for 15 min and used for imaging by negative staining EM.
The Delta S-trimer, Omicron S-trimer (at neutral or acidic pH), or Omicron S trimer (at neutral pH) mixed with hACE2 was dropped onto the pre-glow-discharged holey carbon-coated gold grid (C-flat, 300-mesh, 1.2/1.3, Protochips In.), blotted for 6 s with no force in 100% relative humidity and immediately plunged into the liquid ethane using Vitrobot (FEI). Cryo-EM datasets of these complexes were collected at 300 kV with an FEI Titan Krios microscope (FEI). Movies (32 frames, each 0.2 s, total dose of 60 e − Å -2 ) were recorded using a K3 Summit direct detector with a defocus range between 1.5- 2.5 μm. Automated single particle data acquisition was carried out by SerialEM, with a calibrated magnification of 22,500, yielding a final pixel size of 1.07 Å.
A total of 3,106, 1,777, 6,050, and 5,030 micrographs of Delta S-trimer, Omicron S-trimer under neutral and acidic pH conditions, and Omicron S-trimer mixed with hACE2 at pH 7.5 were recorded. All the micrographs were processed with MotionCor2 in Relion3.0. The CTF value of each micrograph was estimated by Gctf. Then 1,317,048, 830,943, 1,789,492 and 916,297 particles of Delta S-trimer, Omicron S-trimer under neutral and acidic pH conditions and neutral Omicron S-trimer mixed with hACE2 were picked and extracted by Relion3.0. Apo S and S-trimer-hACE2 complex were extracted with a 320 2 -pixel box and a 360 2 -pixel box, respectively. Reference-free 2D alignment by cryoSPARC ( Punjani et al., 2017 31. Punjani, A. ∙ Rubinstein, J.L. ∙ Fleet, D.J. ... cryoSPARC: algorithms for rapid unsupervised cryo-EM structure determination Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :290-296 Crossref Scopus (3664) PubMed Google Scholar ) was applied for all the particles. Based on the results of 2D alignment, 926,504 and 458,926 particles of Delta S-trimer and neutral Omicron S-trimer complexed with hACE2 were selected and applied for Heterogeneous Refinement by cryoSPARC. Then 309,137 and 479,164 particles of Omicron S-trimer under neutral and acidic pH were selected and applied for template-guided 3D-classification by Relion3.0 ( Zivanov et al., 2018 53. Zivanov, J. ∙ Nakane, T. ∙ Forsberg, B.O. ... New tools for automated high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination in RELION-3 elife. 2018; 7 :e42166 Crossref Scopus (2803) PubMed Google Scholar ). The 3D classification, using SARS-CoV-2 structure (zero-up) (EMD-21452) as initial model was performed. The results yielded only one configuration with one RBD up, apart from the rubbish class (∼10% particles). To excluded the existence of other conformations of Omicron S-trimer, a second round of 3D expansion using structures with zero-up (EMD-21452), one-up (EMD-21457), two-up (EMD-24127) or three up (EMD-30333) as references was carried out and only one up configuration was observed. For all the classifications, no symmetry was imposed. When the potential conformation for each structure was produced, particles from each candidate model were selected and processed by non-uniform auto-refinement and postprocessing in cryoSPARC to generate the final cryo-EM maps for Delta S-trimer, Omicron S-trimer under neutral and acidic pH conditions and Omicron S-trimer-hACE2 complex at pH 7.5. To improve the resolution of the interface between RBD and hACE2, the local refinement ( Wang et al., 2019 37. Wang, N. ∙ Zhao, D. ∙ Wang, J. ... Architecture of African swine fever virus and implications for viral assembly Science. 2019; 366 :640-644 Crossref Scopus (241) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yang et al., 2020 45. Yang, Y. ∙ Yang, P. ∙ Wang, N. ... Architecture of the herpesvirus genome-packaging complex and implications for DNA translocation Protein Cell. 2020; 11 :339-351 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used to obtain the final resolution of the focused interfaces, which contained the interfaces of RBD and hACE2 investigated here as described previously. The resolution was determined based on the gold-standard Fourier shell correlation (threshold = 0.143) and evaluated by ResMap ( Kucukelbir et al., 2014 16. Kucukelbir, A. ∙ Sigworth, F.J. ∙ Tagare, H.D. Quantifying the local resolution of cryo-EM density maps Nat. Methods. 2014; 11 :63-65 Crossref Scopus (1285) PubMed Google Scholar ). All dataset processing is shown in Figure. S2 and also summarized in Table S1 .
The atom models of the complexes were generated by first fitting the chains of native apo SARS-CoV-2 S trimer (PDB number of 6VYB) ( Walls et al., 2020 36. Walls, A.C. ∙ Park, Y.J. ∙ Tortorici, M.A. ... Structure, Function, and Antigenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein Cell. 2020; 181 :281-292.e286 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (5950) PubMed Google Scholar ) and ACE2 (PDB number of 6M0J) ( Lan et al., 2020 19. Lan, J. ∙ Ge, J. ∙ Yu, J. ... Structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain bound to the ACE2 receptor Nature. 2020; 581 :215-220 Crossref Scopus (4081) PubMed Google Scholar ) into the obtained cryo-EM densities by Chimera. Then the structure was manually adjusted and corrected according to the protein sequences and cryo-EM densities in Coot, and finally, real-space refinement was performed by Phenix. Details of the refinement statistics of the complexes are summarized in Table S1 .
Bio-layer interferometry assays, as well as surface plasmon resonance assays, were performed in triplicates. Neutralization assays were performed in biological triplicates.
