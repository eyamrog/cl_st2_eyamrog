Title: A Pathogen-Responsive Gene Cluster for Highly Modified Fatty Acids in Tomato


Abstract: Summary

In response to biotic stress, plants produce suites of highly modified fatty acids that bear unusual chemical functionalities. Despite their chemical complexity and proposed roles in pathogen defense, little is known about the biosynthesis of decorated fatty acids in plants. Falcarindiol is a prototypical acetylenic lipid present in carrot, tomato, and celery that inhibits growth of fungi and human cancer cell lines. Using a combination of untargeted metabolomics and RNA sequencing, we discovered a biosynthetic gene cluster in tomato ( Solanum lycopersicum ) required for falcarindiol production. By reconstituting initial biosynthetic steps in a heterologous host and generating transgenic pathway mutants in tomato, we demonstrate a direct role of the cluster in falcarindiol biosynthesis and resistance to fungal and bacterial pathogens in tomato leaves. This work reveals a mechanism by which plants sculpt their lipid pool in response to pathogens and provides critical insight into the complex biochemistry of alkynyl lipid production.

Section: Introduction

Modified lipids play a central role in plant defense ( Li-Beisson et al., 2013; Somerville and Browse, 1991 38. Li-Beisson, Y. ∙ Shorrosh, B. ∙ Beisson, F. ... Acyl-lipid metabolism Arabidopsis Book. 2013; 11 :e0161 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar 57. Somerville, C. ∙ Browse, J. Plant lipids: metabolism, mutants, and membranes Science. 1991; 252 :80-87 Crossref Scopus (382) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although structural lipids drawn from primary metabolism limit pathogen entry (e.g., extracellular cuticle), plants also reshape their complement of lipids in response to biotic stress to produce metabolites that function as signals or antimicrobial agents ( Lim et al., 2017 39. Lim, G.-H. ∙ Singhal, R. ∙ Kachroo, A. ... Fatty acid- and lipid-mediated signaling in plant defense Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 2017; 55 :505-536 Crossref Scopus (275) PubMed Google Scholar ). A notable example is jasmonic acid, a ubiquitous plant hormone and oxylipin biosynthesized inducibly from membrane-derived linolenic acid that undergoes enzymatic tailoring ( Blée, 2002; Wasternack, 2007 6. Blée, E. Impact of phyto-oxylipins in plant defense Trends Plant Sci. 2002; 7 :315-322 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (510) PubMed Google Scholar 62. Wasternack, C. Jasmonates: an update on biosynthesis, signal transduction and action in plant stress response, growth and development Ann. Bot. 2007; 100 :681-697 Crossref Scopus (1494) PubMed Google Scholar ). Acetylenic fatty acids are a related family of oxylipins present in seed oils or biosynthesized in response to pest and pathogen stress ( Konovalov, 2014; Minto and Blacklock, 2008 33. Konovalov, D.A. Polyacetylene compounds of plants of the Asteraceae family Pharm. Chem. J. 2014; 48 :613-631 Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar 43. Minto, R.E. ∙ Blacklock, B.J. Biosynthesis and function of polyacetylenes and allied natural products Prog. Lipid Res. 2008; 47 :233-306 Crossref Scopus (280) PubMed Google Scholar ). These compounds are highly modified lipids widely distributed throughout the plant kingdom, many of which include unique sets of desaturation, acetylenic functionality, and oxidation ( Figure 1 ; Buist, 2007 11. Buist, P.H. Exotic biomodification of fatty acids Nat. Prod. Rep. 2007; 24 :1110-1127 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Compared to other broad families of plant metabolites (e.g., alkaloids and terpenes; Wurtzel and Kutchan, 2016 63. Wurtzel, E.T. ∙ Kutchan, T.M. Plant metabolism, the diverse chemistry set of the future Science. 2016; 353 :1232-1236 Crossref Scopus (163) PubMed Google Scholar ), relatively little is known about the biosynthesis of highly modified fatty acids ( Napier, 2007 44. Napier, J.A. The production of unusual fatty acids in transgenic plants Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2007; 58 :295-319 Crossref Scopus (221) PubMed Google Scholar ), limiting our ability to take advantage of the biosynthetic capacity of plants to make valuable lipids through metabolic engineering ( Qi et al., 2004 49. Qi, B. ∙ Fraser, T. ∙ Mugford, S. ... Production of very long chain polyunsaturated omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids in plants Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22 :739-745 Crossref Scopus (385) PubMed Google Scholar ). As part of an effort to unravel the biosynthetic logic that governs the production of modified lipids, we chose to investigate the biosynthesis of falcarindiol, a representative oxylipin and odd-chain alkane found in edible plants that bears conjugated acetylenic functionality, oxidation, and an unusual terminal vinyl group ( Bentley et al., 1969; Christensen and Brandt, 2006 4. Bentley, R.K. ∙ Bhattacharjee, D. ∙ Jones, E.R.H. ... Natural acetylenes. Part XXVIII. C17-polyacetylenic alcohols from the Umbellifer Daucus carota L. (carrot): alkylation of benzene by acetylenyl(vinyl)carbinols in the presence of toluene-p-sulphonic acid J. Chem. Soc. C. 1969; 4 :685-688 Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar 15. Christensen, L.P. ∙ Brandt, K. Crozier, A. ∙ Clifford, M.N. ∙ Ashihara, H. (Editors) Plant Secondary Metabolites: Occurrence, Structure and Role in the Human Diet Blackwell Publishing, 2006; 137-164 Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar ). In addition to its chemical novelty, falcarindiol is a dietary metabolite with potent antifungal activity and cytotoxicity against several cancer cell lines ( Zidorn et al., 2005 65. Zidorn, C. ∙ Jöhrer, K. ∙ Ganzera, M. ... Polyacetylenes from the Apiaceae vegetables carrot, celery, fennel, parsley, and parsnip and their cytotoxic activities J. Agric. Food Chem. 2005; 53 :2518-2523 Crossref Scopus (221) PubMed Google Scholar ). Despite the demonstrated biological activity of falcarindiol and its presence in edible crops—it is abundant in carrot (6–60 mg/kg fresh weight in root tissue; Pferschy-Wenzig et al., 2009 48. Pferschy-Wenzig, E.-M. ∙ Getzinger, V. ∙ Kunert, O. ... Determination of falcarinol in carrot (Daucus carota L.) genotypes using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry Food Chem. 2009; 114 :1083-1090 Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar ) and ginseng root and induced by fungal pathogens in the leaves and fruit of tomato ( de Wit and Kodde, 1981 21. de Wit, P.J.G.M. ∙ Kodde, E. Induction of polyacetylenic phytoalexins in Lycopersicon esculentum after inoculation with Cladosporium fulvum (syn. Fulvia fulva) Physiol. Plant Pathol. 1981; 18 :143-148, IN145 Crossref Google Scholar )—no genes have been associated with the biosynthetic pathway. We predicted that the chemical modifications to the fatty acid backbone of falcarindiol likely involve a series of atypical transformations catalyzed by classical Fe-S desaturases and/or heme-containing oxidases that have evolved novel function ( Buist, 2004a 9. Buist, P.H. Fatty acid desaturases: selecting the dehydrogenation channel Nat. Prod. Rep. 2004; 21 :249-262 Crossref Scopus (100) PubMed Google Scholar ). Intriguingly, one such enzyme has been described in Crepis alpina ; Crep1 is a novel acetylenase that installs an alkyne in linoleic acid to generate crepenynic acid, which accumulates in the seed oil of this plant ( Lee et al., 1998 35. Lee, M. ∙ Lenman, M. ∙ Banaś, A. ... Identification of non-heme diiron proteins that catalyze triple bond and epoxy group formation Science. 1998; 280 :915-918 Crossref Scopus (211) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, no homolog in other plants has been associated with the biosynthesis of more highly modified lipids.

Section: Results

In order to uncover candidate genes in tomato for the biosynthesis of falcarindiol, we leveraged the observation that falcarindiol accumulation can be induced in tomato plants by biotic elicitors. Reasoning that temporal changes in metabolite levels would likely correlate with transcript levels of biosynthetic enzymes, we used a combination of untargeted metabolomics and RNA sequencing on paired samples of tomato leaf tissue challenged with biotic stress. To capture a wide range of pathway expression levels, we challenged tomato leaves with a diverse panel of microbial elicitors over a time course of 48 h (see Table S1 for the experimental design). We chose a set of elicitors that would likely invoke varied effects on pathway expression, including two microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs; fungal chitin and bacterial flagellin [i.e., Flg22]; Boutrot and Zipfel, 2017 8. Boutrot, F. ∙ Zipfel, C. Function, discovery, and exploitation of plant pattern recognition receptors for broad-spectrum disease resistance Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 2017; 55 :257-286 Crossref Scopus (463) PubMed Google Scholar ), two plant-associated pathogens ( Cladosporium fulvum and Xanthomonas euvesicatoria ), and three human-associated microbes ( Malassezia restricta , Staphylococcus epidermidis , and Propionibacterium acnes ), for a total of 7 treatments and two mock controls (for fungal and bacterial elicitors). We reasoned that adapted plant-associated microbes (microbes that have evolved with their natural hosts) and non-adapted microbes may elicit distinct and shared responses by the plant and would allow us to capture changes in the expression of a broad set of genes that contribute generally to defense and specifically to falcarindiol biosynthesis.
Quantitative metabolomic profiling using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis revealed significant and selective changes in metabolite levels, including falcarindiol, in response to elicitor type ( Figure S1 A), suggesting the utility of our dataset for pathway discovery. For example, falcarindiol production is reproducibly induced only by a subset of elicitation conditions ( Figure 2 A); C. fulvum , M. restricta , and S. epidermidis elicited tomato leaves 12, 24, and 48 h post-infiltration. In contrast, mass signatures corresponding to hydroxy cinnamic amides ( Facchini et al., 2002 22. Facchini, P.J. ∙ Hagel, J. ∙ Zulak, K.G. Hydroxycinnamic acid amide metabolism: physiology and biochemistry Can. J. Bot. 2002; 80 :577-589 Crossref Scopus (173) Google Scholar ) and compounds related to the sterol alkaloid tomatidine ( Itkin et al., 2013 30. Itkin, M. ∙ Heinig, U. ∙ Tzfadia, O. ... Biosynthesis of antinutritional alkaloids in solanaceous crops is mediated by clustered genes Science. 2013; 341 :175-179 Crossref Scopus (418) PubMed Google Scholar ) varied in abundance across the sample panel ( Figure S1 B) and are notably different from the patterns of falcarindiol accumulation. This suggested to us that metabolite-transcript correlation analysis for falcarindiol could help pinpoint candidate pathway genes that install the acetylenic functionality and provide a starting point for elucidating the genetic basis of the biosynthetic pathway.
Based on previous examples of plant fatty acid metabolic pathways and characterized acetylenases ( Cahoon et al., 2003; Buist, 2004b; Li-Beisson et al., 2013 10. Buist, P.H. Catalytic diversity of fatty acid desaturases Tetrahedron Asymmetry. 2004; 15 :2779-2785 Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar 13. Cahoon, E.B. ∙ Schnurr, J.A. ∙ Huffman, E.A. ... Fungal responsive fatty acid acetylenases occur widely in evolutionarily distant plant families Plant J. 2003; 34 :671-683 Crossref Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar 38. Li-Beisson, Y. ∙ Shorrosh, B. ∙ Beisson, F. ... Acyl-lipid metabolism Arabidopsis Book. 2013; 11 :e0161 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), we formulated a hypothesis for falcarindiol biosynthesis that involves many steps carried out by desaturases (for the proposed pathway, see Figure 3 ). We proposed that an early step in the pathway might involve conversion of linoleic acid to crepenynic acid via a Crep1-like acetylenase ( Lee et al., 1998 35. Lee, M. ∙ Lenman, M. ∙ Banaś, A. ... Identification of non-heme diiron proteins that catalyze triple bond and epoxy group formation Science. 1998; 280 :915-918 Crossref Scopus (211) PubMed Google Scholar ). Crep1 is one of the few enzymes known to be involved in modified fatty acid biosynthesis; therefore, we hypothesized that a related acetylenase in tomato is likely required for shunting fatty acids from primary metabolism into secondary metabolic pathways. Given that only a few amino acid changes distinguish acetylenases from other desaturases ( Buist, 2004a 9. Buist, P.H. Fatty acid desaturases: selecting the dehydrogenation channel Nat. Prod. Rep. 2004; 21 :249-262 Crossref Scopus (100) PubMed Google Scholar ), we could not identify a clear ortholog of Crep1 in tomato. Instead, we used a more general search for desaturases to generate a list of candidate acetylenases.
Of 59 unique desaturases predicted in the Heinz tomato genome ( The Tomato Genome Consortium, 2012 58. The Tomato Genome Consortium The tomato genome sequence provides insights into fleshy fruit evolution Nature. 2012; 485 :635-641 Crossref Scopus (2459) PubMed Google Scholar ; Heinz-SL2.50 version, Phytozome database), we detected 40 of the corresponding transcripts in our RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) dataset using a combination of BLAST and Pfam annotation based on the Arabidopsis thaliana proteome ( Table S2 A). We correlated the expression level of these transcripts with our LC-MS-based measurements of falcarindiol accumulation ( Figures 2 A and 2B) to prioritize the putative desaturases likely involved in the installation of the falcarindiol alkynes. Unexpectedly, we noted that, of the six genes whose expression levels correlated best with falcarindiol accumulation (based on the R value from the linear regression analysis, cutoff value > 0.2; Table S2 B), four were located sequentially on chromosome 12 in the same 20-kb region of the genome ( Figure 2 C, Solyc12g100240-Solyc12g100270) and were highly co-expressed ( Table S2 C). Three of the genes are annotated as desaturases and the fourth as a decarbonylase, suggesting that this locus encodes a cluster of enzymes associated with fatty acid metabolism. The presence of a decarbonylase was notable, given that falcarindiol lacks the carboxylic acid typical of a fatty acid. Biosynthetic gene clusters have been reported for production of many classes of plant metabolites ( Nützmann et al., 2016 45. Nützmann, H.W. ∙ Huang, A. ∙ Osbourn, A. Plant metabolic clusters - from genetics to genomics New Phytol. 2016; 211 :771-789 Crossref Scopus (229) PubMed Google Scholar ), but only one has been reported previously for production of a polyketide ( Hen-Avivi et al., 2016; Schneider et al., 2016 27. Hen-Avivi, S. ∙ Savin, O. ∙ Racovita, R.C. ... A metabolic gene cluster in the wheat W1 and the barley Cer-cqu loci determines β-diketone biosynthesis and glaucousness Plant Cell. 2016; 28 :1440-1460 Crossref Scopus (117) PubMed Google Scholar 54. Schneider, L.M. ∙ Adamski, N.M. ∙ Christensen, C.E. ...

Bot. 2016; 67 :2715-2730 Crossref Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Two of the candidate genes in the cluster, Solyc12g100240 and Solyc12g100260, have overlapping identical sequences ( Figure S2 ), and each appears to encode a partial desaturase (∼150 nt). Further inspection of the Heinz genome in this region revealed that the assembly is incomplete and is missing the DNA sequence surrounding the predicted Solyc12g100240 and Solyc12g100260 genes. Our VF36 RNA-seq data mapped to this region and the short reads for Solyc12g100240 and Solyc12g100260 were nearly identical, with only 2 nt differences. To obtain full-length sequences for the putative desaturases, we performed de novo assembly of our VF36 data to determine whether there was a complete transcript(s) that contained Solyc12g100240- and Solyc12g100260-like sequences. This analysis resulted in a single, full-length desaturase transcript consisting of 1 exon (1,140 nt, referred to as 240/260 cDNA) that contains both the Solyc12g100240 and Solyc12g100260 sequences ( Figure S2 ). The 240/260 transcript is predicted to encode a 43.9-kDa full-length protein characteristic of a typical desaturase. An identical transcript was detected in a Heinz cDNA library, corroborating the gene sequence assignment; notably, the short RNA-seq reads used to enumerate expression of Solyc12g100240 and Solyc12g100260 mapped to the 3′ end of the larger 240/260 transcript. Given the nearly identical sequence of the Solyc12g100240 and Solyc12g100260 partial genes, it was unclear whether the 240/260 assembled transcript represented a single gene or two separate genes in the tomato genome.
To better resolve whether there are one or two desaturases within the gene cluster, we performed Nanopore DNA sequencing of VF36 tomato DNA to generate long reads spanning the proposed Solyc12g100230-Solyc12g10070 locus. These sequencing data confirm the existence of a gene cluster comprised of four genes ( Figure 2 C; Figure S2 A), which includes separate full-length sequences for Solyc12g100240 and Solyc12g100260. Sanger sequencing of PCR products using primers sets flanking Solyc12g100240 and Solyc12g100260 were used to differentiate the two gene sequences and definitively map them in the gene cluster ( Figure S2 A). Notably, the two genes differ by two nucleotides ( Figure S2 B) but encode an identical protein. Collectively, our analysis indicates that the gene cluster encodes three putative desaturases and one putative decarbonylase.
In order to determine whether Solyc12g100240 and Solyc12g100260 possess acetylenase activity, we overexpressed the 240/260 cDNA in Nicotiana benthamiana using Agrobacterium -mediated transient expression. Three days post-infiltration, N. benthamiana leaves were collected, and saponified methanol extracts were analyzed by LC-MS for accumulation of crepenynic acid. The m/z value for the crepenynic acid proton adduct was only detected in N. benthamiana tissue expressing the 240/260 cDNA ( Figure 4 ; Figure S2 B). The adduct exhibited the same retention time as the control product from Crep1 expression ( Figure S3 A), and the presence of an alkyne was supported by chemical derivatization of the alkyne using ruthenium-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition click chemistry ( Figures S3 C, S3D, and S4 ; Boren et al., 2008 7. Boren, B.C. ∙ Narayan, S. ∙ Rasmussen, L.K. ... Ruthenium-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition: scope and mechanism J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2008; 130 :8923-8930 Crossref Scopus (727) PubMed Google Scholar ). These data indicate that Solyc12g100240 and Solyc12g100260 (renamed ACETYLENASE1 or ACET1 ; ACET1a and ACET1b , respectively) encode an identical acetylenase that converts linoleic acid to crepenynic acid, suggesting that it catalyzes the first step in the falcarindiol pathway in tomato. Remarkably, reverse correlation analysis using ACET1a gene expression as bait against the collection of all metabolites detected in tomato leaf extracts after elicitation revealed falcarindiol among the metabolites whose production are most correlated with ACET1a expression ( Table S3 ). This analysis highlights the power of untargeted correlation of gene expression to metabolite production for pathway discovery and corroborates the proposed role of ACET1a and ACET1b in falcarindiol biosynthesis.
Further inspection of the gene cluster suggested that, in addition to ACET1a and ACET1b , Solyc12g100250 and Solyc12g100270 might be involved in falcarindiol biosynthesis. Not only are their annotated enzymatic activities consistent with the proposed biosynthetic pathway (e.g., further desaturation and decarbonylation), but Solyc12g100250 and Solyc12g100270 are the genes whose expression levels correlate best with ACET1a and ACET1b expression ( Table S2 C). To test a role for these genes in falcarindiol biosynthesis, we transiently co-expressed each with the 240/260 cDNA using Agrobacterium -mediated expression in N. benthamiana to identify potential modified fatty acid metabolites representing downstream intermediates in the pathway. Untargeted metabolite analysis in leaves expressing both Solyc12g100250 and 240/260 cDNA revealed depletion of crepenynic acid and accumulation of two new mass signatures whose formulae correspond to octadecene-diynoic acid and a compound with an additional desaturation, octadecadiene-diynoic acid ( Figure 4 ; Figure S4 A). Although we have not been able to confirm the proposed structures illustrated in Figure 4 using authentic standards, MS/MS analysis and derivatization of the alkyne using the aforementioned click chemistry ( Figures S3 C, S3D, and S4 ) suggest that they are modified fatty acids that contain acetylenic functionality. These data provide biochemical evidence that Solyc12g100250 encodes a desaturase that can use crepenynic acid as a substrate. We also examined the predicted protein sequence of Solyc12g100250, ACET1a, and ACET1b in light of recent identification of key residues in the plant FAD2-like desaturase family that correlate ( Busta et al., 2018 12. Busta, L. ∙ Yim, W.C. ∙ LaBrant, E.W. ... Identification of genes encoding enzymes catalyzing the early steps of carrot polyacetylene biosynthesis Plant Physiol. 2018; 178 :1507-1521 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ) with divergent (e.g., acetylenase) function and found that, although ACET1a and ACET1b harbored residues in common with known acetylenases at these key positions, Solyc12g100250 exhibited an unusual hybrid pattern, with some key residues in this protein similar to traditional desaturases and others similar to known acetylenases ( Figure S5 ), a result consistent with our tentative attribution of both activities to this protein. It is unclear whether Solyc12g100250 is responsible for multiple steps or functions with ACET1a and ACET1b to produce the detected molecules.
Solyc12g100270 is one of five tomato homologs of CER1, a fatty acid decarbonylase in A. thaliana that functions with its partner enzyme CER3 to catalyze very long-chain fatty acid decarboxylation to produce an alkane in wax biosynthesis ( Bernard et al., 2012 5. Bernard, A. ∙ Domergue, F. ∙ Pascal, S. ... Reconstitution of plant alkane biosynthesis in yeast demonstrates that Arabidopsis ECERIFERUM1 and ECERIFERUM3 are core components of a very-long-chain alkane synthesis complex Plant Cell. 2012; 24 :3106-3118 Crossref Scopus (339) PubMed Google Scholar ). Notably, the CER1/CER3 pair provides a precedent for a biosynthetic route to modified plant lipids with odd chain lengths. Given that Solyc12g100270 is homologous to CER1, we hypothesized that this enzyme might convert the carboxylic acid of a falcarindiol precursor to the alkane terminus, which is a signature of this modified fatty acid ( Figure 3 ). However, transient expression of Solyc12g100270 with or without Solyc12g100250, 240/260 cDNA, and A. thaliana CER3 in N. benthamiana did not lead to production of a new metabolite. It is possible that Solyc12g100270 is not expressed in an active form in N. benthamiana , is missing a partner protein, or acts further downstream in the pathway.
As an alternative approach to study the role of Solyc12g100270, we tested directly whether this gene is required for falcarindiol production using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing in tomato ( Liu et al., 2017 40. Liu, H. ∙ Ding, Y. ∙ Zhou, Y. ... CRISPR-P 2.0: an improved CRISPR-Cas9 tool for genome editing in plants Mol. Plant. 2017; 10 :530-532 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (452) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, we targeted ACET1a and ACET1b to validate the first step in the pathway. Multiple knockout mutants (designated ΔACET1 and Δ270) were generated in the tomato VF36 background ( Figure 5 A; Figure S6 ). We were able to generate a mutant line that has both ACET1a and ACET1b loci mutated and refer to it as Δ ACET1 ( Figure S6 B). Untargeted metabolite analysis of tomato leaf extracts from WT and multiple independent ΔACET1 and Δ270 mutant lines treated with C. fulvum revealed that falcarindiol is among three major metabolites present in the wild type (WT) but absent in both biosynthetic mutants ( Figure 5 B; Figure S6 ). The proposed formulae for the other two mass signatures are consistent with modified fatty acid scaffolds, although we have not yet been able to confirm their chemical structures ( Figure S6 F). These data corroborate the biochemical activity observed for ACET1 in N. benthamiana and indicate that ACET1a , ACET1b , and Solyc12g100270 are required for production of falcarindiol in tomato.
Next we performed transient genetic complementation tests for the tomato ΔACET1 and Δ270 mutants to provide additional evidence that these genes are involved in falcarindiol biosynthesis. We had observed that elicitation of tomato leaves with A. tumefaciens strain 1D1249 is sufficient to induce the falcarindiol biosynthetic pathway ( Figure 5 C); therefore, we reasoned that Agrobacterium- mediated transient overexpression of cDNAs for ACET1 and Solyc12g100270 could induce the pathway and also provide an enzyme to complement the protein defect present in biosynthetic mutants. We observed that transient expression of Solyc12g100270 cDNA in Δ270 mutant leaves restores falcarindiol production ( Figure 5 C), supporting a direct role of this putative decarbonylase in the biosynthetic pathway. In contrast, overexpression of ACET1 cDNA did not complement falcarindiol production in the ΔACET1 mutants. Considering that ACET1a and ACET1b catalyze an early step in the pathway and are co-localized in the gene cluster, it is possible that expression of downstream genes may be disrupted or that coordinated regulation of pathway genes may be lost in the ΔACET1 mutant.
Taken together, our analysis of ΔACET1 and Δ270 mutants provides direct support for involvement of these genes in the synthesis of falcarindiol. Encouraged by these results and the utility of these mutant lines in the pathogen analysis described below, we subsequently generated tomato lines mutated in Solyc12g100250 to further explore the function of this unusual desaturase in planta . Metabolite analysis of tomato leaf extracts from the WT and Δ250 mutants elicited with A. tumefaciens strain 1D1249 revealed that falcarindiol is present in the WT and significantly reduced but not eliminated in Δ250 mutants ( Figure 5 D). We also tested elicitation with a different strain, A. tumefaciens strain C58C1, which induces higher production of falcarindiol in WT leaves. With this heightened elicitation condition, we observed that production of falcarindiol in C58C1-elicited Δ250 leaves is reduced, on average, 88% compared with similarly elicited WT leaves ( Figure 5 D). These studies demonstrate that Solyc12g100250 has a direct role in the synthesis of falcarindiol after microbial elicitation. The observation that low levels of falcarindiol are still produced in the Δ250 mutants suggests that another enzyme with similar activity exists in the tomato genome. Collectively, our analysis of ΔACET1 and Δ270 mutants, combined with the metabolite profiling of Δ250, further supports a coordinated role of this co-localized set of enzymes in the biosynthesis of modified fatty acids.
To assess the contribution of the gene cluster to basal tomato immune responses, we measured the ability of virulent tomato pathogens (a fungus and two bacterial strains) to infect and replicate in WT and mutant leaves. First, we examined the Δ ACET1 and Δ270 mutant lines deficient in falcarindiol production for their resistance against the necrotrophic fungus Botrytis cinerea strain B05.10. We chose this pathogen based on prior work in carrots, which showed that falcarindiol inhibits Botrytis cinerea growth ( Harding and Heale, 1980 26. Harding, V. ∙ Heale, J. Isolation and identification of the antifungal compounds accumulating in the induced resistance response of carrot root slices to Botrytis cinerea Physiol. Plant Pathol. 1980; 17 :277-289 Crossref Google Scholar ). Spores of the B. cinerea strain were applied to the surface of tomato leaves, and then infection was evaluated 3 days later by measuring lesion size and fungal biomass. Unexpectedly, lesion size and fungal biomass were significantly reduced in Δ ACET1 and Δ270 mutant leaves compared with WT leaves ( Figures 6 A–6C, S6 A, and S6B). These results indicate that disruption of modified fatty acid biosynthesis associated with falcarindiol production in these mutants leads to enhanced resistance to B. cinerea rather than enhanced susceptibility.
To further explore whether this increased resistance phenotype observed for our tomato mutants is specific to Botrytis infection or extends to other pathogens, we next examined the susceptibility of the tomato gene cluster mutants to adapted bacterial pathogens of tomato. We chose two virulent bacterial strains, Xanthomonas euvesicatoria strain 85-10 and Pseudomonas syringae pathovar tomato strain DC3000 (Pst DC3000), the causal agents of bacterial spot and speck disease, respectively, and examined their growth in the leaves of WT plants and the Δ ACET1 , Δ250, and Δ270 mutant lines. Bacterial titers were not significantly different in infected leaves of Δ ACET1 , Δ250, or Δ270 compared with those of the WT ( Figures S7 A and S7B). In addition, bacterial strains lacking the type III secretion system (Xe 85-10 ΔhrcV and Pst ΔhrcU ), which are attenuated in virulence, grew similarly in WT and mutant tomato leaves ( Figures S7 C and S7D), indicating that mutation of ΔACET1 , Δ250, or Δ270 does not affect basal tomato immune responses that inhibit bacterial growth.
Given that pathogens deploy virulence factors to interfere with antimicrobial defenses, we investigated the possibility that effector proteins delivered by these bacterial pathogens into tomato cells by the type III secretion system may modulate the expression of the gene cluster to increase pathogenesis. We found RNA-seq evidence in the literature that two effectors from Pst DC3000, AvrPto and AvrPtoB, known to suppress basal defense responses ( Abramovitch and Martin, 2005; de Torres et al., 2006 1. Abramovitch, R.B. ∙ Martin, G.B. AvrPtoB: a bacterial type III effector that both elicits and suppresses programmed cell death associated with plant immunity FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2005; 245 :1-8 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar 20. de Torres, M. ∙ Mansfield, J.W. ∙ Grabov, N. ... Pseudomonas syringae effector AvrPtoB suppresses basal defence in Arabidopsis Plant J. 2006; 47 :368-382 Crossref Scopus (132) PubMed Google Scholar ) affect the transcription of this gene cluster in elicited tomato leaves ( Rosli et al., 2013 51. Rosli, H.G. ∙ Zheng, Y. ∙ Pombo, M.A. ... Transcriptomics-based screen for genes induced by flagellin and repressed by pathogen effectors identifies a cell wall-associated kinase involved in plant immunity Genome Biol. 2013; 14 :R139 Crossref Scopus (118) PubMed Google Scholar ). By performing qPCR, we confirmed that the abundance of mRNAs for ACET1a/ACET1b , Solyc12g100250, and Solyc12g100270 was significantly higher in WT tomato leaves infected with a Pst DC3000 strain lacking AvrPto and AvrPtoB (Δ avrPtoΔavrPtoB ) compared with WT tomato leaves infected with Pst D3000 ( Figure S7 E). Therefore, we tested whether growth of the Δ avrPtoΔavrPtoB strain was different than WT Pst DC3000 in any of the tomato gene cluster mutants. We found that the titer of Δ avrPtoΔavrPtoB was significantly lower in infected tomato leaves from all three gene cluster mutants 4 days post-infection (dpi) compared with similarly infected WT leaves ( Figure 6 D). These data reveal that the gene cluster mutant lines are more resistant to Pst DC3000 lacking AvrPto and AvrPtoB, suggesting that these virulence factors directly or indirectly interfere with modified fatty acid biosynthesis during Pst DC3000 infection. Together, these data show that the tomato gene cluster associated with the production of unusual fatty acids, including falcarindiol, is generally involved in both bacterial and fungal interactions in tomato.

Section: Discussion

Computational identification of gene clusters in bacteria have drastically accelerated pathway discovery (>1,000 complete pathways are known to date; Cimermancic et al., 2014 17. Cimermancic, P. ∙ Medema, M.H. ∙ Claesen, J. ... Insights into secondary metabolism from a global analysis of prokaryotic biosynthetic gene clusters Cell. 2014; 158 :412-421 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (678) PubMed Google Scholar ). In plants, the phenomenon of gene clustering is just beginning to be understood, with ∼30 gene clusters described to date for several types of plant-specialized metabolites ( Nützmann et al., 2016 45. Nützmann, H.W. ∙ Huang, A. ∙ Osbourn, A. Plant metabolic clusters - from genetics to genomics New Phytol. 2016; 211 :771-789 Crossref Scopus (229) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our discovery of co-localized genes required for falcarindiol biosynthesis indicates that the phenomenon of gene clustering may also extend to the biosynthesis of highly modified fatty acids. In our approach to pathway discovery, we highlight the power of untargeted correlation of gene expression to metabolite production to accelerate the discovery of biosynthetic enzymes even when no genes from the pathway are known and no large-scale genetic resources in the native producing plant are available. Notably, we observed that the falcarindiol pathway is only activated in tomato in the presence of specific pathogens, reminiscent of the “microbial dark matter” of the bacterial world ( Marcy et al., 2007; Rutledge and Challis, 2015 41. Marcy, Y. ∙ Ouverney, C. ∙ Bik, E.M. ... Dissecting biological “dark matter” with single-cell genetic analysis of rare and uncultivated TM7 microbes from the human mouth Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104 :11889-11894 Crossref Scopus (504) PubMed Google Scholar 52. Rutledge, P.J. ∙ Challis, G.L. Discovery of microbial natural products by activation of silent biosynthetic gene clusters Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2015; 13 :509-523 Crossref Scopus (681) PubMed Google Scholar ), an observation that indicates that transcriptome and metabolite analyses under a wide variety of stresses are critical to capture the vast potential of plant biosynthesis.
The role of desaturation in decoration of fatty acids has been associated with changes in membrane fluidity because of alternative structural conformation as well as melting temperature differences imparted by this functionality ( Upchurch, 2008 60. Upchurch, R.G. Fatty acid unsaturation, mobilization, and regulation in the response of plants to stress Biotechnol. Lett. 2008; 30 :967-977 Crossref Scopus (697) PubMed Google Scholar ), and the presence of multiple acetylenes adds yet another layer of lipid structural tuning that could modify the chemical properties these metabolites. Although the biological role of the various chemical modifications on these unusual lipids remains elusive, our work provides new biochemical insights into the metabolic pathways that modify lipids and greatly expands our knowledge of the unusual enzymology that governs their biosynthesis. ACET1a/b, Solyc12g100250, and Solyc12g100270 are predicted to be part of a larger family of non-heme di-iron enzymes that include typical desaturases that catalyze selective removal of an equivalent of hydrogen from a fatty acid backbone. Similar to the previously characterized acetylenase Crep1, these enzymes appear to have evolved non-canonical function for fatty acid modification.
Falcarindiol was initially shown to be present in healthy tissue of plants in the Apiaceae family, including Falcaria vulgaris (sickleweed), Daucus carota (wild carrot), and Aegopodium podagraria (ground elder) ( Minto and Blacklock, 2008; Bentley et al., 1969 4. Bentley, R.K. ∙ Bhattacharjee, D. ∙ Jones, E.R.H. ... Natural acetylenes. Part XXVIII. C17-polyacetylenic alcohols from the Umbellifer Daucus carota L. (carrot): alkylation of benzene by acetylenyl(vinyl)carbinols in the presence of toluene-p-sulphonic acid J. Chem. Soc. C. 1969; 4 :685-688 Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar 43. Minto, R.E. ∙ Blacklock, B.J. Biosynthesis and function of polyacetylenes and allied natural products Prog. Lipid Res. 2008; 47 :233-306 Crossref Scopus (280) PubMed Google Scholar ). Subsequent work showed that solanaceous plants do not normally produce acetylenes like falcarindiol. Production in tomato leaves and fruits, however, could be stimulated by infection with the leaf mold Cladosporium fulvum ( de Wit and Kodde, 1981 21. de Wit, P.J.G.M. ∙ Kodde, E. Induction of polyacetylenic phytoalexins in Lycopersicon esculentum after inoculation with Cladosporium fulvum (syn. Fulvia fulva) Physiol. Plant Pathol. 1981; 18 :143-148, IN145 Crossref Google Scholar ). Our metabolite profiling, using a panel of microbial elicitors, further demonstrates that biosynthesis of falcarindiol must be induced in tomato and reveals that both fungal and bacterial strains can induce falcarindiol production, although the levels vary ( Figure 2 A). C. fulvum (race 5), a tomato-associated fungal strain that induces a very strong immune response in VF36 tomato leaves, elicited the highest falcarindiol levels in our study ( Figure 2 A). Interestingly, falcarindiol was detected in tomato leaves elicited with human-associated fungal ( M. restricta ) and bacterial strains ( P. acnes and S. epidermidis ) ( Figure 2 A). We surmise that production of falcarindiol in response to these microbes may be a non-host defense response, given that they do not colonize tomato plants. In contrast, the bacterial strain X. euvesicatoria 85-10 did not trigger falcarindiol accumulation. Given that this bacterium is highly virulent on VF36 tomato leaves, we speculate that it may have evolved mechanisms to modulate the activity of the gene cluster. Although we have not yet obtained evidence of X. euvesicatoria manipulation of falcarindiol production, we have discovered that the action of two Pst DC3000 effectors, AvrPto and AvrPtoB, in tomato leaf cells reduces the mRNA abundance for genes in the cluster ( Figure S7 E).
Falcarindiol’s role in defense emerged following reports that falcarindiol levels increase in B. cinerea -infected carrots and that ethanol extracts from the infected tissue inhibit germination of B. cinerea spores ( Harding and Heale, 1980 26. Harding, V. ∙ Heale, J. Isolation and identification of the antifungal compounds accumulating in the induced resistance response of carrot root slices to Botrytis cinerea Physiol. Plant Pathol. 1980; 17 :277-289 Crossref Google Scholar ). Bioassays with falcarindiol obtained from C. fulvum -infected tomato leaves also inhibited mycelial growth ( de Wit and Kodde, 1981 21. de Wit, P.J.G.M. ∙ Kodde, E. Induction of polyacetylenic phytoalexins in Lycopersicon esculentum after inoculation with Cladosporium fulvum (syn. Fulvia fulva) Physiol. Plant Pathol. 1981; 18 :143-148, IN145 Crossref Google Scholar ), confirming its reported antifungal bioactivity. Whether falcarindiol is required to restrict fungal growth during plant infection has remained elusive. Intriguingly, analysis of the Δ ACET1 and Δ270 mutant tomato lines, which do not produce falcarindiol ( Figure 5 ), showed that they are more resistant to B. cinerea ( Figure 6 ). One interpretation of these findings is that other metabolites also produced by ACET1a/b and Solyc12g100270 may play a role in fungal infection. Along these lines, we found that the levels of metabolites putatively related to falcarindiol also change in these gene mutants ( Figure S6 F). Alternatively, mutation of these enzymes may lead to accumulation of stalled intermediates with potent antifungal activity.
Although our results point to the importance of highly modified fatty acids in tomato-pathogen interactions, the precise role of these compounds is unclear. There is compelling evidence that plant oxylipins produced by the lipoxygenase (LOX) pathway function in both defense and fungal development. For example, disruption of oxylipin produced by the 9-LOX pathway in maize increased resistance to Fusarium verticillioides ( Gao et al., 2007 23. Gao, X. ∙ Shim, W.B. ∙ Göbel, C. ... Disruption of a maize 9-lipoxygenase results in increased resistance to fungal pathogens and reduced levels of contamination with mycotoxin fumonisin Mol. Plant Microbe Interact. 2007; 20 :922-933 Crossref Scopus (158) PubMed Google Scholar ). Fungal conidiation and toxin production were reduced on lox mutant kernels. This study provided compelling evidence that host oxylipid metabolism is required for successful colonization by certain fungal pathogens. It also supported the idea of lipid-mediated cross-kingdom communication between plant hosts and pathogens ( Christensen and Kolomiets, 2011 16. Christensen, S.A. ∙ Kolomiets, M.V. The lipid language of plant-fungal interactions Fungal Genet. Biol. 2011; 48 :4-14 Crossref Scopus (168) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our studies investigating B. cinerea pathogenesis in tomato highlight the functional importance of this highly modified fatty acid pathway in the outcome of plant-fungal interactions. Whether acetylenic derivatives produced by genes in this cluster are involved in plant-fungal communication is an exciting avenue for future research. Furthermore, the similar phenotypes observed in tomato gene cluster mutants with PstDC3000 ΔavrPtoΔavrPtoB attenuated in virulence could be explained by a common mechanism of action for gene cluster products.
Analysis of the Δ250 tomato mutants revealed that Solyc12g100250 is a major, but not the sole, desaturase producing modified fatty acids used in falcarindiol biosynthesis ( Figure 5 D). A putative desaturase (Solyc12g049030) sharing the highest similarity (∼70%) with Solyc12g100250 is predicted to reside on the same chromosome at a distance from the gene cluster. Interestingly, the co-expression profile of Solyc12g049030 in elicitor-treated leaves mirrors that of Solyc12g100250 as well as those of the other genes in the cluster ( Table S2 B), suggesting that Solyc12g04930 may coordinatively act in the synthesis of highly modified fatty acids.
Many of the >1,400 different acetylenic lipids found in plants are confined to approximately 24 families of higher plants from the Solanales and Apiales orders ( Minto and Blacklock, 2008 43. Minto, R.E. ∙ Blacklock, B.J. Biosynthesis and function of polyacetylenes and allied natural products Prog. Lipid Res. 2008; 47 :233-306 Crossref Scopus (280) PubMed Google Scholar ). Using the three genes we connected with falcarindiol biosynthesis in tomato, we investigated whether this gene cluster is conserved among other falcarindiol producers ( Figure 7 ). Sequence homology indicates high sequence similarity for similar collections of colocalized genes (>80%–90% sequence ID at the protein level) in several species of Solanaceae, including S. pennellii (wild tomato), S. tuberosum (cultivated potato), and Capsicum annuum (bell pepper). Notably, none of these plants have been reported to accumulate falcarindiol. Given that falcarindiol accumulates in tomato leaves only under pathogen elicitation, it is possible that other species, such as potato, have the capacity to also produce acetylenic lipids but only under specific elicitation conditions. Few genomes from the best-known acetylenic fatty acid producers of the Apiales order, including parsley, ginseng, and celery, have been sequenced, with the exception of carrot ( Iorizzo et al., 2016 29. Iorizzo, M. ∙ Ellison, S. ∙ Senalik, D. ... A high-quality carrot genome assembly provides new insights into carotenoid accumulation and asterid genome evolution Nat. Genet. 2016; 48 :657-666 Crossref Scopus (372) PubMed Google Scholar ). In Daucus carota , there are distant orthologs of ACET1 and Solyc12g100250; however, the relatively low sequence identity (<60%–70%) at the protein level and lack of gene clustering make it difficult to predict whether these genes are likely involved in falcarindiol biosynthesis or whether the pathway has arisen in carrot through convergent evolution.
Our work provides direct biochemical and genetic evidence of the involvement of three core enzymes encoded in a novel cluster of metabolic genes that coordinately act in the biosynthesis of falcarindiol and opens the door for mapping the rich chemistry and biology of highly functionalized oxylipins in plants produced in response to microbial elicitation.

Tomato ( Solanum lycopersicum ) plants cultivars VF36 and Heinz 1706 were grown in a greenhouse (16h light, 25-28°C). Nicotiana benthamiana plants were grown in a growth chamber (16h light, 25°C). For experiments, 4-6 week-old tomato and 6-8 week-old N. benthamiana plants were used.
Malassezia restricta (obtained from L’Oreal) was grown at 30°C on modified Dixon agar (ATCC medium: 2693). Cladosporium fulvum race 5 (obtained from Ioannis Stergiopoulos, UC Davis) was grown at 23°C on 0.5X potato dextrose agar ( de Wit and Kodde, 1981 21. de Wit, P.J.G.M. ∙ Kodde, E.

Plant Pathol. 1981; 18 :143-148, IN145 Crossref Google Scholar ). Staphylococcus epidermidis (obtained from L’Oreal) was grown at 37°C on CASO (Casein-peptone Soymeal-peptone) agar. Propionibacterium acnes (obtained from L’Oreal) was grown at 37°C on modified reinforced Clostridial agar (ATCC medium: 2107). Xanthomonas euvesicatoria strain 85-10 (WT and ΔhrcV ) and Pseudomonas syringae pathovar tomato strain DC3000 (WT, ΔhrcU, ΔavrPtoΔavrPtoB (obtained from Gregory Martin, Cornell University)) were grown at 28°C on nutrient yeast glycerol agar ( Turner et al., 1984 59. Turner, P. ∙ Barber, C. ∙ Daniels, M. Behaviour of the transposons Tn5 and Tn7 in Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 195 :101-107 Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar ) media containing 100 μg/mL rifampicin. Agrobacterium tumefaciens strains GV3101, LBA4404, and C58C1 were grown at 28°C on Luria agar with antibiotics (50 μg/mL gentamicin + 100 μg/mL rifampicin, 100 μg/mL rifampicin, and 5 μg/mL tetracycline + 100 μg/mL rifampicin, respectively) and strain 1D1249 (obtained from Richard Michelmore, UC Davis) was grown at 28°C on YEP (yeast extract peptone) agar with antibiotics (50 μg/mL kanamycin). For inoculation, water ( M. restricta, C. fulvum, S. epidermidis, and P. acnes ) or 10mM MgCl 2 ( X. euvesicatoria ) or Agrobacterium induction media ( A. tumefaciens ) was added to the plates to suspend spores or microbes.
Leaflets of tomato VF36 plants were hand-inoculated using a needleless 1 mL syringe with: 1) fungal elicitors: chitin (0.5 mg/mL in water), M. restricta (OD 600 = 0.5 in water) or C. fulvum (OD 600 = 1.0 in water); 2) bacterial elicitors: flg22 (1 μM in water), S. epidermidis (OD 600 = 1.0 in water), P. acnes (OD 600 = 1.0 in water) or X. euvesicatoria (OD 600 = 0.2 in 10mM MgCl 2 ); or 3) mock (water, control) (Figure S1). After treatment, leaves (one leaf from three individual plants per treatment, n = 3) were collected at 12, 24, and 48 hours post-inoculation (hpi) using a razor, flash frozen by liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 ° C for later use in metabolomics analysis, gene profiling and RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq).
A multiplexed RNA-Seq cDNA library was prepared from RNA isolated from the elicited tomato leaves (two biological replicates for each treatment per time point, 54 samples total) using the NEBNext mRNA Library Prep Master Mix Set for Illumina and then PCR amplified using NEBNext Multiplex Oligos for Illumina according to the manufacturer’s instructions (New England Biolabs). The quality and average length (insert size was approximately 200 bp) of cDNAs in the library were determined using a High Sensitivity DNA chip on a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies).
Libraries were sequenced (paired-end, 2 × 101 bp) on five lanes of HiSeq2000 (Illumina) at the Sequencing Service Center by the Stanford Center for Genomics and Personalized Medicine. The FASTX-toolkit ( Gordon and Hannon, 2010 25. Gordon, A. ∙ Hannon, G.J. Fastx Toolkit: FASTQ/A short-reads preprocessing tools htttp://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/ Date: 2010 Google Scholar ) was used for quality assessment and cleaning of reads. Reads were trimmed at the 5′ end by 13 bp to remove biases associated with random priming. Reads with Phred quality scores of less than 20 were trimmed from the 3′ end; reads were discarded if resulting length was less than 40 bp. Adaptors and low complexity sequences were removed. Before reads were aligned, the reference fasta files (SL2.50, http://plants.ensembl.org/index.html ) were pre-processed into an index that allow the aligner easy access using Bowtie 2 ( Langmead and Salzberg, 2012 34. Langmead, B. ∙ Salzberg, S.L. Fast gapped-read alignment with Bowtie 2 Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :357-359 Crossref Scopus (33760) PubMed Google Scholar ). Quality reads were aligned to the Heinz tomato genome using TopHat2 ( Kim et al., 2013 31. Kim, D. ∙ Pertea, G. ∙ Trapnell, C. ... TopHat2: accurate alignment of transcriptomes in the presence of insertions, deletions and gene fusions Genome Biol. 2013; 14 :R36 Crossref Scopus (9642) PubMed Google Scholar ). When aligning back to a reference genome, inclusion of intron/exon annotation (GTF file) with the RNA-Seq alignment significantly improves the quality of the alignments. Aligned sequence pairs were counted with HTSeq ( Anders et al., 2015 2. Anders, S. ∙ Pyl, P.T. ∙ Huber, W. HTSeq--a Python framework to work with high-throughput sequencing data Bioinformatics. 2015; 31 :166-169 Crossref Scopus (13500) PubMed Google Scholar ) and analyzed using edgeR ( Robinson et al., 2010 50. Robinson, M.D. ∙ McCarthy, D.J. ∙ Smyth, G.K. edgeR: a Bioconductor package for differential expression analysis of digital gene expression data Bioinformatics. 2010; 26 :139-140 Crossref Scopus (26703) PubMed Google Scholar ) to identify differentially expressed genes between treatments, resulting in counts per million (CPM) mapped reads. By default, edgeR uses the number of mapped reads and estimates an additional normalization factor (using TMM, Trimmed Mean of M-values) to account for sample-specific effects. Gene annotation analysis was done by blastx ( Camacho et al., 2009 14. Camacho, C. ∙ Coulouris, G. ∙ Avagyan, V. ... BLAST+: architecture and applications BMC Bioinformatics. 2009; 10 :421 Crossref Scopus (12201) PubMed Google Scholar ) using the Arabidopsis thaliana proteome (The Arabidopsis Information Resource) as a database and the NCBI non-redundant database, if necessary.
A pre-processed transcriptome was assembled de novo using Velvet and Oases ( Schulz et al., 2012 55. Schulz, M.H. ∙ Zerbino, D.R. ∙ Vingron, M. ... Oases: robust de novo RNA-seq assembly across the dynamic range of expression levels Bioinformatics. 2012; 28 :1086-1092 Crossref Scopus (1121) PubMed Google Scholar ) with a k-mer of 71. The clustering tool CD-HIT-EST ( Li and Godzik, 2006 37. Li, W. ∙ Godzik, A. Cd-hit: a fast program for clustering and comparing large sets of protein or nucleotide sequences Bioinformatics. 2006; 22 :1658-1659 Crossref Scopus (7526) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used to identify sequences with greater than 99% identity from the assembly. The set of transcripts was further assembled with CAP3 ( Huang and Madan, 1999 28. Huang, X. ∙ Madan, A. CAP3: a DNA sequence assembly program Genome Res. 1999; 9 :868-877 Crossref Scopus (4247) PubMed Google Scholar ) to combine contigs with significant overlaps (minimum 95% identity over at least 100 bp).
mRNA was isolated from tomato leaves treated with S. epidermidis for 48 hpi using the Spectrum Plant Total RNA Kit (Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA was synthesized from the mRNA using Super Script IV First Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen) and then stored at −20 ° C. All genes sequences were amplified by PCR using the cDNA, gene specific primers (Integrated DNA Technologies, Table S4), and Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Thermo Scientific). Amplicons were inserted into pEAQ-HT ( Sainsbury et al., 2009 53. Sainsbury, F. ∙ Thuenemann, E.C. ∙ Lomonossoff, G.P. pEAQ: versatile expression vectors for easy and quick transient expression of heterologous proteins in plants Plant Biotechnol. J. 2009; 7 :682-693 Crossref Scopus (630) PubMed Google Scholar ) linearized with AgeI and XhoI (New England Biolabs) using Gibson assembly ( Gibson et al., 2009 24. Gibson, D.G. ∙ Young, L. ∙ Chuang, R.Y. ... Enzymatic assembly of DNA molecules up to several hundred kilobases Nat. Methods. 2009; 6 :343-345 Crossref Scopus (6582) PubMed Google Scholar ) and then plasmid mixtures were transformed into E. coli TOP10 cells (Invitrogen). Gene sequences were confirmed by Sanger DNA sequencing (Elim Biopharm).
pEAQ-HT plasmids ( Sainsbury et al., 2009 53. Sainsbury, F. ∙ Thuenemann, E.C. ∙ Lomonossoff, G.P. pEAQ: versatile expression vectors for easy and quick transient expression of heterologous proteins in plants Plant Biotechnol. J. 2009; 7 :682-693 Crossref Scopus (630) PubMed Google Scholar ) containing candidate tomato genes or GFP (negative control) were independently transformed into A. tumefaciens (GV3101) and then selected for on LB plates containing 50 μg/mL kanamycin, 30 μg/mL gentamicin at 30°C for 3 days. Single colonies were then grown on fresh plates. Patches of cells were scraped off each plate with a pipette tip, suspended into 1 mL of 10 mM MgCl 2 , centrifuged at 5,000 g for 5 min, and supernatant discarded. The pellet was resuspended in 1 mL of Agrobacterium induction media (10 mM MES, PH 5.6, 10 mM MgCl 2 , and 150 μM acetosyringone; Acros Organics) and incubated at room temperature for 1-2 hours. A. tumefaciens suspensions (OD 600 = 0.3 for each strain) were infiltrated into the underside of N. benthamiana leaves with a needleless 1 mL syringe. Leaves from different plants (n = 3) were harvested 3 days post-infiltration (dpi), frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C.
Frozen leaf tissues were lyophilized to dryness. The samples (n = 3, 10 mg of dried tissue/tube) were homogenized on a ball mill (Retsch MM 400) using 5 mm diameter stainless steel beads, shaking at 25 Hz for 2 min.
60 μL of an 80:20 MeOH/H 2 O (v/v) solution was added per milligram of dry tissue, and the mixture was heated at 65 ° C for 10 min and filtered through 0.45 μm PTFE filters before liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis. Extraction solvent composition was selected to capture the wide range of polarity of compounds in the tissues.
80 μL of methanol was added per milligram of dry tissue. After incubation at room temperature for 20 min with continuous mixing, samples were filtered through 0.45 μm PTFE filters before liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis.
Dried leaf extract from above was mixed with 200 μL of 6% KOH. Tubes were incubated for 2 hours at 60°C with continuous shaking. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture was acidified by the addition of 50 μL of 29% HCl. Tubes were vortexed thoroughly and spun for 30 s using a table centrifuge. The fatty acids were extracted with 500 μL of chloroform/hexane mixture (1:4, v:v). After vortexing and 10 s of centrifugation, the organic phase was collected. Extraction with the chloroform/hexane mixture was repeated twice and the collected fatty acid containing organic phases was combined and dried under N 2 . The final product was dissolved in 200 μL of 100% MeOH for LC-MS analysis.
Samples were analyzed by reversed-phase chromatography on an Agilent 1260 HPLC, using a 5 μm, 2 × 100 mm Gemini NX-C 18 column (Phenomenex). Water with 0.1% formic acid (A) and Acetonitirile with 0.1% formic acid (B) were used as the mobile phase components at a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min with the following 55 min gradient; i) for methanol extracts: 0-30 min, 3%–50% B; 30-45 min, 50%–97% B; 45-50 min, 97% B; 50-51 min, 97%–3% B; 51-55 min, 3% B, ii) for saponified extracts: 0-45 min, 40%–97% B; 45-50 min, 97% B; 50-51 min, 97%–40% B; 51-55 min, 40% B. A coupled Agilent 6520 Accurate-Mass Q-TOF ESI mass spectrometer was used to collect MS data in positive ion mode (parameters: mass range: 100-1700 m/z ; drying gas: 300°C, 1 L/min; nebulizer: 25 psig; capillary: 3500 V; fragmentor: 150 V; skimmer: 65 V; OCT 1 RF Vpp: 750 V; 1000 ms per spectrum). The first minute of each run was discarded to avoid salt contamination of the MS apparatus. For tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis, 5, 10, 20 and 40 V collision energies were used with an m/z window of 1.3 centered on the m/z analyzed.
CRISPR mutant tomato leaves and heterologous expression tobacco samples were analyzed by reversed-phase chromatography on an Agilent 1290 HPLC, using a 1.8 μm 2.1 × 50 mm Zorbax RRHD Eclipse C18 column (Agilent). Water with 0.1% formic acid (A) and Acetonitirile with 0.1% formic acid (B) were used as the mobile phase components at a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min with the following 15 min gradient; i) for methanol extracts: 0-12 min, 3%–97% B; 12-13 min, 97% B; 13-14 min, 97%–3% B; 14-15 min, 3% B, ii) for saponified extracts: 0-12 min, 40%–97% B; 12-13 min, 97% B; 13-14 min, 97%–3% B; 14-15 min, 3% B; 1 min for equilibrium to 40% B. A coupled Agilent 6545 quadrupole time-of-flight (qTOF) mass spectrometer with an electrospray ion source (dual-inlet Agilent Jet Stream or “dual AJS”) was used to collect MS data in positive ion mode (parameters: mass range: 100-1700 m/z; drying gas: 300°C, 3 L/min; nebulizer: 35 psig; capillary: 3500 V; fragmentor: 150 V; skimmer: 65 V; OCT 1 RF Vpp: 750 V; 1000 ms per spectrum). The first half minute of each run was discarded to avoid salt contamination of the MS apparatus.
MS data were analyzed using MassHunter Qualitative Analysis software (Agilent) and XCMS (Scripps Center for Metabolomics) ( Smith et al., 2006 56. Smith, C.A. ∙ Want, E.J. ∙ O’Maille, G. ... XCMS: processing mass spectrometry data for metabolite profiling using nonlinear peak alignment, matching, and identification Anal. Chem. 2006; 78 :779-787 Crossref Scopus (3802) PubMed Google Scholar ). For untargeted metabolomics, MassHunter (Agilent) data files were converted to mzXML format using trapper (Seattle Proteome Center). Grouped mzXML files were preprocessed and analyzed by XCMS, using the following sample R script: # see https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/xcms/versions/1.46.0 for default parameter information library(xcms) xset < - xcmsSet() # default parameters: method = ’matchedfilter’ # fwhm = 30 xset < - group(xset)# default parameters: method = ‘density’ # minfrac = 0.5, # minsamp = 1, # mzwid = 0.25 xset2 < - retcor(xset,family = ”s,”plottype = ”m”) xset2 < - group(xset2) xset3 < - retcor(xset2,family = ”s,”plottype = ”m”) xset3 < - group(xset3) xset4 < - retcor(xset3,family = ”s,”plottype = ”m”) xset4 < - group(xset4,bw = 10) xset5 < - fillPeaks(xset4) reporttab < - diffreport(xset5,”Cf_12h_1,””Mk_12h_1,””Cf_12h_1 versus Mk_12h_1,” 500) The resulting report contains a mass peak list with m / z values, peak intensity fold change, statistical significance ( p-value , two-tailed unequal variance Student’s t test), retention times, and extracted peak intensities. The list was filtered using cutoff criteria (generally, p-value less than 0.05, t- value greater than 0, fold change greater than 5, retention time less than 2700 s, and average peak intensity greater than 5 × 10e+4 in the experimental sample group [in the above case, Cf_12h_1]) to yield a narrow list for further analysis. All MS data were aligned and processed together by XCMS to enable direct comparison across all sample types. Each tsv file contains the most significant mass signals (unfiltered for signal abundance, p-value etc.) found in a treatment versus (respective) mock pairwise comparison.
The untargeted analysis described in Figure S6 F was conducted independently from the untargeted analysis in Figure S1A; aside from analysis of falcarindiol, we did not attempt to match metabolite identities between experiments.
Falcarindiol ( 1 ) was purchased from ArboNova (Finland). Crepenynic acid ( 2 ) was purchased from INDOFINE Chemical Company, Inc. (USA). Chloro(pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)(cyclooctadiene)ruthenium(II), ethyl azidoacetate, and 4-azidotoluene were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (USA).
Click chemistry was performed on saponified lipids isolated from N. benthamiana expressing the 240/260 cDNA and falcarindiol spiked-in saponified N. benthamiana extract as a positive control. For the reaction, Cp ∗ RuCl (COD) (1.0 mg, 0.0025 mmol) was added to a 1.5 mL glass vial containing reactants dissolved in 1 mL of acetone followed by 4-azidotoluene (0.50 mmol) or ethylazidoacetate (0.025 mmol) ( Boren et al., 2008 7. Boren, B.C. ∙ Narayan, S. ∙ Rasmussen, L.K. ... Ruthenium-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition: scope and mechanism J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2008; 130 :8923-8930 Crossref Scopus (727) PubMed Google Scholar ). The reaction was stirred at room temperature for 16 h and then analyzed by LC-MS.
∼3 g (FW) of leaves were harvested from a 6-week old VF-36 S. lycopersicum plant. The harvested leaves were immediately ground in liquid N 2 . The ground leaf tissue was transferred to a 50 mL falcon tube containing 20 mL of warm (65°C) Carlson buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl at pH 9.5, 2% CTAB, 1.4 M NaCl, 1% PEG 8000, 20 mM EDTA, and β-mercaptoethanol, freshly added to 0.25% v/v). 40 μL of RNase A (100 mg/mL) was added to the mix. The tube was briefly vortexed and then incubated at 65°C for 1 h. The tube was centrifuged at 5,040 g for 10 min. The supernatant was collected, extracted in 0.7 volumes of isopropanol, and then placed at −80°C for 15 min. The tube was then centrifuged at 5,040 g for 40 min. The pellet was then resuspended in G2 buffer (QIAGEN). The resuspended pellet was purified using a QIAGEN 500-G Genomic Tip gravity column, and then was precipitated in 0.7 volumes of isopropanol. The sample was then centrifuged at 5,040 g for 40 min, and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was washed in 4 mL of ice-cold 70% ethanol. The sample was centrifuged for 14 min at 5,040 g . The supernatant was decanted and the pellet was resuspended in 80 μL of TE buffer (pH 8.0). The sample had a concentration of 1621 ng/μL, 260/280 ratio of 1.82, 260/230 ratio of 2.22 (as measured using Nanodrop). The sample was diluted to 120 ng/μL (dilutions based on concentrations obtained through Qubit dsDNA HS Assay). The DNA was size-selected using AMPure XP SPRI beads (Beckman Coulter) in a custom-made buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl at pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 1.6 M NaCl, and 11% PEG 8000). The read length distribution was analyzed using an Agilient 4200 TapeStation instrument.
The Nanopore SQK-LSK109 protocol was used for library prep. The library was sequenced using a R9.4 MinION flow cell (FLO-MIN106). The reads were base-called using Guppy basecaller. Quality control of the basecalled reads was performed using NanoPlot ( De Coster et al., 2018 19. De Coster, W. ∙ D’Hert, S. ∙ Schultz, D.T. ... NanoPack: visualizing and processing long-read sequencing data Bioinformatics. 2018; 34 :2666-2669 Crossref Scopus (1468) PubMed Google Scholar ). The sequencing run yielded a total yield of 4.01 Gb (read length N50 of 21.02 kb). Reads containing the transcripts of interest were identified using minimap2 and were subsequently assembled using Geneious assembler ( Li, 2018 36. Li, H. Minimap2: pairwise alignment for nucleotide sequences Bioinformatics. 2018; 34 :3094-3100 Crossref Scopus (5678) PubMed Google Scholar ). Finally, read mappings to the target contig were manually inspected to verify the correctness of the assembly.
DNA sequences of Solyc12g100240 and Solyc12g100260 region were determined by primer walking using the chain termination method. Briefly, Solyc12g100240 and Solyc12g100260 coding sequence including 0.7∼0.9kb upstream and downstream region was PCR amplified using gene specific primers (240 region Fwd/Rev and 260 region Fwd/Rev), respectively ( Table S4 ). Amplified PCR products were directly sequenced (Genewiz) using 240/260 seq primers ( Table S4 ).
CRISPR/Cas9 target sites were selected by CRISPR-P 2.0 ( http://cbi.hzau.edu.cn/CRISPR2/ ; Liu et al., 2017 40. Liu, H. ∙ Ding, Y. ∙ Zhou, Y. ... CRISPR-P 2.0: an improved CRISPR-Cas9 tool for genome editing in plants Mol. Plant. 2017; 10 :530-532 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (452) PubMed Google Scholar ). To generate sgRNA constructs for Solyc12g100270, Solyc12g100240/260 and Solyc12g100250, sgRNA with specific target sequences were PCR amplified from pDONR207(AtU6p-sgRNA with attL1 and attL2; from Jeffrey Dangl, UNC Chapel Hill) using primer sets 270 target 1 or 270 target 2 /sgRNArev and 240/260 target 1 or 240/260 target 2/sgRNArev, and 250 target 1 or 250 target 2/sgRNArev, respectively. Each PCR product was self-ligated and the product was recombined into pMDC83 ( Curtis and Grossniklaus, 2003 18. Curtis, M.D. ∙ Grossniklaus, U. A gateway cloning vector set for high-throughput functional analysis of genes in planta Plant Physiol. 2003; 133 :462-469 Crossref Scopus (2096) PubMed Google Scholar ) with Cas9-HA-NLS using LR clonase II (ThermoFisher). The final plasmids were transformed into A. tumefaciens strain LBA4404. Strains were then used to transform and regenerate tomato VF36 plants using standard methods ( McCormick, 1997 42. McCormick, S. Transformation of tomato with Agrobacterium tumefaciens Lindsey, K. (Editor) Plant Tissue Culture Manual: Supplement 7 Springer Netherlands, 1997; 311-319 Google Scholar ). Homozygous mutant T1 plants were selected by using PAGE-based genotyping ( Zhu et al., 2014 64. Zhu, X. ∙ Xu, Y. ∙ Yu, S. ... An efficient genotyping method for genome-modified animals and human cells generated with CRISPR/Cas9 system Sci. Rep. 2014; 4 :6420 Crossref Scopus (208) PubMed Google Scholar ). To confirm the mutations, DNA surrounding CRISPR/Cas9 target sites were PCR amplified from the genomic DNA of mutant T1 candidates using gene specific primer sets ( Table S4 ) and then sequenced (Genewiz).
Leaves of homozygous T1 tomato mutant lines (Δ ACET1 , n = 5; Δ270, n = 5) and wild-type VF36 tomato (n = 6) were inoculated with C. fulvum (OD 600 = 1.0 in water) or mock as described in ‘Treatment of tomato leaves with biotic elicitors’ and collected at 3 days-post inoculation ( Figure S6 ). Frozen leaf tissues were lyophilized to dryness and then extracted with 80:20 MeOH/H 2 O (v/v) solution (60 μL per milligram of dry tissue) for LC-MS analysis as described in ‘ Methanol extraction of metabolites from tomato leaves after elicitation ’.
Falcarindiol production in WT (n = 4) and mutant lines (Δ ACET1 , n = 3; Δ270, n = 5) after transient overexpression of genes via Agrobacterium-mediated transient assay was measured by LC-MS. Frozen leaf tissues were lyophilized to dryness and then extracted with 80:20 MeOH/H 2 O (v/v) solution (60 μL per milligram of dry tissue) for LC-MS analysis as described in ‘ Methanol extraction of metabolites from tomato leaves after elicitation ’.
For analysis of Δ250 CRISPR lines (n = 4), extractions were performed as for Δ ACET1 and Δ270 CRISPR lines, described above, except that 40 μL of 80:20 MeOH/H 2 O (v/v) solution was added per milligram of dry tissue, thus making these extracts for which data is shown in Figure 5 D more concentrated than those shown in Figures 5 B and 5C. Note, we did not normalize the data to account for the smaller extraction volume used for Δ250 CRISPR lines compared to Δ ACET1 and Δ270 CRISPR lines.
pEAQ-HT plasmids containing Solyc12g100260 ( ACET1 ), Solyc12g100270, and GFP (negative control) were independently transformed into A. tumefaciens (1D1249) and prepared for inoculation as described in ‘Heterologous expression of candidate proteins in N. benthamiana ’. Agrobacteria suspensions (OD 600 = 0.1 for each strain) were infiltrated into the underside of tomato leaves with a needleless 1 mL syringe. Each strain was inoculated into separate leaflet in the same leaf and leaves were harvested 3 days post-infiltration (dpi), frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C.
Botrytis cinerea strain B05.10 (courtesy of Hailing Jin, University of California, Riverside) was grown on PDA (Potato Dextrose Agar) at 22°C for 10 days. Spores were collected in 50 mM glucose and 33 mM KH 2 PO 4 solution ( Audenaert et al., 2002 3. Audenaert, K. ∙ De Meyer, G.B. ∙ Höfte, M.M. Abscisic acid determines basal susceptibility of tomato to Botrytis cinerea and suppresses salicylic acid-dependent signaling mechanisms Plant Physiol. 2002; 128 :491-501 Crossref Scopus (452) PubMed Google Scholar ) and counted and adjusted to 10 5 spores/ml in the same solution. Five-week-old tomato leaves were excised and transferred onto 0.8% water agar in square plates. Four μl of the spore solution were dropped on the surface of the leaves and incubated at 22°C with 16 h light / 8 h dark cycle for 3 days. For disease quantification, lesion size was measured by using ImageJ software ( https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/ ) and fungal biomass was quantified by qPCR ( Wang et al., 2016 61. Wang, M. ∙ Weiberg, A. ∙ Lin, F.M. ... Bidirectional cross-kingdom RNAi and fungal uptake of external RNAs confer plant protection Nat. Plants. 2016; 2 :16151 Crossref Scopus (496) PubMed Google Scholar ) using Botrytis and tomato specific primers, Bc-ITS F/R and tomato tubulin F/R, respectively ( Table S4 ).
Xanthomonas euvesicatoria (Xe) 85-10 strains and Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) DC3000 strains were grown on nutrient yeast glycerol agar media at 28°C. To monitor Xe and Pst growth in tomato plants, 5-week-old leaves were hand-infiltrated with a 1 × 10 5 cfu/ml suspension of bacteria in 10 mM MgCl 2 using a needless syringae. Each time point, four leaf discs (0.5cm 2 ) were ground in 10 mM MgCl 2 and diluted and spotted onto NYGA plates.
Total RNA was isolated from leaves using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s instructions and 5 μg RNA was used for cDNA synthesis usiing RevertAid H Minus Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed using the cDNA and gene-specific primers (see Table S4 ). Each cDNA was amplified using Green Taq DNA polymerase (GenScript) with EvaGreen Dye (Biotium) and the MJ Opticon 2 (Bio-Rad). Tomato Actin expression was used to normalize expression value in each sample, and relative expression values were determined against 10 mM MgCl 2 using the comparative Ct method (2-ΔΔCt) ( Pfaffl, 2001 47. Pfaffl, M.W. A new mathematical model for relative quantification in real-time RT-PCR Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29 :e45 Crossref Scopus (27788) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Unless otherwise noted, statistical analysis was performed in Microsoft Excel 2016 for two-tailed Student’s t test comparisons. The number of times each experiment was repeated is given in the respective sections.
