Title: Differential mosquito attraction to humans is associated with skin-derived carboxylic acid levels


Abstract: Summary

Some people are more attractive to mosquitoes than others, but the mechanistic basis of this phenomenon is poorly understood. We tested mosquito attraction to human skin odor and identified people who are exceptionally attractive or unattractive to mosquitoes. These differences were stable over several years. Chemical analysis revealed that highly attractive people produce significantly more carboxylic acids in their skin emanations. Mutant mosquitoes lacking the chemosensory co-receptors Ir8a , Ir25a , or Ir76b were severely impaired in attraction to human scent, but retained the ability to differentiate highly and weakly attractive people. The link between elevated carboxylic acids in “mosquito-magnet” human skin odor and phenotypes of genetic mutations in carboxylic acid receptors suggests that such compounds contribute to differential mosquito attraction. Understanding why some humans are more attractive than others provides insights into what skin odorants are most important to the mosquito and could inform the development of more effective repellents.

Section: Introduction

The globally invasive mosquito Aedes aegypti is a highly efficient vector of viruses including yellow fever, dengue, chikungunya, and Zika among human populations ( Bhatt et al., 2013 13. Bhatt, S. ∙ Gething, P.W. ∙ Brady, O.J. ... The global distribution and burden of dengue Nature. 2013; 496 :504-507 Crossref Scopus (6727) PubMed Google Scholar ). A single female mosquito will bite multiple humans during her 3- to 6-week lifetime to obtain sufficient protein to produce a new batch of eggs as often as every 4 days ( Ponlawat and Harrington, 2005 61. Ponlawat, A. ∙ Harrington, L.C. Blood feeding patterns of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus in Thailand J. Med. Entomol. 2005; 42 :844-849 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). This repetitive human-directed feeding behavior allows the mosquito to contract and transmit pathogens in successive bites. Aedes aegypti are efficient vectors of disease because they specialize on human hosts ( McBride et al., 2014 50. McBride, C.S. ∙ Baier, F. ∙ Omondi, A.B. ...

Mosquito brains encode unique features of human odour to drive host seeking Nature. 2022; 605 :706-712 Crossref Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ), thereby focusing pathogen transmission on our species. Female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes have a strong innate drive to hunt humans, using sensory cues including exhaled carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), body heat, and skin odor. Although CO 2 and heat are generic stimuli that signify a living warm-blooded animal, skin odor provides information about whether the target is a human or non-human animal ( McBride et al., 2014 50.

It is well-documented that mosquitoes are more strongly attracted to some humans than others ( Acree et al., 1968 3. Acree, Jr., F. ∙ Turner, R.B. ∙ Gouck, H.K. ...

The observation that some people are “mosquito magnets” is a topic that captivates the general public and scientific community alike. There is much speculation about possible mechanisms, but only some have a scientific basis. A common explanation offered by non-experts is that differences in ABO blood type “explain” attractiveness to mosquitoes, but experimental data that address this belief are contradictory ( Anjomruz et al., 2014 5.

A double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of garlic as a mosquito repellant: a preliminary study Med. Vet. Entomol. 2005; 19 :84-89 Crossref Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ) or B vitamins ( Ives and Paskewitz, 2005 35. Ives, A.R. ∙ Paskewitz, S.M., Inter-L&S 101, Biology Interest Groups, and Entomology Class 201 Testing vitamin B as a home remedy against mosquitoes J. Am. Mosq. Control Assoc. 2005; 21 :213-217 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ) as a home remedy to repel mosquitoes is similarly unclear. Although a twin study documented a strong heritable component ( Fernández-Grandon et al., 2015 24. Fernández-Grandon, G.M. ∙ Gezan, S.A. ∙ Armour, J.A. ... Heritability of attractiveness to mosquitoes PLOS One. 2015; 10 :e0122716 Crossref Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ), non-genetic factors also contribute to selective attractiveness to mosquitoes.

Shirai, O. ∙ Tsuda, T. ∙ Kitagawa, S. ... Alcohol ingestion stimulates mosquito attraction J. Am. Mosq. Control Assoc. 2002; 18 :91-96 PubMed Google Scholar ). The most widely accepted explanation for these differences is that variation in skin odors produced by different humans, related in part to their unique skin microbiota ( Braks and Takken, 1999 15.

Entomol. 2006; 20 :280-287 Crossref Scopus (100) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the specific chemical mechanism for differential attractiveness to mosquitoes remains unclear.
Human skin odor is a blend of many organic compounds ( Bernier et al., 1999 9. Bernier, U.R. ∙ Booth, M.M. ∙ Yost, R.A. Analysis of human skin emanations by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. 1.

Analyses of volatile organic compounds from human skin Br. J. Dermatol. 2008; 159 :780-791 Crossref Scopus (338) PubMed Google Scholar ), the composition of which has not been exhaustively inventoried. It remains unclear how consistent human skin odor is over time within an individual. Although much work has focused on characterizing human axillary (armpit) malodor, there is relatively little information about the composition of the markedly less intense skin odor that emanates from body sites commonly bitten by mosquitoes. Furthermore, additional work is needed before we can fully appreciate the extent of inter-individual variation in human skin odor. Thus, it is not known which specific components are most relevant for mosquito attraction to humans, nor do we understand which odorants cause mosquitoes to choose to bite some people over others. Humans who are highly attractive to mosquitoes may produce more attractant odors than other people ( McBride et al., 2014 50. McBride, C.S. ∙ Baier, F. ∙ Omondi, A.B. ... Evolution of mosquito preference for humans linked to an odorant receptor Nature. 2014; 515 :222-227 Crossref Scopus (331) PubMed Google Scholar ). Alternatively, less attractive humans may emit compounds that repel mosquitoes ( Logan et al., 2008 46. Logan, J.G. ∙ Birkett, M.A. ∙ Clark, S.J. ... Identification of human-derived volatile chemicals that interfere with attraction of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes J. Chem. Ecol. 2008; 34 :308-322 Crossref Scopus (191) PubMed Google Scholar , 2010 47. Logan, J.G. ∙ Stanczyk, N.M. ∙ Hassanali, A. ... Arm-in-cage testing of natural human-derived mosquito repellents Malar. J. 2010; 9 :239 Crossref Scopus (96) PubMed Google Scholar ). To date, no single molecule obtained from human skin can be said to be sufficient to explain how attractive a person is to mosquitoes. Blends of odorants can be more or less attractive depending on the composition of the blend and the concentration of a specific molecule. For example, the binary blend of ammonia and lactic acid strongly synergizes to elicit mosquito attraction ( Geier et al., 1999 27. Geier, M. ∙ Bosch, O.J. ∙ Boeckh, J. Ammonia as an attractive component of host odour for the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti Chem. Senses. 1999; 24 :647-653 Crossref Scopus (135) PubMed Google Scholar ; Steib et al., 2001 75.

Senses. 2001; 26 :523-528 Crossref Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although carboxylic acids are neutral or repellent when presented individually or in combination with each other, they strongly increase mosquito attraction when combined with ammonia and lactic acid ( Smallegange et al., 2005 74. Smallegange, R.C. ∙ Qiu, Y.T. ∙ van Loon, J.J. ... Synergism between ammonia, lactic acid and carboxylic acids as kairomones in the host-seeking behaviour of the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto (Diptera: Culicidae) Chem.

The effect of aliphatic carboxylic acids on olfaction-based host-seeking of the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto J. Chem. Ecol. 2009; 35 :933-943 Crossref Scopus (90) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mosquito attraction behavior is elicited much more reliably using live human hosts or natural odor blends collected directly from humans, than it is by mixing pre-specified compounds, despite improvements in synthetic odor blends as lures for attract-and-kill traps for use in the field ( Bernier et al., 2007 10. Bernier, U.R. ∙ Kline, D.L. ∙ Allan, S.A. ... Laboratory comparison of Aedes aegypti attraction to human odors and to synthetic human odor compounds and blends J. Am. Mosq.

Improvement of a synthetic lure for Anopheles gambiae using compounds produced by human skin microbiota Malar. J. 2011; 10 :28 Crossref Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, the current absence of a complete reference metabolome of chemical compounds found on human skin, and the lack of commercially available standard molecules for many skin compounds also limits the effectiveness of human odor blend reconstitution approaches for studying mosquito attraction.
Mosquitoes use two large multigene families to detect olfactory cues that each encode odor-gated ion channels, the odorant receptors (ORs) and the ionotropic receptors (IRs) ( Abuin et al., 2011 1.

ORs and IRs are evolutionarily unrelated, but both assemble into multi-subunit complexes with a ligand-selective subunit and a co-receptor subunit that does not respond to odorants ( Abuin et al., 2011 1.

Neurosci. 2011; 31 :13357-13375 Crossref Scopus (359) PubMed Google Scholar ). There are hundreds of ligand-selective ORs and IRs in a given insect species, but only one OR co-receptor ( Orco ) and three IR co-receptors ( Ir8a , Ir76b , and Ir25a ). In Aedes aegypti , there are 116 ligand-selective ORs and 132 ligand-selective IRs ( Matthews et al., 2018 49. Matthews, B.J. ∙ Dudchenko, O. ∙ Kingan, S.B. ... Improved reference genome of Aedes aegypti informs arbovirus vector control Nature. 2018; 563 :501-507 Crossref Scopus (325) PubMed Google Scholar ). Together, these large gene families of odor-gated ion channels sense a vast number of chemical ligands. Although there is some overlap in ligand tuning, ORs generally respond to esters, alcohols, ketones, and aldehydes, and IRs respond to carboxylic acids and amines ( Hallem and Carlson, 2006 30.

Because of this co-receptor organization, mutating a single co-receptor gene leads to profound deficits in the ability of an insect to detect whole classes of odorants ( Abuin et al., 2011 1.

Animals lacking the major receptor for CO 2 , Gr3 , continue to be attracted to humans in semi-field conditions ( McMeniman et al., 2014 51. McMeniman, C.J. ∙ Corfas, R.A. ∙ Matthews, B.J. ...

Mosquitoes with a loss-of-function mutation in Orco lose strong preference for humans over non-human animals but retain strong attraction to humans overall ( DeGennaro et al., 2013 22.

Biol. 2019; 29 :1253-1262.e7 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (115) PubMed Google Scholar ). Finally, Ir8a mutants show severe deficits in detecting lactic acid, a major human skin odor, but nevertheless remain partially attracted to humans ( Raji et al., 2019 65. Raji, J.I. ∙ Melo, N. ∙ Castillo, J.S. ... Aedes aegypti mosquitoes detect acidic volatiles found in human odor using the IR8a pathway Curr. Biol. 2019; 29 :1253-1262.e7 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (115) PubMed Google Scholar ). The recent discovery of extensive co-expression of ORs and IRs in single olfactory sensory neurons may explain this functional redundancy ( Herre et al., 2022 32.

In this paper, we analyzed the skin-derived compounds that differentiate highly from weakly attractive humans and asked which mosquito sensory pathways are required to distinguish such people. We designed a two-choice behavioral assay to test mosquito attraction with higher throughput, allowing for frequent, repeat sampling of human subjects. We collected human skin odor samples on nylon stockings worn on the forearms and profiled the attractiveness of 64 human subjects to mosquitoes. We identified a cohort of highly and weakly attractive people and discovered that the Orco co-receptor is not required for discriminating between them. Mutants lacking Ir8a , Ir76b , and Ir25a retained a preference for “mosquito magnets” but showed an overall reduced attraction to human skin odor ( Raji et al., 2019 65. Raji, J.I. ∙ Melo, N. ∙ Castillo, J.S. ... Aedes aegypti mosquitoes detect acidic volatiles found in human odor using the IR8a pathway Curr. Biol. 2019; 29 :1253-1262.e7 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (115) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, although neither the OR nor the IR pathway is solely required for discriminating among different people, mutating the IR pathway produced significantly stronger effects on overall mosquito attraction to humans than the OR pathway. We used gas chromatography/quadrupole time of flight-mass spectrometry (GC/QTOF-MS) to identify skin odor molecules that are associated with attractiveness to mosquitoes. Because carboxylic acids have been shown to be attractive to mosquitoes ( Smallegange et al., 2009 73. Smallegange, R.C. ∙ Qiu, Y.T. ∙ Bukovinszkiné-Kiss, G. ... The effect of aliphatic carboxylic acids on olfaction-based host-seeking of the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto J. Chem. Ecol. 2009; 35 :933-943 Crossref Scopus (90) PubMed Google Scholar ), we focused our chemical analysis on detecting acids in the human skin odor blend by using specialized sample preparation to enrich for highly polar acids. Since these are otherwise difficult to detect using standard analytical chemistry approaches, their contribution to differential mosquito attraction to humans is relatively understudied ( Bernier et al., 2000 11. Bernier, U.R. ∙ Kline, D.L. ∙ Barnard, D.R. ... Analysis of human skin emanations by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. 2. Identification of volatile compounds that are candidate attractants for the yellow fever mosquito ( Aedes aegypti ) Anal. Chem. 2000; 72 :747-756 Crossref Scopus (353) PubMed Google Scholar ). We determined that highly attractive humans have higher levels of several carboxylic acids on their skin than less attractive humans. When we substantially diluted nylons from the most highly attractive subject, mosquitoes were no longer able to distinguish this subject from the least attractive subjects. Our results strongly suggest a link between the known function of IRs in acid-sensing and our observation that high levels of skin-derived carboxylic acids are associated with a person being a “mosquito magnet.”

Section: Results

In previous studies, we used a two-choice Gouck olfactometer ( Gouck, 1972 29. Gouck, H.K. Host preferences of various strains of Aedes aegypti and A. simpsoni as determined by an olfactometer Bull. World Health Organ. 1972; 47 :680-683 PubMed Google Scholar ) to characterize female Aedes aegypti preferences for a human or non-human animal ( DeGennaro et al., 2013 22. DeGennaro, M. ∙ McBride, C.S. ∙ Seeholzer, L. ... orco mutant mosquitoes lose strong preference for humans and are not repelled by volatile DEET Nature. 2013; 498 :487-491 Crossref Scopus (319) PubMed Google Scholar ; McBride et al., 2014 50. McBride, C.S. ∙ Baier, F. ∙ Omondi, A.B. ... Evolution of mosquito preference for humans linked to an odorant receptor Nature. 2014; 515 :222-227 Crossref Scopus (331) PubMed Google Scholar ). This large apparatus was not suitable for the higher-throughput analysis of mosquito preference for humans required for this study. We therefore adapted a previously described single-stimulus olfactometer ( Basrur et al., 2020 7. Basrur, N.S. ∙ De Obaldia, M.E. ∙ Morita, T. ... Fruitless mutant male mosquitoes gain attraction to human odor eLife. 2020; 9 :e63982 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) to reconfigure it as a two-choice olfactometer ( Figure 1 A), allowing us to test mosquito preferences between the forearms of two different live human subjects or their forearm skin odor collected on nylon sleeves. In this assay, a mixture of air and CO 2 was passed over each stimulus to convey volatile odors to mosquitoes downwind ( Figure 1 A). Mosquitoes flew upwind and those that entered either of the two cylindrical traps in front of each stimulus were scored as attracted. This assay tests attraction to stimuli that are ∼0.91 m away, meaning that to reach the attraction trap, mosquitoes must travel ∼610 times their body length, assuming an average female mosquito thorax length of 1.5 mm ( Yeap et al., 2013 83. Yeap, H.L. ∙ Endersby, N.M. ∙ Johnson, P.H. ... Body size and wing shape measurements as quality indicators of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes destined for field release Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 2013; 89 :78-92 Crossref Scopus (71) PubMed Google Scholar ). During the 3.1-year course of this study, we carried out >2,330 behavior trials on 174 experimental days. There was no difference in attraction when mosquitoes were offered the left and right forearms of the same subject ( Figure 1 B). In pilot experiments comparing mosquito attraction among all possible pairings of three live human subjects, we identified one (subject 33) that was significantly more attractive than two others (subjects 25 and 28) ( Figure 1 B). When the two less attractive subjects were competed against each other, subject 25 attracted significantly more mosquitoes than subject 28 ( Figure 1 B).
The two-choice olfactometer as configured for live human subjects requires participants to be physically present for competitions that take place in a warm, humid room. To make it feasible to carry out hundreds of competitions between two subjects over many months, we collected human forearm odor on nylon sleeves ( DeGennaro et al., 2013 22. DeGennaro, M. ∙ McBride, C.S. ∙ Seeholzer, L. ... orco mutant mosquitoes lose strong preference for humans and are not repelled by volatile DEET Nature. 2013; 498 :487-491 Crossref Scopus (319) PubMed Google Scholar ; McBride et al., 2014 50. McBride, C.S. ∙ Baier, F. ∙ Omondi, A.B. ... Evolution of mosquito preference for humans linked to an odorant receptor Nature. 2014; 515 :222-227 Crossref Scopus (331) PubMed Google Scholar ). Empty stimulus traps did not attract mosquitoes, and mosquitoes did not prefer unworn nylon over an empty trap ( Figure 1 C). However, a 7.62 × 10.16 cm swatch cut from nylons worn by subject 25 was significantly more attractive than the same-sized swatch from an unworn nylon ( Figure 1 C). There was no evidence for side bias when we used nylons from subject 25 in both stimulus traps ( Figure 1 C).
To study inter-individual differences in attractiveness to mosquitoes, we recruited an additional 5 human subjects who provided skin-scented nylon samples frequently over a period of several months. Nylons worn by each of these 8 subjects were significantly more attractive than an unworn nylon ( Figure 1 D). However, there were remarkable differences in the attractiveness of the 8 subjects. Nylons from subject 28 attracted few mosquitoes, subject 25 showed intermediate attractiveness, whereas subject 33 was highly attractive ( Figure 1 D), mirroring the results of the live human experiments in Figure 1 B. This suggests that skin odor is the primary driver of differential mosquito attraction to humans, since temperature and CO 2 cues were held constant in all nylon experiments. It also suggests that skin odor captured on forearm-worn nylon is a good approximation of the odor emanating from a live human forearm. When we tested the 5 additional subjects, we found one additional low attractor (subject 19), two additional high attractors (subjects 24 and 31), and two subjects with intermediate attractiveness (subjects 30 and 32) ( Figure 1 D).
We reasoned that in a real-world situation, mosquitoes would choose among multiple different humans in a local area, such that the absolute attractiveness of a single human would not necessarily predict their attractiveness relative to another person. To systematically determine the relative attractiveness of these 8 humans to mosquitoes, we performed a round-robin style “tournament,” competing nylons from all possible subject pairings from this group of 8 subjects, for a total of 28 separate competitions using the two-choice olfactometer assay ( Figure 1 E). We sampled each pair of humans on 6 separate days over a period of several months (558 trials, performed over 42 experimental days). Among 28 subject pairs tested, we found 13 pairs for which mosquitoes significantly preferred one subject’s odor over the other ( Figure 1 E). Subject 33 attracted significantly more mosquitoes than every other subject in essentially every trial performed, usually by a large margin. Subjects 19 and 28 were significantly less attractive than several other subjects. Mosquitoes did not have a preference between the two low attractors, subjects 19 and 28 ( Figure 1 E). To rank subjects from most to least attractive, we devised an attraction score based on how many more mosquitoes each subject attracted when competed against all 7 other subjects. By this metric, subject 33 was the most attractive, yielding an attractiveness score that was 4 times the attractiveness score of the next most attractive subject, and over 100 times greater than that of the two least attractive subjects 19 and 28 ( Figure 1 F). These differences in attraction to specific pairs of humans were remarkably stable over many months and were seen with two different wild-type strains of Aedes aegypti ( Figures 1 G–1I). We provide empirical evidence that mosquitoes strongly prefer some people over others and that the olfactory cues that make some people “mosquito magnets” are stable over many months.
We have shown that small swatches of human-scented nylon provide enough information for mosquitoes to distinguish between and prefer one person over another. What sensory mechanisms do mosquitoes rely on to detect these inter-individual differences in skin odor? We tested the preference of mosquitoes lacking Orco , which retain strong attraction to humans, but show deficits in discriminating humans from non-human animals ( DeGennaro et al., 2013 22. DeGennaro, M. ∙ McBride, C.S. ∙ Seeholzer, L. ... orco mutant mosquitoes lose strong preference for humans and are not repelled by volatile DEET Nature. 2013; 498 :487-491 Crossref Scopus (319) PubMed Google Scholar ). We also tested mosquitoes lacking the co-receptor Ir8a , which is expressed in the antenna and is necessary for detection of several acids, including lactic acid, a component of human sweat ( Raji et al., 2019 65. Raji, J.I. ∙ Melo, N. ∙ Castillo, J.S. ... Aedes aegypti mosquitoes detect acidic volatiles found in human odor using the IR8a pathway Curr. Biol. 2019; 29 :1253-1262.e7 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (115) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We carried out control trials where nylons from subject 25 were placed in both stimulus boxes ( Figure 2 A) and found that Orco mutant mosquitoes showed wild-type levels of activation and attraction ( Figure 2 B). Ir8a mutants showed decreased overall attraction to subject 25 in the two-choice olfactometer assay, despite normal levels of activation, as defined by entry into the flying chamber ( Figure 2 C).
In the course of carrying out these control experiments, we noted low participation in some trials. Therefore, we put inclusion criteria in place such that trials in which 9 or fewer mosquitoes entered either trap were excluded ( Figures 2 D–2F). We note that low levels of participation preclude the accurate calculation of attraction preferences, such as an instance in which only three mosquitoes entered either trap. A high percentage of excluded trials may reflect an overall deficit in locomotor activity or general decreases in activation and attraction to human sensory cues or a combination of both factors.
More than 90% of all such control trials using both wild-type and Orco mutants resulted in at least 10 total mosquitoes being attracted to either stimulus ( Figure 2 E). In experiments examining Ir8a , 94% of trials using wild-type mosquitoes resulted in 10 or more total mosquitoes being attracted to either stimulus, but this was reduced to 73% for trials using Ir8a mutants ( Figure 2 F).
Among trials that met the inclusion criteria, Orco mutants did not differ from wild-type controls, retaining the ability to distinguish 5 pairs of highly and weakly attractive humans ( Figures 2 G and 2H). Ir8a mutants largely retained the same preferences as wild-type controls, despite their diminished overall attraction to human odor ( Figures 2 I and 2J). This suggests that mosquitoes with significant olfactory deficits are still able to tell the difference between individual people.
We next used CRISPR-Cas9 to generate mosquitoes that lack the two other IR co-receptors Ir76b and Ir25a ( Figures 3 A and 3B; Figure S1 ). We generated 2 mutant alleles of each gene ( Ir76b 32 , Ir76b 61 , Ir25a BamHI , and Ir25a 19 ) and tested the behavior of heterozygous animals of all 4 strains and the heteroallelic Ir76b 32/61 and Ir25a BamHI/19 null mutants. Homozygous Ir76b and Ir25a mutants had difficulty blood-feeding and Ir25a homozygous mutants generally laid fewer eggs. Notably, Anopheles coluzzii Ir76b null mutants show normal attraction to human host cues but do not blood-feed or produce eggs ( Ye et al., 2022 82. Ye, Z. ∙ Liu, F. ∙ Sun, H. ... Discrete roles of Ir76b ionotropic coreceptor impact olfaction, blood feeding, and mating in the malaria vector mosquito Anopheles coluzzii Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2022; 119 e2112385119 Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar ). To characterize the response of these strains and wild-type control mosquitoes to human cues, we first used a single-stimulus olfactometer ( Basrur et al., 2020 7. Basrur, N.S. ∙ De Obaldia, M.E. ∙ Morita, T. ... Fruitless mutant male mosquitoes gain attraction to human odor eLife. 2020; 9 :e63982 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) to examine activation and attraction levels ( Figure 3 C). Ir76b 32/61 mutants displayed reduced general activity levels in response to an unworn nylon or a nylon worn by subject 33 ( Figure 3 D). However, this defect was readily overcome when Ir76b mutants were presented with the forearm of subject 33, indicating the absence of gross motor defects ( Figure 3 D). Ir25a BamHI/19 mutants showed wild-type levels of activation across all stimuli tested ( Figure 3 E). Ir76b 32/61 mutants showed normal levels of attraction to nylons worn by subject 33 and to the forearm of subject 33 ( Figure 3 F). In contrast, Ir25a BamHI/19 mutants displayed significant defects in their attraction to both subject 33 nylons and to the forearm of subject 33 ( Figure 3 G). This suggests that the Ir25a co-receptor, along with one or more of the ligand-selective IRs with which it assembles a functional receptor, plays an important role in detecting human skin emanations.
Given the dramatic decrease in attraction of Ir25a BamHI/19 mutant mosquitoes to subject 33, we next asked if these mutants along with Ir76b 32/61 mutants could distinguish between nylons worn by highly and weakly attractive human subjects, when these were presented simultaneously in the two-choice olfactometer assay. The two-choice assay is substantially larger than the single-choice assay and thus may represent a more difficult behavioral task; hence, we expected that it might reveal additional phenotypes not seen in Figures 3 D–3G.
In control two-choice assay trials in which subject 25 nylons were placed in both stimulus boxes, Ir76b 32/61 mutants showed lower activation in response to human-worn nylons, and both Ir76b 32/61 and Ir25a BamHI/19 mutants showed significantly decreased attraction compared with wild-type controls ( Figure 4 A). Furthermore, only 25% of Ir76b 32/61 and 38% of Ir25a BamHI/19 mutant trials had at least 10 mosquitoes attracted to either stimulus, compared with 100% of wild-type trials ( Figure 4 B).
Analysis of trials that met these inclusion criteria showed that despite substantial defects in overall attraction to human odor, both Ir76b 32/61 and Ir25a BamHI/19 mutants distinguished highly and weakly attractive human subjects ( Figures 4 C–4E). These data indicate that mosquitoes have evolved highly redundant sensory systems permitting them to retain attraction to humans even with significant genetic disruption of their olfactory system ( Herre et al., 2022 32. Herre, M. ∙ Goldman, O.V. ∙ Lu, T.C. ... Non-canonical odor coding in the mosquito Cell. 2022; 185 :3104-3123.e28 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ). Nevertheless, mutating the IR pathway produced stronger effects on overall mosquito attraction to humans than the OR pathway.
We used GC/QTOF-MS to identify compounds on human-worn nylon that were associated with mosquito attractiveness ( Figure 5 A). Because IR co-receptor mutants showed significantly reduced attraction to humans, we focused our chemical analysis on acidic compounds, which are detected by the IR pathway ( Ai et al., 2010 4.

Raji, J.I. ∙ Melo, N. ∙ Castillo, J.S. ... Aedes aegypti mosquitoes detect acidic volatiles found in human odor using the IR8a pathway Curr. Biol. 2019; 29 :1253-1262.e7 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (115) PubMed Google Scholar ). We collected nylons from 7 of 8 human subjects in our initial subject cohort on 4 days spaced at least 1 week apart and then performed 4 independent analyses (experiments 1.1–1.4; Figure 5 B). Samples were derivatized with pentafluorobenzyl-bromide (PFB-Br) ( Figure S2 A) and analyzed using negative methane chemical ionization on a QTOF instrument, allowing formula prediction from the mass of detected ions.
Using unbiased feature detection and data filtering, we identified 204 molecular features that were enriched on subject nylons versus unworn nylons and method blanks, across all 4 experiments ( Table S1 ). High attractor subjects appeared to have more of these putative “human-derived” peaks overall than low attractor subjects ( Figure 5 C). Of these, ∼50 features were differentially present in samples from the two most attractive subjects, subjects 33 and 31, versus the two least attractive subjects, subjects 19 and 28, in all 4 replicate experiments ( Figures 5 D and 5E; Table S1 ). Nearly all differentially enriched features (49/51) were more abundant in the 2 highly attractive subjects, although we did find 2 features that were enriched in the 2 low attractors ( Figure 5 E). We were able to predict chemical formulas for about 40 of these features and ultimately identified 9 as straight-chain fatty acids by matching their mass and retention time to that of authentic standards ( Figure 5 E). We then extracted the signals for all the straight-chain acids with acyl chain lengths between 3 and 20 carbons ( Figure 5 F). Consistent with the untargeted analysis described above, these compounds were all low or absent in unworn nylons and solvent controls, but only fatty acids with >10 carbons appeared to be enriched in the most highly attractive subjects ( Figures 5 F and 5G; Figures S2 B and S2C). Several control compounds were similarly abundant in the high and the low attractor samples, including 2 deuterated internal standards present in the extraction solvent and an unknown “nylon-derived” entity that was present in all nylon containing samples, and absent in solvent-alone controls ( Figures S2 D and S2E).
To confirm our finding that highly mosquito-attracting humans produced more abundant carboxylic acids on their skin, we enrolled 56 new human subjects in a validation study ( Figure S4 A) and used the higher-throughput single-stimulus olfactometer assay to screen the attractiveness of nylons from a given new subject compared with an unworn nylon ( Figure 6 A). Alongside the 56 new subjects, we also tested nylons from 7 subjects from the initial cohort in this assay ( Figure 6 B). Consistent with our initial behavioral studies, performed over 1 year earlier, subject 28 was the least attractive of all 64 subjects tested over the course of the whole study, and subject 33 was among the most attractive ( Figures 1 F and 6 B). We moved 18 subjects (4 from the initial cohort and 14 from the validation cohort) forward to metabolite profiling with GC/QTOF-MS, comprising 11 highly attractive and 7 weakly attractive subjects. Subjects provided 4 more odor samples, spaced 1 week apart, that were used for additional behavioral testing to confirm their high/low attractor status, and for GC/QTOF-MS analysis. In Figure 6 B, we plot all data collected from the low and high attractor groups that were included in the GC/QTOF-MS analysis. Behavioral data from 45 additional subjects, 42 subjects from the validation cohort and three subjects from the initial cohort, who were not included in the GC/QTOF-MS validation study because of sample size limitations are available on Zenodo ( https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5822538 ).
We again performed 4 replicate metabolomic experiments ( Figure 6 C; experiments 2.1–2.4) and found 161 molecular features that were likely to be human-derived ( Table S1 ). We then filtered features that were differentially abundant in high versus low attractor groups in all 4 replicate experiments, resulting in a list of 13 features enriched in the high attractor group ( Figures 6 D and 6E). We identified 3 of these as pentadecanoic acid, heptadecanoic acid, and nonadecanoic acid ( Figure 6 E; Figure S3 C). We were not able to identify the remaining 10 features definitively, although in some cases, we were able to predict a chemical formula. Of note, many of these features had the same predicted formula as the identified straight-chain fatty acids but eluted at different retention times, making it likely these are branched chain isoforms of the identified carboxylic acids. Deuterated internal standards and a nylon-derived entity showed no difference in abundance between the high and low attractor groups ( Figures S3 A and S3B).
We next carried out a targeted re-analysis of carboxylic acids with 10–20 carbons in individual human subjects and control samples ( Figures 6 F–6H). The abundance of carboxylic acids on individual subjects from the initial cohort was remarkably consistent with results obtained about 1 year earlier. Low attractors subjects 19 and 28 had much lower levels of many carboxylic acids than high attractors subjects 31 and 33 ( Figures 5 F and 6 F; Figure S4 B). The carboxylic acid pattern was consistent from week to week for individual subjects in the larger cohort in experiments 2.1–2.4 ( Figure S4 C). Overall, the high attractor group had significantly higher levels of 3 carboxylic acids (pentadecanoic, heptadecanoic, and nonadecanoic) than the low attractor subjects in this targeted re-analysis of the data ( Figures 6 G and 6H). However, not all individual subjects fit this pattern. Low attractor subject 90 had high levels of all carboxylic acids examined, in contrast to the 6 other low attractors ( Figure 6 F). In both the initial and validation cohorts, we documented an association between high levels of skin carboxylic acids and attractiveness to mosquitoes.
To test the hypothesis that high attractors have higher levels of mosquito-attractant compounds on their skin, we performed a dose-response experiment, in which we competed different sized swatches of high attractor subject 33 nylon against a standard 7.62 × 10.16 cm-sized swatch of low attractor worn nylon from subject 19 or subject 28 ( Figure 7 ). We found that mosquitoes preferred the odor blend of high attractor subject 33 to that of both low attractor subjects, even when presented with a substantially smaller swatch of subject 33 nylon than the less attractive subject’s nylon ( Figure 7 ). Subject 33 nylon only became indistinguishable from low attractor nylons from subject 28 and subject 19 nylon, when competed against a swatch of subject 33 nylon that was 32-fold or 8-fold smaller, respectively ( Figure 7 ). Therefore, the skin odor blend of highly attractive subject 33 provided a much more potent attractive stimulus than that of weakly attractive humans, which is consistent with our GC/QTOF-MS findings that highly attractive subject nylons contained more human-derived compounds, including carboxylic acids, than those of less attractive subjects.

Section: Discussion

In this work, we establish that the differential attractiveness of individual humans to mosquitoes is stable over many months and is associated with the abundance of skin-associated carboxylic acids. This finding is consistent with the discovery that mice at a specific stage of infection with malaria parasites were more attractive to mosquitoes and that infected mice showed an overall increase in concentration of many emitted volatile compounds ( De Moraes et al., 2014 20. De Moraes, C.M. ∙ Stanczyk, N.M. ∙ Betz, H.S. ... Malaria-induced changes in host odors enhance mosquito attraction Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111 :11079-11084 Crossref Scopus (119) PubMed Google Scholar ). Highly attractive subjects produced significantly higher levels of three carboxylic acids—pentadecanoic, heptadecanoic, and nonadecanoic acids—as well as 10 unidentified compounds in this same chemical class. The specific blend of these and other carboxylic acids varied between different high attractive subjects. Therefore, there may be more than one way for a person to be highly attractive to mosquitoes. We did not identify any compounds that were reproducibly enriched on the skin of the least attractive humans, consistent with the idea that these individuals lack mosquito attractants, rather than emitting a shared set of repellent compounds. A previous study that analyzed inter-individual differences in mosquito attractiveness focused on different classes of compounds and identified five—6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, octanal, nonanal, decanal, and geranylacetone—that were enriched on the skin of weakly attractive humans ( Logan et al., 2008 46. Logan, J.G. ∙ Birkett, M.A. ∙ Clark, S.J. ... Identification of human-derived volatile chemicals that interfere with attraction of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes J. Chem. Ecol. 2008; 34 :308-322 Crossref Scopus (191) PubMed Google Scholar ). Individually, these compounds reduced mosquito flight activity and/or attraction, suggesting that some people may release natural repellents that make them less attractive to mosquitoes. One of our subjects, subject 90, had high levels of carboxylic acids in their skin emanations but was only weakly attractive to mosquitoes. It is plausible that subject 90 produces higher levels of a natural repellent that would counteract the elevated levels of carboxylic acids, but this was not tested in our study.
Our behavioral assay results corroborate anecdotal evidence that context matters for how attractive a person is to mosquitoes in a real-world setting, since mosquitoes feed opportunistically. If one human walks into a highly mosquito-infested environment alone, they may receive many bites, regardless of their overall attractiveness level because they are the only feeding option. Mosquito preferences matter more in group settings. The “mosquito magnet” in the group may receive the most bites, leaving the less attractive humans largely untouched. This suggests that mosquitoes distinguish the scent of two human samples using cues that exist along a continuum. We propose that exceptionally high or low attractiveness to mosquitoes is a “fixed” trait, caused by factors that remain constant over a period of several years, even when environmental factors are not strictly controlled. It has been shown that identical twins are more similarly attractive to mosquitoes than fraternal twins ( Fernández-Grandon et al., 2015 24. Fernández-Grandon, G.M. ∙ Gezan, S.A. ∙ Armour, J.A. ... Heritability of attractiveness to mosquitoes PLOS One. 2015; 10 :e0122716 Crossref Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting a genetic component to mosquito attractiveness. Moreover, the blend of carboxylic acids that characterizes individual human body odor types is more similar in monozygotic twins than unrelated subjects ( Kuhn and Natsch, 2009 41. Kuhn, F. ∙ Natsch, A. Body odour of monozygotic human twins: a common pattern of odorant carboxylic acids released by a bacterial aminoacylase from axilla secretions contributing to an inherited body odour type J. R. Soc. Interface. 2009; 6 :377-392 Crossref Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ). We speculate that genetically determined skin characteristics and/or other very stable inter-individual differences contribute to making someone highly or weakly attractive to mosquitoes.
Because no single mutation of Ir8a , Ir76b , Ir25a , or Orco was able to disrupt the ability of mosquitoes to discriminate between two subjects, we speculate that there is extensive redundancy in the detection of human-derived skin odors. This may be due to central olfactory coding mechanisms or to the recently described co-expression of ORs and IRs in the same olfactory sensory neuron ( Herre et al., 2022 32. Herre, M. ∙ Goldman, O.V. ∙ Lu, T.C. ... Non-canonical odor coding in the mosquito Cell. 2022; 185 :3104-3123.e28 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ; Task et al., 2022 76. Task, D. ∙ Lin, C.C. ∙ Vulpe, A. ... Chemoreceptor co-expression in Drosophila melanogaster olfactory neurons eLife. 2022; 11 :e72599 Crossref Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ). One possible mechanism of IR redundancy could lie with their use of three and not one co-receptor as for the OR system. Removing any one IR co-receptor might have only a partial effect on the ability of the mosquito to detect odorants sensed by IRs. One possibility is that the three IR co-receptors together with ligand-selective IRs collaborate to tile the chemical space of carboxylic acids, such that removing any single IR co-receptor reduces the overall attraction to humans but allows the mutants to retain the ability to detect differences in levels of carboxylic acids. Our findings argue against the idea that mosquitoes distinguish between highly and weakly attractive humans using a single odor, such as lactic acid, as has been suggested ( Acree et al., 1968 3. Acree, Jr., F. ∙ Turner, R.B. ∙ Gouck, H.K. ... L-lactic acid: a mosquito attractant isolated from humans Science. 1968; 161 :1346-1347 Crossref Scopus (180) PubMed Google Scholar ). If this were the case, we would expect that Ir8a mutants, which cannot sense lactic acid ( Raji et al., 2019 65. Raji, J.I. ∙ Melo, N. ∙ Castillo, J.S. ... Aedes aegypti mosquitoes detect acidic volatiles found in human odor using the IR8a pathway Curr. Biol. 2019; 29 :1253-1262.e7 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (115) PubMed Google Scholar ), would lose their preference for highly attractive humans. Instead, we propose that “mosquito magnets” produce elevated levels of multiple mosquito-attractant compounds and that this drives mosquito preferences.
Humans have more abundant free fatty acids on their skin surface than non-human animals ( Nicolaides et al., 1968 56. Nicolaides, N. ∙ Fu, H.C. ∙ Rice, G.R. The skin surface lipids of man compared with those of eighteen species of animals J. Invest. Dermatol. 1968; 51 :83-89 Full Text (PDF) Scopus (134) PubMed Google Scholar ), and these may signal to mosquitoes that there is a human nearby. Human skin is unique among mammals because it has relatively little hair and has numerous eccrine sweat glands across most of its surface. Some animals, including humans, produce a specialized waxy substance from sebaceous glands called sebum. In humans, sebum is triglyceride-rich, producing a characteristic surface lipid composition that contains about 25% free fatty acids ( Nicolaides et al., 1968 56. Nicolaides, N. ∙ Fu, H.C. ∙ Rice, G.R. The skin surface lipids of man compared with those of eighteen species of animals J. Invest. Dermatol. 1968; 51 :83-89 Full Text (PDF) Scopus (134) PubMed Google Scholar ). This is thought to have protective effects, such as limiting sun damage in the absence of protective hair and emulsifying eccrine sweat, preventing its overly rapid evaporation to regulate body temperature ( Huang et al., 2009 34. Huang, Z.R. ∙ Lin, Y.K. ∙ Fang, J.Y. Biological and pharmacological activities of squalene and related compounds: potential uses in cosmetic dermatology Molecules. 2009; 14 :540-554 Crossref Scopus (349) PubMed Google Scholar ; Nicolaides, 1974 55. Nicolaides, N. Skin lipids: their biochemical uniqueness Science. 1974; 186 :19-26 Crossref Scopus (491) PubMed Google Scholar ). Human skin acids are astonishingly diverse, with branched, odd-chain, and esterified fatty acids reported, along with skin-specific patterns of desaturation ( Nicolaides, 1974 55. Nicolaides, N. Skin lipids: their biochemical uniqueness Science. 1974; 186 :19-26 Crossref Scopus (491) PubMed Google Scholar ). Given the vast array of acid types found on the skin, it is unlikely that two individual humans will possess the same exact complement of acids in the exact same ratios, potentially giving each human a unique chemical signature. Skin bacteria contribute to the pool of free fatty acids found on human skin by producing several types of fatty acid synthetase enzymes that allow them to produce diverse types of acids themselves ( Kaneda, 1991 36. Kaneda, T. Iso- and anteiso-fatty acids in bacteria: biosynthesis, function, and taxonomic significance Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55 :288-302 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Lu et al., 2004 48. Lu, Y.J. ∙ Zhang, Y.M. ∙ Rock, C.O. Product diversity and regulation of type II fatty acid synthases Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 82 :145-155 Crossref Scopus (134) PubMed Google Scholar ) and by cleaving free fatty acids from human sebum triglycerides using lipase enzymes ( Nicolaides et al., 1968 56. Nicolaides, N. ∙ Fu, H.C. ∙ Rice, G.R. The skin surface lipids of man compared with those of eighteen species of animals J. Invest. Dermatol. 1968; 51 :83-89 Full Text (PDF) Scopus (134) PubMed Google Scholar ). Additionally, recent work has shown that skin microbiota composition is remarkably stable within an individual over time, although skin is exposed to a constantly fluctuating environment ( Oh et al., 2016 58. Oh, J. ∙ Byrd, A.L. ∙ Park, M. ..., NISC Comparative Sequencing Program Temporal stability of the human skin microbiome Cell. 2016; 165 :854-866 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (650) PubMed Google Scholar ). Most viable skin bacteria reside in the pores, where they are protected from external factors, such as hygiene habits and seasonal weather changes ( Acosta et al., 2021 2. Acosta, E.M. ∙ Little, K.A. ∙ Bratton, B.P. ... Bacterial DNA on the skin surface overrepresents the viable skin microbiome 2021 Preprint at bioRxiv Crossref Google Scholar ). It is reasonable to think that an individual’s skin microbiota contributes to their skin acid composition, which we have shown to be remarkably stable over time.
We have identified an association between skin carboxylic acid abundance and attractiveness of individual humans to mosquitoes. It is important to note that our results do not allow us to conclude that skin carboxylic acid abundance directly causes specific humans to be highly attractive to mosquitoes. Demonstrating causality would require establishing necessity and sufficiency of these substances for mosquito magnetics. However, we are unaware of a method to specifically remove carboxylic acids from the skin of highly attractive human subjects to establish necessity. One could establish sufficiency by supplementing the skin odor of weakly attractive human subjects with specific carboxylic acids, provided in naturalistic ratios to the other components of the human odor blend. Our study found 13 molecular “features” enriched on nylons worn by high attractors, but we were only able to identify three of these definitively. We reason that it would not be informative to spike a small subset of the enriched compounds onto low attractor nylons. Human skin odor is a complex blend of several classes of chemical compounds, each of which requires its own specialized analytical detection methods. Our study exclusively focused on compounds with carboxylic acid groups. We have not exhaustively cataloged all human skin metabolites that differ between humans of varying attractiveness to mosquitoes. Thus, we cannot rule out the possibility that other types of compounds not detected by our methods may contribute to differences in human attractiveness to mosquitoes. Notably, the carboxylic acids we identified are not especially volatile. Hence, it is unclear whether they are important for differential mosquito attraction to humans across long distances. It is possible that the compounds we identified may give rise to more volatile components that are also enriched on the skin of “mosquito-magnet” subjects but which were not found in our study due to the analytical methods used.
The attraction preferences of disease-vectoring mosquitoes have important public health implications, since it is estimated that in disease-endemic areas a small fraction of humans is more frequently targeted, and these individuals serve as a reservoir of pathogens ( Harrington et al., 2014 31. Harrington, L.C. ∙ Fleisher, A. ∙ Ruiz-Moreno, D. ... Heterogeneous feeding patterns of the dengue vector, Aedes aegypti , on individual human hosts in rural Thailand PLOS Negl. Trop. Dis. 2014; 8 :e3048 Crossref Scopus (88) PubMed Google Scholar ; Muirhead-Thomson, 1951 52. Muirhead-Thomson, R.C. The distribution of anopheline mosquito bites among different age groups; a new factor in malaria epidemiology Br. Med. J. 1951; 1 :1114-1117 Crossref Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, recent work has shown that flavivirus infections alter the microbiome of humans and make them more attractive to mosquitoes ( Zhang et al., 2022 84. Zhang, H. ∙ Zhu, Y. ∙ Liu, Z. ... A volatile from the skin microbiota of Flavivirus-infected hosts promotes mosquito attractiveness Cell. 2022; 185 :2510-2522.e2516 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (43) Google Scholar ). Understanding the mechanistic basis for mosquito biting preferences will suggest ways to reduce mosquito attraction to humans and curb the spread of dangerous arboviruses.

USA. 2018; 115 :E4209-E4218 Crossref Scopus (110) PubMed Google Scholar ) and mice ( De Moraes et al., 2014 20. De Moraes, C.M. ∙ Stanczyk, N.M. ∙ Betz, H.S. ... Malaria-induced changes in host odors enhance mosquito attraction Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111 :11079-11084 Crossref Scopus (119) PubMed Google Scholar ) have demonstrated that malaria infection enhances human attractiveness to mosquitoes by altering the chemistry of human skin odor, leading to greater pathogen transmission. Understanding what makes someone a “mosquito magnet” will suggest ways to rationally design interventions such as skin microbiota manipulation to make people less attractive to mosquitoes. We propose that the ability to predict which individuals in a community are high attractors would allow for more effective deployment of resources to combat the spread of mosquito-borne pathogens.

Blood-feeding procedures and mosquito behavior with live human hosts were approved and monitored by The Rockefeller University Institutional Review Board (IRB protocol LVO-0652) and the Rockefeller University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC protocol 20068-H). Human subjects gave their written informed consent to participate in this study.
All subjects who participated in our studies were selected solely based on their availability and willingness to participate in frequent nylon wearing experiments. The initial cohort of 8 subjects was recruited from scientists working in or nearby the Vosshall lab. Over several months, as we collected the nylon preference dataset shown in Figure 1 E, we noticed that Subject 33 and Subject 28 and were exceptionally attractive and unattractive, respectively, so we decided to specifically examine whether mosquitoes preferred the actual forearm of Subject 33 to that of Subject 28 ( Figure 1 B). Subject 25 was included in these experiments as a “moderate/average” attractor for comparison.
64 healthy human subjects participated in this study. Age at inception of study on 12/7/2017: mean 29.8, median 29, range 19-57 years. Self-identified gender: 37 female, 26 male, 1 non-binary. Due to sample size limitations, we intentionally did not subdivide these groups further to investigate the contribution of demographic factors such as sex, age, and ethnicity, or behavioral factors such as diet, personal care, or activity levels on mosquito attractiveness, which we determined empirically. The behavior experiments in Figures 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 7 included only subjects from the initial cohort (Subjects 19, 24, 25, 28, 30, 31, 32, 33). Seven of these subjects were tested in GC/QTOF-MS Experiments 1.1–1.4 in Figure 5 . Subject 24 had moved away before we performed the experiments in Figures 4 , 5 and 6 . These 7 subjects from the initial cohort (Subjects 19, 25, 28, 30, 31, 32, 33) were also analyzed about a year later alongside 56 newly recruited subjects ( Figure 6 B). The full single stimulus olfactometer behavior dataset for all 63 subjects is available on Zenodo ( https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5822538 ), including data for the 18 subjects whose data are plotted in Figure 6 B, comprising 4 subjects from the initial cohort (Subjects 19, 28, 31, and 33) and 14 subjects from the validation cohort. These 18 subjects were selected for inclusion in GC/QTOF-MS Experiments 2.1–2.4, based on their overall level of attractiveness to mosquitoes in initial screening experiments (a subset of the data presented in Figure 6 B, and their availability to participate in additional behavior and GC/QTOF-MS experiments.
Aedes aegypti wild-type laboratory strains (Orlando and Liverpool) were reared in an environmental room maintained at 70-80% relative humidity and 25-28°C, as previously described ( DeGennaro et al., 2013 22. DeGennaro, M. ∙ McBride, C.S. ∙ Seeholzer, L. ... orco mutant mosquitoes lose strong preference for humans and are not repelled by volatile DEET Nature. 2013; 498 :487-491 Crossref Scopus (319) PubMed Google Scholar ). All animals were maintained with a photoperiod of 14 hours light: 10 hours dark throughout larval, pupal, and adult life stages. Adult mosquitoes were provided constant access to 10% sucrose. Female mosquitoes were fasted for 14-24 hours without sucrose in the presence of water prior to behavioral experiments. For stock maintenance, females were blood fed on live mice.
Ir25a and Ir76b mutants were generated using methods described previously ( Kistler et al., 2015 38. Kistler, K.E. ∙ Vosshall, L.B. ∙ Matthews, B.J. Genome engineering with CRISPR-Cas9 in the mosquito Aedes aegypti Cell Rep. 2015; 11 :51-60 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (276) PubMed Google Scholar ). sgRNA sequences were designed with the CRISPOR v4.3 sgRNA design tool ( http://crispor.tefor.net/ ) ( Concordet and Haeussler, 2018 19. Concordet, J.P. ∙ Haeussler, M. CRISPOR: intuitive guide selection for CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing experiments and screens. Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46 :W242-W245 Crossref Scopus (962) PubMed Google Scholar ) using the following parameters: Genome, Aedes aegypti – yellow fever mosquito – NCBI GCF_002204515.2 (AaegL5.0); Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM), 20bp-NGG - Sp Cas9, SpCas9-HF1, eSpCas9 1.1. For each gene, two pairs of sgRNA with predicted MIT Specificity Scores ≥95 were selected for targeted double stranded break-induced mutagenesis, with each pair flanking roughly 250 base pairs within exon 2 for Ir76b and exons 2 and 3 for Ir25a . sgRNA DNA templates were prepared by annealing oligonucleotides as previously described using the following target sequences: Ir25a-sgRNA1: GTTGAGCTACTAACCGTCGA Ir25a-sgRNA2: TACTGACAGCAAAGGGCTGT Ir25a-sgRNA3: CCTACGGTTTCCGCATCAAC Ir25a-sgRNA4: AAGAAGGCGACTTGAGGCAA Ir76b-sgRNA1: GTTACACCGAACGTCAGAA Ir76b-sgRNA2: TACTCTGGTCGGACGCGGTG Ir76b-sgRNA3: CTCCTTTCAATCGGGACGTG Ir76b-sgRNA4: CAACGGCCAGCAGCGATACC
In vitro transcription was performed using HiScribe Quick T7 kit (NEB E2050S) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Following in vitro transcription and DNAse treatment for 15 minutes at 37 o C, sgRNA was purified using RNAse-free SPRI beads (Ampure RNAclean, Beckman-Coulter A63987), and eluted in Ultrapure water (Invitrogen, 10977–015). To further facilitate isolation of loss-of-function mutants, 200 bp single-stranded DNA oligodeoxynucleotide (ssODN) donors were designed as a template for homology-directed repair ( Kistler et al., 2015 38. Kistler, K.E. ∙ Vosshall, L.B. ∙ Matthews, B.J. Genome engineering with CRISPR-Cas9 in the mosquito Aedes aegypti Cell Rep. 2015; 11 :51-60 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (276) PubMed Google Scholar ). The ssODN donor had homology arms of 88–90 bases on either side of the inner most sgRNA target sites (sgRNA2 and sgRNA3 for both Ir25a and Ir76b ), flanking an insert with stop codons in all three frames of translation and a BamHI restriction site (IDT). Since homology arms contained sgRNA target sites for the outer most sgRNA target sites (sgRNA1 and sgRNA4 for both Ir25a and Ir76b ), PAM motifs for the respective sgRNAs were mutated to avoid ssODN donor cleavage. The sequences for each ssODN follow below with left and right homology arms italicized, stop codons underlined, and BamHI restriction site highlighted in bold: Ir25a-ssODN: TTGCGCTGAACTATATAAGAAAGAACCCAAGCCTCGGACTTTCAGTTGAGCTACTAACCGTCGAATGAAACCGTACTGACAGCAAAGGGC TAATAA GGATCC A TAA C TAA GG AACCGGCCAAGAAGGCGACTTGAGGCAATAGCGATCTCTATCAAACGTAAAAAGCAACTATCTGTTGCAGGTTTGCTACAAAACTTTA Ir76b-ssODN: TCTAATTGCATCGAACTCTCTTTCCCACGTTCAACAGGACTGGCCGCTGAGTTACACCGAACGTCAGAATAGTACTCTGGTCGGACGCG TAATAA GGATCC A TAA C TAA GG GTGTGGATTTTGATTCTGGTATCGCTGCTGGCCGTTGGTCCAATCATCTACGGAATGCTGATTGTGCGGTACAAAATGACCAAAGACAA
For each target gene, approximately 500 wild-type Aedes aegypti (Liverpool LVP strain) embryos were injected with a mixture containing recombinant Cas9 protein (PNA Bio, CP01) at 300 ng/μl, 4 sgRNAs at 40 ng/μl each, and donor ssODN at 125 ng/μl. Embryos were injected by the Insect Transformation Facility at the University of Maryland Institute for Bioscience & Biotechnology Research. Embryos were hatched and G0 females were crossed to wild-type Liverpool males, and their G1 offspring were screened for germline mutation by PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing the regions flanking the sgRNA target sites. Two unique stable mutant lines, each resulting in an early stop codon due to a frameshift mutation, were isolated from each injection. For Ir25a , one isolated mutant line had a 160-bp deletion with an ssODN integration ( Ir25a BamHI ), and the other had a 19-bp deletion ( Ir25a 19 ). For Ir76b , one isolated mutant line had a 61-bp deletion ( Ir76b 61 ), and the other had a 32-bp deletion ( Ir76b 32 ). Virgin females from each mutant line were backcrossed to wild-type Liverpool males for 8 generations prior to establishment of stable homozygous lines. To control for potential CRISPR-Cas9 off-target effects on behavior, homozygous mutant lines were intercrossed to generate heteroallelic mutants that were tested in all behavior experiments alongside appropriate genetic controls. It was previously shown that although Ir76b mutant Anopheles coluzzii females show normal attraction to human host cues, they fail to blood feed and therefore produce no offspring ( Ye et al., 2022 82. Ye, Z. ∙ Liu, F. ∙ Sun, H. ... Discrete roles of Ir76b ionotropic coreceptor impact olfaction, blood feeding, and mating in the malaria vector mosquito Anopheles coluzzii Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2022; 119 e2112385119 Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar ). We also observed deficits in blood-feeding and egg-laying in homozygous Aedes aegypti Ir25a and Ir76b strains, albeit far less severe than the Anopheles coluzzii Ir76b mutants. All homozygous Ir25a and Ir76b mutant strains were maintained by blood-feeding on a human arm. We determined empirically that these mutant mosquitoes fed more avidly when they were 14 days post eclosion, rather than 7 days, which is the standard timepoint at which we blood feed to propagate other strains. These strains did not feed effectively on live mice or on an artificial membrane blood feeder. A volunteer inserted an arm into a standard BugDorm rearing cage (30 cm 3 ) cage for 30 minutes at ambient temp/humidity. These cages contained a mixed population of males and females, which had been allowed to mate freely since eclosion. Mosquitoes had access to the entire hand and forearm of the subject. For context, normal strains feed to repletion on a human arm after 5-10 minutes, even when the arm is placed outside of the cage netting and not inside the cage. Feeding of these mutants was unsuccessful when the human arm was placed against the netting on the outside of the cage. About 50% of females were engorged at the end of a given 30-minute feeding session, while the rest were partially fed or unfed. Notably, a given female took much longer to probe the arm repeatedly before successfully feeding. No attempt was made to refeed females that did not feed during a given 30-minute feeding session. Four days after feeding, an oviposition cup was placed into the cage and as many eggs as possible were collected over a 4-day period. After this stage the entire process was repeated once or twice with the same cage to obtain enough eggs to propagate the strains and carry out experiments. It is our impression that Ir25a females but not Ir76b females laid fewer eggs than wild type, but we did not investigate this further in the course of this study. Unlike the observed difficulties with the homozygous mutants, heterozygous mutants fed normally and laid normal numbers of eggs.
Genotypes were confirmed using Phire Tissue Direct PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher, F170L) followed by gel electrophoresis and Sanger sequencing (Genewiz) using the following primer combination for each mutant allele: Ir25a BamHI , Ir25a 19 Forward: AATACTTGAGGAGTCGTTGAAT Reverse: GAAGCAATGCCTTGTACTTATG Ir76b 61 Forward: AGCCGAATATGAAGGTCAAGC Reverse: CAGCACCTGTTCCTTGTCTT Ir76b 32 Forward: TGCATCGAACTCTCTTTCCC Reverse: CGATAGCTAAGATGCCAGTACAT
The Ir25a BamHI allele was detected by either a 160 bp deletion or presence of an exogenous BamHI restriction site from the donor ssODN. BamHI restriction digest of the PCR product generated a single 764 bp fragment in wild-type animals and two fragments (275 bp and 329 bp) in the Ir25a BamHI mutant. For mutants with small deletions, the presence or absence of endogenous restriction enzyme target sites was used to distinguish between mutant and wild-type alleles. PCR products were generated and digested with the indicated enzyme, producing the indicated bands in mutant and wild type: Ir25a 19 with MspI Wild type: 502 and 262 bp; Ir25a 19 : 764 bp Ir76b 61 with BstUI Wild type: 367 and 397 bp; Ir76b 61 : 764 bp Ir76b 32 with BstNI Wild type: 392 and 365bp; Ir76b 61 : 757 bp
All genotyping experiments were performed with a no DNA control as well as fragment size validation using 1Kb Plus DNA ladder (ThermoFisher Scientific, 10787026). See Figure S1 .
Given the severe host-seeking and blood-feeding deficits displayed by Ir25a and Ir76b female homozygous mutants, it is difficult to maintain these as homozygous strains. For the benefit of scientists wishing to work with these new strains, we have devised a crossing scheme that uses heterozygous mutant females to propagate the mutant alleles. An important aspect of this approach is that Ir25a and Ir76b mutants do not carry a fluorescent marker at their respective gene loci. This strategy consists of first crossing homozygous Ir25a or Ir76b mutant males to heterozygous females from the corresponding Ir25a-QF2 and Ir76b-QF2 gene-sparing knock-in driver lines ( Herre et al., 2022 32. Herre, M. ∙ Goldman, O.V. ∙ Lu, T.C. ... Non-canonical odor coding in the mosquito Cell. 2022; 185 :3104-3123.e28 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ). These strains contain the 3xP3-dsRed marker integrated at the Ir25a or Ir76b genetic locus. This initial cross will generate both fluorescent and non-fluorescent heterozygous mutants at a 1:1 ratio. Then, taking the fluorescent heterozygous mutant females, these animals will again be crossed to the homozygous mutant males. This cross will generate non-fluorescent homozygous mutants and fluorescent heterozygous mutants at a 1:1 ratio. At this point, mutant alleles can easily be maintained by collecting eggs from the cross between non-fluorescent homozygous mutant males with fluorescent heterozygous females isolated at each generation. Since the mutations and the locations of the inserted fluorescent markers are tightly linked, we expect the recombination rates between the mutation sites and the markers to be extremely rare. However, occasional genotyping is recommended to ensure proper propagation of each of the mutant alleles.
Human subjects washed their forearms with Dove unscented soap and water, dried them with clean laboratory paper towels, and then wore nylons sleeves on both forearms between the wrist and elbow for 6 hours. Nylon sleeves were prepared by using scissors to remove 5.08 cm of fabric from the tip of the stocking foot of knee highs (L’eggs brand Everyday, Amazon), so that the modified stocking was open on both ends. Subjects wore 2 nylon sleeves on each arm: a brown experimental nylon was worn next to the skin, and a black outer nylon was placed over the experimental nylon to minimize contamination of the inner nylon. Subjects wore nylons during the day and were allowed to perform typical daytime activities but were asked not to exercise or drink alcohol while wearing the nylons. After the 6-hour wearing period, nylons were deposited in Whirl-Pak bags and kept at -20 o C for 1-10 days before behavioral and chemical analysis. For the “round-robin” two-choice assay experiment in Figure 1 E, we competed 2 nylon sleeves that had been worn on the same day by 2 different human subjects, to strictly control the “age” of the nylons being used to determine if mosquitoes preferred one subject over the other. We relaxed the requirement that subjects wear the nylons on the same day for subsequent two-choice assay experiments, since small differences in nylon age did not change the preference of mosquitoes for specific human subjects. In Figures 2 , 4 and 7 , we compared nylons that had been worn within 2 days of each other by two different subjects. This allowed us to better accommodate the schedules of human subjects, who were not always available on the same day over the extended duration of the study.
The single choice olfactometer assay referred to in this work ( Figures 3 C and 6 B) is the same assay previously referred to as the “Quattroport” in an earlier publication ( Basrur et al., 2020 7. Basrur, N.S. ∙ De Obaldia, M.E. ∙ Morita, T. ... Fruitless mutant male mosquitoes gain attraction to human odor eLife. 2020; 9 :e63982 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), because the assay allows 4 independent single stimulus olfactometer trials to be run in parallel. In this work, we refer to the Quattroport assay as the “single stimulus olfactometer assay” to avoid confusion about the number of stimuli being presented to each group of mosquitoes in a single trial. We repurposed components of the Quattroport assay to create the two-choice olfactometer assay, which allows us to compete 2 different stimuli against each other in the same trial. We performed two separate preference trials in parallel, increasing throughput over the Gouck olfactometer assay ( Gouck, 1972 29. Gouck, H.K. Host preferences of various strains of Aedes aegypti and A. simpsoni as determined by an olfactometer Bull. World Health Organ. 1972; 47 :680-683 PubMed Google Scholar ). Details of fabrication and operation of the two-choice assay are available on Zenodo ( https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5822538 ). Air flow and CO 2 conditions for the two-choice olfactometer assay were carried out as described for the Quattroport ( Basrur et al., 2020 7. Basrur, N.S. ∙ De Obaldia, M.E. ∙ Morita, T. ... Fruitless mutant male mosquitoes gain attraction to human odor eLife. 2020; 9 :e63982 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Human forearm-worn nylon sleeves were used as the stimulus in all behavior figures with the two-choice olfactometer assay, except Figure 1 B in which human subjects placed their forearm over a hole in the stimulus box lid, exposing 12.9 cm 2 of skin to mosquitoes (demonstrated with a mannequin arm in Figure 1 A). We shuffled the order in which different stimuli were assessed over the course of the day, and we randomized the position of different stimuli across all stimulus boxes of the assays, to reduce time of day and position effects. All behavioral experiments were carried out in an environmental room set to 25 o C, 70-80% relative humidity. The day before behavior was measured, 20 female mosquitoes (aged 7-14 days post-eclosion, mated) were sorted under cold anesthesia into each start canister and given access only to water for 18-22 hours. The same canisters were used for the single stimulus and two-choice assays. However, twice as many females were tested in each two-choice assay trial (40 females per trial, 20 in each of 2 canisters) as in each single stimulus trial (20 females per trial). In both assays, mosquitoes were acclimated to a carbon-filtered air stream for 10 minutes (Donaldson Ultrac-A). CO 2 was then introduced into the air stream for 30 seconds, at which point mosquitoes were released, and given 5 minutes to assess the stimulus or stimuli. Mosquitoes were prevented from contacting stimuli by a mesh divider. Sliding doors between assay compartments allow the experimenter to count the number of mosquitoes that were not activated, or activated but not attracted, or both activated and attracted to the stimulus. In the single stimulus assay, mosquitoes that entered an attraction trap were scored as attracted to the stimulus. In the two-choice assay, mosquitoes that entered a cylindrical flying tube or the adjacent trap, both downwind of the stimulus, were scored as attracted to that stimulus. In both assays, all mosquitoes that left the start canister were scored as activated. We are confident that mosquitoes use olfactory information to detect nylon stimuli, since mosquitoes cannot contact or taste the nylon in our assays due to the presence of a mesh barrier, and there are no visual cues that differentiate nylons worn by different subjects.
Between trials, the assay apparatus was vacuumed to remove live and dead mosquitoes, and air was flowed through the assay for 5-10 minutes to flush out residual CO 2 and odor. Two-choice assay parts were cleaned before use in every experiment, as described below. In some cases, assay parts needed to be cleaned between trials, so that they could be re-used during the same behavior experiment. Whenever possible, we constructed enough replicate assay parts to reduce the need to wash parts between trials, which slows down assay throughput. Experimenters always wore gloves when cleaning and handling clean assay parts. Detailed procedures are described here for how and when we cleaned each part of the two-choice assay (going from left to right in the schematic in Figure 1 A: 1) start canisters, 3D-printed connector joints, and accompanying acrylic sliding doors were washed in a dishwasher (Miele Optimal Series dishwasher, Cascade Original “Actionpacs” detergent pods) at least 2 days before behavior and allowed to air dry completely before female mosquitoes were loaded into the canisters on the day before behavior; 2) the flying box was too big to be washed in the sink or dishwasher, so the inside of the box was sprayed down with 70% ethanol from a laboratory spray bottle and this was wiped down with laboratory paper towels, and allowed to air dry; 3) two cylindrical flying tubes were washed in the dishwasher as described above and allowed to air dry; 4) Acrylic stands that support the cylindrical flying tubes were washed in the dishwasher as described above; 5) the complete supply of attraction traps and accompanying 3D printed joins and acrylic sliding doors was washed in the dishwasher as described above at least one day before the experiment and allowed to air dry. When we performed more trials than we had traps available, we hand washed the traps used in the first few trials using hot water and soap (Bac Down Handsoap, Decon Labs, Inc., Catalog #: 7001), and allowed them to air dry before re-using them in trials later in the day. 6) For stimulus boxes and lids, the cleaning procedure was the same as that for the traps. The complete supply of stimulus boxes and lids was washed in the dishwasher as described above at least one day before the experiment and allowed to air dry. When we performed more trials than we had stimulus boxes available, we hand washed the stimulus boxes used in the first few trials using hot water and soap and allowed them to air dry before re-using them in trials later in the day. 7) The 3D printed stop piece which connects the air/CO 2 supply to the stimulus box was wiped down with 70% ethanol that had been sprayed onto a laboratory paper towel before the first trial, and between every trial. Similarly, the single stimulus olfactometer assay parts were cleaned before every experiment. This means that, going from left to right in the schematic in Figure 3 C: 1) start canisters, 3D-printed connector joints, and accompanying acrylic sliding doors were washed in a dishwasher at least 2 days before behavior and allowed to air dry completely before female mosquitoes were loaded into the canisters on the day before behavior; 2) the two cylindrical flying tubes were hand washed in the sink with hot water and soap and a bottle brush (Dr. Brown’s, Amazon, ASIN: B01NCUKCC0), and allowed to air dry; 3) Acrylic stands that support the cylindrical flying tubes were washed in the dishwasher as described above; 4) the complete supply of attraction traps and accompanying 3D printed joins and acrylic sliding doors was washed in the dishwasher as described above at least one day before the experiment and allowed to air dry. When we performed more trials than we had traps available, we hand washed the traps used in the first few trials using hot water and soap and allowed them to air dry before re-using them in trials later in the day. 5) For stimulus boxes and lids, the cleaning procedure was the same as that for the traps. The complete supply of stimulus boxes and lids was washed in the dishwasher as described above at least one day before the experiment and allowed to air dry. When we performed more trials than we had stimulus boxes available, we hand washed the stimulus boxes used in the first few trials using hot water and soap and allowed them to air dry before re-using them in trials later in the day. 6) The 3D printed stop piece that connects the air/CO 2 supply to the stimulus box was wiped down with 70% ethanol that had been sprayed onto a laboratory paper towel before the first trial, and between every trial.
Two-choice olfactometer assay data indicating the overall percent mosquito activation and attraction in response to a single human subject stimulus, are presented in Figures 2 B, 2C, and 4 A for all control trials performed (i.e. all trials examining Subject 25 vs Subject 25, before the application of any inclusion criteria). In Figures 2 E, 2F, and 4 B, we report the percent of control trials that met the inclusion criteria used in later parts of these Figures, which required that there were: 1) at least 30 live mosquitoes at the end of the assay and 2) at least 10 mosquitoes attracted to either stimulus. We chose these inclusion criteria because IR mutants displayed large defects in overall attraction to human subjects, and we wished to examine preferences specifically using trials which passed a minimal threshold of overall attraction to human odor. Trials with very low overall attraction to either stimulus, could give misleading results, because they are subject to “jackpotting” effects. For example, if 2 mosquitoes were attracted to Subject A, and 1 mosquito was attracted to Subject B, this is not a meaningful difference in preference, so we would exclude this trial for having <10 animals attracted to either subject. To assay mosquito preferences between genotypes in Figures 2 G–2J and 4 C–4E, we present only trials that passed the inclusion criteria. We discarded trials in which substantially fewer mosquitoes were loaded into the assay (unintentionally), and which very few mosquitoes (<10) were attracted to either stimulus. There were some exceptions to the application of inclusion criteria, described here: the experiment in Figure 1 C compared mosquito preferences between several stimulus pairs that were expected to (and did) result in very low levels of attraction. These stimuli were: 1) unworn nylons versus no stimulus, and 2) no stimulus versus no stimulus. For this experiment, we did not require that more than 10 mosquitoes were attracted to either stimulus. We only required that there were >30 live animals at the end of the trial. For single stimulus olfactometer experiments ( Figures 3 D–3G and 6 B), we included trials with >14 live mosquitoes at the end of the trial.
For human odor host-seeking assays, a 7.62 cm x 10.16 cm piece of the brown experimental nylon was cut and used as a stimulus in either the two-choice olfactometer assay or the single stimulus olfactometer assay. This was the largest size of material that could be laid flat on the bottom of the stimulus boxes used in both assays. By using this size of nylon stimulus, we could cut three pieces of nylon from each nylon sleeve, yielding a total of 6 pieces of nylons from each day of nylon wearing, or enough for 6 trials of that subject. Experimenters always handled nylon sleeves with gloves and cleaned scissors with 70% ethanol between samples. Subjects wore 2 nylon sleeves on each of their 2 forearms (one brown experimental nylon next to their skin, covered by one black protective nylon, as described above). We asked subjects to remove both nylon sleeves they wore on each arm as a single “unit” (keeping the black protective nylon outside the brown experimental nylon) and to place these in a Whirl-Pak bag (Nasco, Catalog #: B01062) in the freezer. This allowed us to determine which side of the brown experimental nylon had touched the subject’s skin (the side that was not touching the black outer nylon), and we marked this side with a fine point permanent marker. The side of the nylon that touched the subject’s skin was placed facing upwards in the stimulus box, to ensure consistency between trials. In all behavior experiments, nylon samples were de-identified before being cut and presented to mosquitoes in the behavioral assay (either the two-choice assay or the single stimulus olfactometer assay), such that experimenters were blinded to the Subject ID. Each piece of nylon was attached to a flexible plastic rectangle of the same size (cut with scissors from plastic file folders: Letter size, Office Depot, Catalog #: 700259), using small binder clips (3/4” size, Office Depot Catalog #: 808857). The color of the plastic rectangle indicated the de-identified label given to that nylon, corresponding to the source of the nylon. For instance, in a given experiment, Subject 33 was designated as Subject “A” by someone other than the experimenter, and then the experimenter cut the de-identified nylon pieces and attached all Subject “A” nylons to red plastic cards. The color of the card was chosen randomly for each experiment, and colors rotated between subjects. Each nylon piece was used for only one trial and then discarded. Binder clips and plastic cards were washed with soap and water as described above and set out to air dry at the end of each experiment.
Statistical analyses were performed using R. Two-choice assay data were analyzed by comparing the percent of mosquitoes attracted to each of two stimuli, for several pairs of stimuli, using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests with Bonferroni correction ( Figures 1 B–1E, 2 G–2J, and 4 C–4E). Nonparametric effect size (ES) was calculated as ES= Z/sqrt(N) where N is the number of observations ( Figure 1 E; Fritz et al., 2012 25. Fritz, C.O. ∙ Morris, P.E. ∙ Richler, J.J. Effect size estimates: current use, calculations, and interpretation J. Exp. Psychol. Gen. 2012; 141 :2-18 Crossref Scopus (3260) PubMed Google Scholar ). A power analysis was used to pre-determine the approximate sample size needed for Figure 1 E (G ∗ Power software). Wilcoxon rank-sum tests with Bonferroni correction were used to compare the percent of mosquitoes in each of three categories (attracted, activated but not attracted, or not activated) between wild type and each mutant genotype in Figures 2 B, 2C, and 4 A. Single stimulus olfactometer assay data in Figures 3 D–3G were analyzed by using a Kruskal-Wallis test to compare the percentage of mosquitoes activated or attracted across 4 genotypes: including wild-type controls, 2 heterozygous mutants, and the heteroallelic null mutants. When indicated, post hoc analysis used pairwise Wilcoxon rank-sum tests with Bonferroni correction to compare wild-type mosquitoes to each of the other 3 genotypes for a given stimulus ( Figures 3 D–3G).
The attraction score reported in Figure 1 F was calculated as follows. For each of the 28 subject pairs in the “round-robin tournament”, we calculated the total number of mosquitoes attracted to each subject in the pair, by adding the number that were attracted across every trial performed for that specific pair in Figure 1 E. For example, for the Subject 33 vs Subject 28 pair, we summed the total number of mosquitoes attracted to Subject 33 or to Subject 28 across the 18 trials in which they were compared to each other: Subject 33 attracted 468 mosquitoes, whereas Subject 28 attracted only 35 mosquitoes. We took the difference between these values (468-35=433) and divided it by 18 trials to get the average “margin of victory” per trial for this subject pair (433/18=24). Since Subject 33 attracted 24 more mosquitoes than Subject 28 per trial, on average, Subject 33 was “awarded” 24 points, and Subject 28 was awarded 0 points. Subject 33 also attracted more mosquitoes than the remaining 6 other subjects, with average “margin of victory scores” of 15, 18, 20, 21, 23, and 23. The “attraction score” for each subject, reported in Figure 1 F, represents the sum of 7 average “margin of victory” values. In the example above, the “attraction score” is calculated by summing the average “margin of victory scores” for Subject 33, compared to the 7 other subjects: 15+18+20+21+23+23+24=144.
Nylon sleeves that had been stored at -20°C for 1-10 days were thawed and cut into 5.08 cm x 2.54 cm pieces. Experimenters always handled nylon sleeves with gloves and cleaned scissors with 70% ethanol between samples. For each subject, 6 separate pieces (5.08 cm x 2.54 cm each) of the same nylon sleeve were analyzed in each of the 4 experiments shown in Figure 5 (Experiments 1.1-1.4), and 5 pieces of the same nylon sleeve were analyzed in each of the 4 experiments shown in Figure 6 (Experiments 2.1-2.4). Extraction solvent was 80% methanol (CID: 67-56-1, Methanol, Fisher Chemical, Catalog #:A456-4) prepared with Millipore water and spiked with deuterated isotope-labeled internal standards sourced from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories: nonanoic acid-D17 (CID: 130348-94-6, Catalog #: DLM-9501-0.5), propanoic acid-D5 (CID: 60153-92-6, Catalog #: DLM-1919-5), phenol-D5 (CID:4165-62-2, Catalog #:DLM-695-1), acetate-D4 (CID:1186-52-3, Catalog #: DLM-12-10 ), butyrate-D7 (CID: 73607-83-7, Catalog #: DLM-1508-5) and valerate-D9 (CID: 115871-50-6, Catalog #:DLM-572-1). Each piece of nylon was extracted in 1 mL of extraction solvent in a 5 mL Eppendorf tube (Fisher Scientific Catalog #: 14-282-301). 5 mL Eppendorf tubes containing extraction solvent and nylon were kept overnight at -20°C. Then, each tube was vortexed for 20 seconds to ensure thorough extraction of the nylon. A P1000 pipet with standard 1000 μL pipet tip was used to press the nylon against the side of the 5 mL Eppendorf tube, so that the extraction solvent was squeezed out of the nylon. Before doing this, the plunger of the pipet had been pressed down, so that it could be released after squeezing the nylon, to pick up the extraction solvent, before it could be reabsorbed into the nylon sleeve. Typically, 700-900 μL of nylon “extract” (a cloudy mixture of extraction solvent plus nylon compounds) was recovered from each sample, and this was immediately transferred to a 2 mL glass GC vial (Wheaton μL MicroLiter autosampler vials; 12x32mm, Catalog #: 11-1200) and secured with a septum cap.
100 μL of the liquid nylon extract was manually transferred using a pipet to a new glass autosampler vial, containing 100 μL of borate buffer (100 mM boric acid CID: 10043-35-3, Sigma Aldrich, Catalog #: 339067, adjusted to pH 10 using 10 M NaOH (CID: 1310-73-2, Fisher Chemical, Catalog #: S318500. Subsequent steps were performed using a single needle liquid handling system (Gerstel MPS). First 400 μL of 100 mM pentafluorobenzyl bromide (PFB-Br, CID: 1765-40-8, Sigma-Aldrich, Catalog number: 101052), prepared in acetonitrile (Fisher Chemical; Catalog #: A955-4) and 400 μL cyclohexane (Sigma-Aldrich, Catalog #: 650455-4L) were added sequentially to the reaction vials. Samples were then sealed using crimp caps (Wheaton MicroLiter Catalog #: 11-0040A) and heated to 65°C with shaking for 1 hour to esterify carboxyl and hydroxyl groups ( Figure S2 A). Samples were allowed to cool to room temperature and centrifuged for 2 minutes at 2,500 g, 20°C to promote phase separation, then returned to the robotic sample preparation instrument. Finally, the upper cyclohexane layer was transferred to clean autosampler vials (Wheaton MicroLiter, Catalog #: 11-1200) and 50 μL further transferred into a second clean autosampler vial pre-filled with 450 μL cyclohexane, creating a 10-fold dilution of the derivatized nylon extracts that was subsequently used for GC/QTOF-MS analysis.
GC/QTOF-MS data was collected using an Agilent 7890B gas chromatograph (GC) and an Agilent 7200 quadrupole time-of-flight (QTOF) mass spectrometer (MS), fitted with a Gerstel MPS Robotic Autosampler. 1 μL of the sample volume was injected in splitless mode onto a DB5ms column (30 m × 250 μm, 0.25 μm film thickness; Agilent Technologies, Catalog #:19091S-433). GC conditions were as follows: initial oven temperature 60°C (hold 1 minute), ramp at 25°C/minute to 300°C (hold 2.5 minutes), ramp at 120°C/minute to 60°C (hold 1 minute); the total run time was 16.1 minutes. The inlet, transfer line, chemical ionization (CI) source, and quadrupole temperatures were set to 280°C, 300°C, 150°C, and 150°C respectively. The emission current was set to 4.2 μA and data collection was in 2 GHz mode, mass range m /z 50-650. For all GC/QTOF-MS experiments, the sample injection order was randomized using the “RAND” function in Microsoft Excel. The same GC column was used for data acquisition shown in Figures 5 and 6 , column trimming as part of routine maintenance was responsible for slightly shorter retention times shown in Figure 6 . The Q-TOF mass spectrometer was operated in negative chemical ionization (nCI) mode with methane as the reagent gas (1 mL/minute); in nCI mode, derivatized molecules undergo electron capture dissociation (ECD), resulting in the loss of the PFB derivatization group.
The workflow for GC/QTOF-MS data analysis is summarized in Table S1 . Raw data (Agilent “.D” files) were analyzed using Agilent MassHunter software. Untargeted feature finding was performed using Agilent Unknowns Analysis software (v10.1) ( Table S1 , step 1). Specifically, data were first converted using SureMass peak detection (absolute height filter >1000 counts, RT window size factor=50, Extraction window +-50ppm, use base peak shape=yes, sharpness threshold 25%, Ion peaks minimum=1, maximum=1). Subsequently, feature finding was performed on all worn nylon samples across 4 replicate experiments for Experiments 1.1-1.4 ( Figure 5 ) and, again for Experiments 2.1-2.4 ( Figure 6 ). Putative features, denoted as accurate mass @ retention time, were exported from Unknowns Analysis as a.csv file, and imported into R. A custom deduplication script was used to remove most “fuzzy” duplicate features with similar mass and retention time values, and features detected in <10 data files, resulting in a list of 1494 features for the experiments in Figure 5 , and 1925 features for the experiments in Figure 6 ( Table S1 , step 2). This feature list was imported into Agilent Quantitative Analysis software (v10.1) and a targeted data re-extraction performed (settings: +Gaussian smoothing, +area filter ≥ 0, RT window: ± 0.05 minutes extraction window ± 100 ppm) ( Table S1 , step 3), resulting in a fully aligned dataset across 4 replicate experiments. Raw peak areas were then exported as a.csv file, and a custom R script was again used to remove features present in <10% of samples, impute missing values with 1/2 the lowest value for that feature, and log 2 transform data ( Table S1 , step 4). The resulting.csv file was imported into Agilent Mass Profiler Professional software (v15.1). We considered high quality features to be those found in at least 50% of samples in at least 1 subject group, with a coefficient of variation <40% in at least 1 subject group. Putative human skin-derived features were considered those at least 2-fold enriched (false discovery rate, FDR<0.05) in any Subject’s worn nylons versus unworn nylons and solvent blank controls ( Table S1 , step 5). Volcano plots were used to filter on features differentially abundant in the high versus low attractor subjects in each individual experiment of 4 replicate experiments ( Table S1 , step 6; Figures 5 D and 6 D). Venn diagrams were used to identify hits that met the differential abundance criteria in high versus low attractors across all 4 replicate experiments ( Table S1 , step 7): Experiments 1.1-1.4 ( Figure 5 E) and Experiments 2.1-2.4 ( Figure 6 E). Redundant features with closely matching mass and retention times, that were missed by the earlier deduplication step were removed manually, after inspecting the raw data in Agilent Qualitative Analysis software ( Table S1 , step 8). Lists of mass and retention times for unknown features that were found in 4 replicate experiments, either Experiments 1.1-1.4 or Experiments 2.1-2.4 are available on Zenodo ( https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5822538 ). For all targeted data re-extractions, 100 ppm mass accuracy was used to extract the detected pseudomolecular [M-H] - ion, unless the peak was considered saturated, in which case the [(M+1)-H] - isotope was used consistently across all data files. For Experiments 1.1-1.4, we calculated the median abundance of each compound in each of 4 experiments for each of 2 high attractor subjects and 2 low attractor subjects ( Figure S2 C). Then we compared these values for each compound between the high and low attractor groups using a nonparametric linear mixed effects model for repeated measures based on ranks, with group as a fixed effect and subject as a random effect. Benjamini-Hochberg correction was applied for multiple comparisons (FDR<0.1). For Experiments 2.1-2.4, we calculated the median abundance value for each compound in each subject across 4 replicate experiments, and then we compared these values between the high (n=11) vs low attractor (n=7) groups ( Figure 6 H) using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Benjamini-Hochberg correction was applied for multiple comparisons (FDR<0.1). Statistical analysis was performed in R version 4.0.4. Heatmaps were generated using Metaboanalyst (v5.0; https://www.metaboanalyst.ca/ ) ( Pang et al., 2021 60. Pang, Z. ∙ Chong, J. ∙ Zhou, G. ... MetaboAnalyst 5.0: narrowing the gap between raw spectra and functional insights Nucleic Acids Res. 2021; 49 :W388-W396 Crossref Scopus (2282) PubMed Google Scholar ) using autoscaled data.
To identify compounds of interest, we used the accurate mass of the molecular ion (M-H) to predict chemical formulas using Agilent Qualitative Analysis software (v10.0). Formula prediction was constrained to C, H, O, N atoms, and formulas within 100 ppm mass error of the measured mass were considered ( Table S1 , step 9). Predicted formulas for unknown compounds are included in Data File S1. To achieve positive identification, we spiked nylon samples with authentic standards (details below) and asked whether the area of the unknown peak increased symmetrically ( Table S1 , step 10). Overlaid extracted ion chromatograms generated in Agilent Qualitative Analysis software for three hit compounds are shown in Figure S3 C. Commercially standards used were: propanoic acid (CID: 5818-15-5, Millipore Sigma; Catalog #: 94425-1ML-F), butyric acid(CID: 107-92-6; Millipore Sigma; Catalog #: 19215-5ML), pentanoic acid (CID: 109-52-4; Millipore Sigma; Catalog #: 75054-1ML), hexanoic acid(CID: 142-62-1; Millipore Sigma; 21529-5ML), heptanoic acid (CID: 111-14-8; Millipore Sigma; Catalog #: 43858), octanoic acid (CID: 124-07-2; Millipore Sigma; Catalog #:21639), nonanoic acid (CID: 112-05-0; Millipore Sigma; Catalog #:73982), decanoic acid (CID: 334-48-5; Millipore Sigma; Catalog #:21409), undecanoic acid (112-37-8; Millipore Sigma; Catalog #:89764), dodecanoic acid (143-07-7; Millipore Sigma; Catalog #:61609), tridecanoic acid (CID: 638-53-9; Millipore Sigma; Catalog #: 91988), tetradecanoic acid (CID: 62217-71-4; Millipore Sigma; Catalog #:70079), pentadecanoic acid (CID: 1002-84-2; Millipore Sigma; Catalog #:91446), hexadecanoic acid (CID: 57-10-3; Millipore Sigma; Catalog #:76119), heptadecanoic acid (CID: 506-12-7; Millipore Sigma; Catalog #:H3500), octadecanoic acid (CID: 38003-60-0; Millipore Sigma; Catalog #:85679), nonadecanoic acid (CID: 646-30-0; Millipore Sigma; Catalog #:72332), icosanoic acid (CID: 506-30-9); Millipore Sigma; Catalog #: 39383).
All statistical analyses were performed using R version 4.0.4 ( R Development Core Team, 2021 81.
