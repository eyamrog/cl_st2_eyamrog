Title: Regulation of Collective Metastasis by Nanolumenal Signaling


Abstract: Summary

Collective metastasis is defined as the cohesive migration and metastasis of multicellular tumor cell clusters. Disrupting various cell adhesion genes markedly reduces cluster formation and colonization efficiency, yet the downstream signals transmitted by clustering remain largely unknown. Here, we use mouse and human breast cancer models to identify a collective signal generated by tumor cell clusters supporting metastatic colonization. We show that tumor cell clusters produce the growth factor epigen and concentrate it within nanolumina—intercellular compartments sealed by cell-cell junctions and lined with microvilli-like protrusions. Epigen knockdown profoundly reduces metastatic outgrowth and switches clusters from a proliferative to a collective migratory state. Tumor cell clusters from basal-like 2, but not mesenchymal-like, triple-negative breast cancer cell lines have increased epigen expression, sealed nanolumina, and impaired outgrowth upon nanolumenal junction disruption. We propose that nanolumenal signaling could offer a therapeutic target for aggressive metastatic breast cancers.

Section: Introduction

Although metastasis is often conceived of as a single cell process, multicellular tumor cell clusters have been directly observed at tumor invasive fronts, within the systemic circulation, and colonizing distant organs ( Aceto et al., 2015 2.

In different mouse models, multicellular clusters give rise to between 50%–97% of metastases, supporting a collective origin of metastasis ( Aceto et al., 2014 1.

Although disrupting cell adhesion genes reduced cluster formation and metastatic potential in multiple studies, how cluster formation induces these molecular changes is less clear.

Thus, clustering of tumor cells could give rise to complex signaling mechanisms distinct from those utilized by single cells.
In the present study, we used mouse and human models of breast cancer metastasis to identify collective signals generated by tumor cell clusters during metastatic outgrowth. We show that mouse and human tumor cell clusters harbor nanolumina—intercellular signaling compartments sealed by cell-cell junctions. Within nanolumina, we identify a diffusible growth factor, epigen, which controls switching between collective migratory and proliferative modes. Importantly, we find that epigen expression and nanolumen formation are enriched in a subtype of aggressive, triple-negative human breast cancers.

Section: Results

To temporally control cluster formation and monitor downstream molecular events ( Figure 1 A), we used an aggressive mouse model of breast cancer, MMTV-PyMT, ( Guy et al., 1992 30.

Collective invasion in breast cancer requires a conserved basal epithelial program Cell. 2013; 155 :1639-1651 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (608) PubMed Google Scholar , 2016 12.

USA. 2016; 113 :E854-E863 Crossref Scopus (533) PubMed Google Scholar ). When MMTV-PyMT tumor organoids were enzymatically dissociated and cultured in suspension, single tumor cells spontaneously assembled into loosely attached aggregates by 6 h and more compact clusters by 24 h ( Figure S1 A; Video S1 ). MMTV-PyMT membrane-Tomato-labeled tumor organoids were dissociated to single cells and then four input suspensions were generated: single cells aggregated for 0 h, for 6 h, for 24 h, and for 24 h then re-dissociated back to single cells. Equal cell numbers of each suspension were injected into immunocompromised NSG mice. 3 weeks later, loosely attached (6 h) clusters formed 141-fold and compact (24 h) clusters formed 532-fold more lung metastases than an equal number of single cells ( Figures 1 B and S1 B). Well-organized (24 h) clusters re-dissociated back into single cells were negligibly metastatic ( Figure 1 B), indicating that metastatic potential in this system requires multicellular organization.

Single Tumor Cells Assembling into Clusters in Suspension, Related to Figure 1 DIC time-lapse of MMTV-PyMT single cells self-assembling into clusters in low-basement membrane suspension culture.
Both single cells and clusters were trapped in the lungs of mice shortly after tail vein injection ( Figure S1 C), but clusters persisted while single cells were largely cleared by 3 weeks post-injection ( Figures S1 D and S1E). Likewise, intracardiac injection of clustered tumor cells generated significantly more metastases to multiple organs than injection of single cells ( Figures S1 F and S1G), indicating superior metastatic potential of clusters delivered by both venous and arterial routes.
Concordant with these in vivo observations, MMTV-PyMT tumor cell clusters had >4.7-fold higher outgrowth than single cells in 3D basement membrane-rich gels ( Figure S2 A). Proliferation was highest in clusters with tumor cells directly contacting multiple neighbors ( Figures S2 B and S2C). In addition, we used a caspase-3/7 fluorescent biosensor to measure apoptosis. MMTV-PyMT clusters had >2.2-fold higher survival than single cells ( Figure S2 D). Further, 8 of 10 individual human breast cancer tumor specimens, including those from metastases to brain and bone, had 2.5- to >70-fold higher survival as clusters ( Figures S2 E and S2F; Table S1 ). Together, these data establish a system to dissect the metastasis-promoting signals downstream of tumor cell cluster formation.
We next performed an RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) time course of MMTV-PyMT cells throughout their aggregation from single cells to highly metastatic clusters (from 0 to 48 h after dissociation) ( Figures 1 A and 1C). This revealed sequential upregulation of different biological pathways: at 0 h, HIF1 and interferon stress signaling pathways; at 6 h, wound-healing and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-associated genes; at 12 h, ribosome biogenesis; and at 24 and 48 h, genes involved in cell cycle and fatty acid metabolism ( Figure 1 C; Table S2 ). Analysis of early clusters (6 h) compared to single cells revealed that clustering rapidly induced expression of low-affinity EGFR ligands epigen and amphiregulin ( Figure 1 D). Epgn was the most differentially expressed of all mRNAs ( Table S3 ). Compared to high-affinity ligands like EGF, low-affinity EGFR ligands are associated with prolonged signaling and altered effector responses ( Freed et al., 2017 21. Freed, D.M. ∙ Bessman, N.J. ∙ Kiyatkin, A. ... EGFR Ligands Differentially Stabilize Receptor Dimers to Specify Signaling Kinetics Cell. 2017; 171 :683-695 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (236) PubMed Google Scholar ). uPar ( Plaur ), which can participate in ligand-independent EGFR activation ( Liu et al., 2002 44. Liu, D. ∙ Aguirre Ghiso, J. ∙ Estrada, Y. ...

Smith, H.W. ∙ Marshall, C.J. Regulation of cell signalling by uPAR Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11 :23-36 Crossref Scopus (768) PubMed Google Scholar ), was also highly induced in clusters. Therefore, we hypothesized that growth factor production and EGFR activation could support the superior metastatic colonization of clusters.
To test the role of EGFR-associated genes in collective metastatic outgrowth, we used lentiviral RNAi to deplete Egfr , Epgn , Areg , and Plaur in MMTV-PyMT tumor cell clusters ( Figure S3 A). Importantly, knockdowns suppressed outgrowth in 3D culture but did not disrupt the ability of tumor cells to aggregate, supporting the hypothesis that these factors act downstream of clustering ( Figures S3 B and S3C). Next, for each condition, equal numbers of clustered cells were injected by tail vein. 3 weeks later, we observed significant reductions in metastatic burden relative to control by Egfr-kd, Areg-kd, and Epgn-kd ( Figures 1 E and 1F). Strikingly, Epgn-kd reduced metastatic outgrowth in the lungs by >94% and strongly reduced the size, but not total number, of lung metastases ( Figures S1 H and S1I). Further, lung metastases had reduced reporter GFP expression in Epgn-kd but not non-targeting Ctrl-kd cluster injected mice, indicating selective pressure to escape epigen knockdown ( Figures S1 J and S1K). Taken together, these data indicate that efficient metastatic outgrowth depends on epigen expression.
We next sought to determine the biological processes regulated by epigen expression. RNA-seq of Ctrl-kd and Epgn-kd MMTV-PyMT clusters revealed that Epgn-kd clusters downregulate cell cycle genes, upregulate migration-related genes ( Figure 2 A; Table S4 ), and their transcription most closely resembles nascent, non-proliferative clusters ( Figure 1 C and Figure 2 B). Gene set analysis revealed that Epgn-kd induces expression of genes in cadherin, desmosome, tight junction, and matrix metalloproteinase families ( Figure 2 C). Although Epgn-kd induced expression of some epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated genes, Epgn-kd organoids showed persistent expression of epithelial genes including Epcam and Cdh1 ( Figure 2 C), and expression of multiple cytokeratins including Krt5 , Krt14 , and Krt17 ( Figures S3 E and S3F) associated with basal/myoepithelial and invasive leader cells ( Cheung et al., 2013 11. Cheung, K.J. ∙ Gabrielson, E. ∙ Werb, Z. ...

USA. 2016; 113 :E854-E863 Crossref Scopus (533) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To functionally test the effects of epigen suppression on collective outgrowth and migration, Ctrl-kd and Epgn-kd clusters were embedded in 3D basement membrane-rich gels and monitored by time-lapse microscopy ( Figure 2 D; Video S2 ). Compared with Ctrl-kd clusters, Epgn-kd clusters showed markedly increased migration but reduced outgrowth and proliferation ( Figures 2 E–2G and S3 D). Consistent with retained mRNA expression of epithelial genes, Epgn-kd clusters migrated not as individual cells but as E-cad + /K14 + /K17 + clusters ( Figures 2 H and S3 F). We further confirmed that a second epigen short hairpin RNA (shRNA) reduced epigen expression and outgrowth ( Figures S3 G and S3H), and that outgrowth was rescued by an shRNA-resistant human epigen construct ( Figure S3 I). Taken together, these data reveal that epigen expression supports the transition of clustered tumor cells from a collective migratory to proliferative state.

Migration and Outgrowth of Ctrl-kd and Epgn-kd Clusters in 3D Basement Membrane-Rich Gels, Related to Figure 2 DIC time-lapse of Epgn-kd and Ctrl-kd MMTV-PyMT tumor cell clusters cultured in 3D basement membrane-rich gels for 120 hr. (Bottom) migration tracks of all Ctrl-kd and Epgn-kd clusters, with the examples from this movie highlighted in red and blue lines, respectively.
We reasoned that epigen could be secreted from clusters into their local microenvironment, facilitating long-range paracrine signaling (model 1, Figure 3 A). If this was the case, then co-culture with non-transduced clusters should partly rescue the outgrowth defect of nearby Epgn-kd clusters. However, time-lapse imaging indicated that Epgn-kd clusters co-cultured with non-transduced clusters had similar outgrowth as those cultured in 3D gels alone ( Figures 3 B and 3C). In addition, immunofluorescence revealed that epigen was largely restricted to intercellular areas in clusters from MMTV-PyMT, MMTV-Neu, and C3(1)-TAg mouse models of breast cancer which was depleted upon epigen knockdown ( Figures 3 D, 3E, and S4 A–S4C). Likewise, mTomato-PyMT clusters transduced with an epigen-mGFP fusion construct had enriched GFP signal at intercellular regions ( Figure 3 F). These data indicate that epigen acts primarily as a short-range outgrowth signal.
We next sought to test whether epigen acts non-cell-autonomously or in a cell autonomous manner (model 2). If epigen ligand is shared non-cell-autonomously among neighboring cells, adding epigen-expressing cells to a cluster should rescue the outgrowth of adjacent epigen deficient cells. Epgn-kd cells were mixed with non-transduced cells to form mosaic clusters ( Figure 3 G). After 6 days, clusters were dissociated and the number of Epgn-kd cells was counted to assess their outgrowth. Mixing non-transduced cells and Epgn-kd cells in a 9:1 ratio increased the outgrowth of Epgn-kd cells 3-fold higher than when cultured alone ( Figure 3 H). Further, Epgn-kd cells aggregated with Ctrl-kd cells migrated markedly less than pure Epgn-kd clusters ( Figure S4 E).
These data suggest that epigen induces outgrowth of neighboring cells non-cell-autonomously. Consistent with this hypothesis, recombinant epigen induced outgrowth in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure S4 D). However, an alternative explanation is that epigen does not directly promote outgrowth but rather induces expression of a second growth signal transmitted to neighboring cells (model 3). To test this, we performed mosaic mixing experiments with non-transduced cells and Egfr-kd cells. Egfr-kd cells in mosaic clusters did not grow significantly more than when cultured as pure Egfr-kd clusters ( Figure 3 H), demonstrating that non-transduced cells do not produce a second signal downstream of EGFR that can rescue Egfr-kd outgrowth. Thus, epigen’s intercellular enrichment, short-range restriction, and non-cell-autonomous activity all indicate that epigen acts within clusters as a shared, collective growth signal (model 4).
We next used transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to characterize the physical properties of the site of epigen accumulation in MMTV-PyMT clusters. To our surprise, we observed that intercellular membranes, rather than being closely apposed, were often separated by hollow cavities bounded by electron-dense cell-cell junctions and lined by microvilli-like protrusions ( Figures 4 A and S4 F). We refer to these intercellular cavities as “nanolumina.” Importantly, epigen knockdown did not alter nanolumina morphology, indicating that epigen expression is not required for nanolumina formation ( Figure S4 G).
We hypothesized that the nanolumina observed in tumor cell clusters could concentrate soluble signaling molecules such as epigen ( Figure 4 B), not unlike the luminal signaling compartments observed in collectively migrating zebrafish lateral line primordium ( Durdu et al., 2014 17. Durdu, S. ∙ Iskar, M. ∙ Revenu, C. ... Luminal signalling links cell communication to tissue architecture during organogenesis Nature. 2014; 515 :120-124 Crossref Scopus (118) PubMed Google Scholar ). Alternatively, epigen could localize to areas of direct cell-cell contact and activate EGFR in a membrane-restricted juxtracrine manner. Consistent with the first model, stimulated emission depletion microscopy revealed concentration of epigen within intercellular spaces ( Figure 4 C). Immunoelectron microscopy also confirmed the presence of epigen within nanolumenal cavities and along nanolumenal membranes but not at direct cell-cell junctions ( Figures 4 D and 4E). Epigen was not restricted to areas expressing the apical marker Muc1, suggesting that these are not apically polarized lumina ( Figure S4 H). Together, these findings suggest that epigen diffuses within shared nanolumina.
The accumulation of epigen within nanolumina implied a mechanism for preventing ligand diffusion out of clusters. To characterize junctional permeability, we treated clusters with sulfo-NHS-biotin which labels membrane surface proteins but is excluded from the cytosol. At baseline, biotin was excluded from areas of cell-cell contact, predominantly labeling areas of cell-matrix contact ( Figure 4 F). Disruption of junctions by calcium chelation, Latrunculin A, or ochratoxin A allowed biotin to leak between clustered cells ( Figures 4 F and S4 I). Likewise, calcium chelation reduced epigen immunofluorescence in clusters ( Figure 4 G). Although we could not measure the nanolumenal concentration of epigen directly, we estimated it to be >5,000-fold higher than the extra-cluster concentration (223 versus 0.04 ng/mL, Figure S4 J). Thus, restricted junctional permeability facilitates a high local concentration of epigen between clustered cells.
To assess the dominant receptor tyrosine kinase pathway active in clusters in an unbiased manner, we performed protein array analysis of 39 phospho-RTKs in single-cell versus cluster lysates. ERBB family members pTyr-EGFR and pTyr-HER2, which can heterodimerize with EGFR, were the most cluster-upregulated phospho-RTKs ( Figure S5 A). We observed induction of EGFR effectors pERK1/2 and pAKT in clustered tumor cells ( Figures S5 B–S5D). In addition, pEGFR and HER2 localized to intercellular areas between clustered tumor cells ( Figures S5 E and S5F). Using immunoelectron microscopy, we confirmed that pEGFR and HER2 localized primarily along nanolumenal membranes as opposed to nanolumenal voids, as would be expected of transmembrane receptors ( Figures S5 G and S5H). These data show that nanolumina form a productive compartment for epigen-EGFR signaling.
Having identified the site and mechanism of epigen signaling ex vivo , we next assessed epigen expression and nanolumina formation during metastasis. MMTV-PyMT mTomato + clusters were transplanted into mammary fat pads of NSG mice. Intercellular epigen was highly expressed in primary tumors and frequently in locally disseminated tumor cell clusters ( Figures 5 A and 5B). Likewise, distant metastases consistently expressed intercellular epigen ( Figures 5 D–5F and S6 D), pEGFR, and HER2 ( Figures S6 E and S6F). In contrast, epigen was absent or weakly expressed in locally disseminated single cells ( Figure 5 B) and in surrounding normal tissues ( Figures 5 A–5F, S6 B, and S6D). In addition, locally disseminated tumor cell clusters adopted two morphologies: strand-like/protrusive and nest-like/non-protrusive. In primary tumors, protrusive clusters had lower epigen expression than their non-protrusive counterparts ( Figure 5 C) although they retained cytokeratin expression ( Figure S6 C). Likewise, protrusive clusters adjacent to brain metastases expressed epigen at lower levels than their non-protrusive counterparts ( Figure 5 F). These findings reveal that epigen expression is lowest in locally disseminated single cells and protrusive clusters and highest in non-protrusive clusters and in primary and metastatic tumors.
TEM of MMTV-PyMT primary tumors revealed extensive intercellular nanolumina similar to those observed ex-vivo ( Figure 5 G). When tumors were exposed to sulfo-NHS-biotin prior to fixation, biotin was found extensively in the tumor-adjacent stroma but was largely excluded from tumor cell nests ( Figure 5 H). We observed increased biotin permeability in protrusive compared with non-protrusive clusters ( Figure 5 I). Like primary tumors, lung metastases were largely biotin impermeable ( Figure 5 J). Thus, restricted nanolumenal permeability and epigen accumulation occur at phases of metastasis associated with outgrowth.
To assess the functional role of epigen in vivo , Ctrl-kd and Epgn-kd clusters were orthotopically transplanted into the mammary fat pads of NSG mice. We observed significantly slower growth of Epgn-kd tumors versus control tumors ( Figure 5 K) and a modest increase in locally disseminated clusters in the adjacent stroma ( Figure S6 G). Importantly, Epgn-kd lung metastases were significantly less proliferative ( Figure S6 H) and smaller ( Figure S6 I) than Ctrl-kd metastases. Although Epgn-kd mice harbored fewer macrometastases ( Figure 7 L), the total number of metastases, including micrometastases, was similar between Ctrl-kd and Epgn-kd mouse lungs ( Figure S6 J), supporting a larger effect on metastatic outgrowth than initial seeding. Epgn-kd tumors lost expression of the shRNA-GFP construct more frequently than Ctrl-kd tumors ( Figure S6 K), indicating selective pressure to revert to Epgn-high phenotypes. Thus, epigen suppression reduces primary tumor and metastatic outgrowth, while increasing local dissemination of clusters, consistent with our ex vivo findings.
We next sought to determine the generality of our findings to human breast cancer. Tumor cell clusters were collected from a breast cancer patient recruited to an institutional review board (IRB)-approved study at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. At the time of enrollment, the patient had ER + /PR + /HER2 − breast cancer that was metastatic to orbit, lung, liver, and bone. CTC clusters were detected at the second and third time points, coinciding with clinical evidence of disease progression ( Figures 6 A and 6B). Palliative paracentesis revealed malignant ascites containing cytokeratin-positive/CD45-negative tumor cell clusters ( Figure 6 C), phosphorylated EGFR at intercellular contacts ( Figure 6 C), and enriched epigen expression relative to adjacent CD45 + cells ( Figure S7 B). Further, TEM revealed nanolumina with microvilli-like protrusions in ascites-derived tumor cell clusters ( Figure 6 D). Malignant ascites were also collected from a second patient with metastatic ER + /PR + /HER2 − breast cancer. At the time of paracentesis, she was treated with letrozole and abemaciclib and had metastatic disease to bone, liver, chest wall, stomach, and peritoneum. Similarly, tumor cell clusters collected from this patient demonstrated intercellular pEGFR and epigen expression as well as intercellular nanolumina ( Figures S7 A and S7B). These clinical observations support the disease relevance of nanolumenal signaling for in vivo metastasis.
As a second approach, we examined epigen expression in two RNA-seq compendia of human breast cancer cell lines ( Barretina et al., 2012 5. Barretina, J. ∙ Caponigro, G. ∙ Stransky, N. ... The Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia enables predictive modelling of anticancer drug sensitivity Nature. 2012; 483 :603-607 Crossref Scopus (5622) PubMed Google Scholar ; Klijn et al., 2015 35. Klijn, C. ∙ Durinck, S. ∙ Stawiski, E.W. ... A comprehensive transcriptional portrait of human cancer cell lines Nat. Biotechnol. 2015; 33 :306-312 Crossref Scopus (467) PubMed Google Scholar ). Triple-negative cell lines have been previously classified based on their gene expression into subgroups: basal-like 1 (BL1), basal-like 2 (BL2), mesenchymal-like (M-like), and luminal androgen receptor (LAR) ( Lehmann et al., 2011 41. Lehmann, B.D. ∙ Bauer, J.A. ∙ Chen, X. ... Identification of human triple-negative breast cancer subtypes and preclinical models for selection of targeted therapies J. Clin. Invest. 2011; 121 :2750-2767 Crossref Scopus (3972) PubMed Google Scholar , 2016 42. Lehmann, B.D. ∙ Jovanović, B. ∙ Chen, X. ... Refinement of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Molecular Subtypes: Implications for Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Selection PLoS ONE. 2016; 11 :e0157368 Crossref Scopus (889) PubMed Google Scholar ). We observed a strong association between EPGN expression and the basal-like 2 subgroup, whereas mesenchymal-like breast cancer cell lines had the lowest EPGN expression ( Figures 6 E and S7 C). BL2 triple-negative breast cancers have increased growth factor signaling, basal/myoepithelial gene expression, and poor response rates to chemotherapy ( Masuda et al., 2013 53. Masuda, H. ∙ Baggerly, K.A. ∙ Wang, Y. ... Differential response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy among 7 triple-negative breast cancer molecular subtypes Clin. Cancer Res. 2013; 19 :5533-5540 Crossref Scopus (572) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ring et al., 2016 64. Ring, B.Z. ∙ Hout, D.R. ∙ Morris, S.W. ... Generation of an algorithm based on minimal gene sets to clinically subtype triple negative breast cancer patients BMC Cancer. 2016; 16 :143 Crossref Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ).
TEM revealed considerable morphological differences between three BL2, epigen-high cell lines (HCC70, CAL851, and HDQP1) and three M-like, epigen-low cell lines (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-436, and BT549). BL2 cell clusters contained nanolumina with extensive microvilli-like protrusions, often sealed by electron-dense junctional complexes ( Figure 6 F). In contrast, M-like cell clusters were loosely organized and largely lacked junctionally sealed intercellular spaces. Further, BL2 cell clusters were highly biotin-impermeable, whereas biotin readily leaked into the intercellular spaces of M-like clusters ( Figure 6 G). Importantly, transcriptional analysis of these 6 cell lines revealed that BL2/epigen-high line gene expression was enriched for genes related to epithelial development and migration, branching morphogenesis of the placental labyrinthine layer ( Rinkenberger and Werb, 2000 65. Rinkenberger, J. ∙ Werb, Z. The labyrinthine placenta Nat. Genet. 2000; 25 :248-250 Crossref Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ), and tight junctions ( Figures 6 H and 6I; Table S5 ). M-like cell lines, on the other hand, were enriched for genes related to collagen metabolism and FGFR signaling relative to BL2 lines ( Figure S7 D; Table S5 ). These data show that epigen enrichment and nanolumina occur in aggressive metastatic breast cancers and reveal large differences in nanolumina formation, junctional permeability, and morphogenesis-related gene expression between BL2 and M-like cells.
HCC70 was the highest EPGN expressing cell line in both RNA-seq datasets ( Barretina et al., 2012 5. Barretina, J. ∙ Caponigro, G. ∙ Stransky, N. ... The Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia enables predictive modelling of anticancer drug sensitivity Nature. 2012; 483 :603-607 Crossref Scopus (5622) PubMed Google Scholar ; Klijn et al., 2015 35. Klijn, C. ∙ Durinck, S. ∙ Stawiski, E.W. ... A comprehensive transcriptional portrait of human cancer cell lines Nat. Biotechnol. 2015; 33 :306-312 Crossref Scopus (467) PubMed Google Scholar ). Notably, when compared to a transcriptomic dataset of metastatic solid tumors (MET500), HCC70 cells modeled the gene expression of basal-like breast cancers more closely than other tested cell lines ( Liu et al., 2019a 45. Liu, K. ∙ Newbury, P.A. ∙ Glicksberg, B.S. ... Evaluating cell lines as models for metastatic breast cancer through integrative analysis of genomic data Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :2138 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ; Robinson et al., 2017 66. Robinson, D.R. ∙ Wu, Y.-M. ∙ Lonigro, R.J. ... Integrative clinical genomics of metastatic cancer Nature. 2017; 548 :297-303 Crossref Scopus (607) PubMed Google Scholar ). We observed that HCC70 clusters expressed epigen, pEGFR, and the tight junction protein occludin, but not HER2 ( Figure 7 A). Importantly, EPGN knockdown in HCC70 clusters significantly reduced their outgrowth ex vivo ( Figures 7 B and 7C). No significant differences in migration or outgrowth were observed in 2D ( Figures S7 E and S7F). Transduction with an EPGN single guide RNA (sgRNA) likewise reduced HCC70 cluster outgrowth ( Figure S7 G). To assess epigen’s role in metastatic outgrowth, Epgn-kd HCC70 cell clusters were injected by tail vein into immunocompromised NSG mice. 3 weeks later, the Epgn-kd clusters had formed significantly smaller metastases than Ctrl-kd clusters ( Figure 7 D). Thus, epigen dependence and nanolumina formation occur in both mouse and human models of breast cancer.
The existence of nanolumina suggested that this structure could be targeted to reduce collective signaling during metastasis. The cytokine IFNγ can enhance paracellular diffusion ( Bruewer et al., 2003 8. Bruewer, M. ∙ Luegering, A. ∙ Kucharzik, T. ... Proinflammatory cytokines disrupt epithelial barrier function by apoptosis-independent mechanisms J. Immunol. 2003; 171 :6164-6172 Crossref Scopus (755) PubMed Google Scholar ; Madara and Stafford, 1989 49. Madara, J.L. ∙ Stafford, J. Interferon-gamma directly affects barrier function of cultured intestinal epithelial monolayers J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83 :724-727 Crossref Scopus (676) PubMed Google Scholar ) and increase epithelial flux to amplify immune responses ( Turner, 2009 75. Turner, J.R. Intestinal mucosal barrier function in health and disease Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 9 :799-809 Crossref Scopus (2752) PubMed Google Scholar ). We hypothesized that IFNγ could weaken the barriers sealing nanolumina and inhibit cluster outgrowth. Consistent with this hypothesis, IFNγ treatment strongly reduced HCC70 tumor cell cluster outgrowth (IC 50 = 0.58 ng/mL) ( Figure 7 E). IFNγ reduced proliferation but did not increase cell death in HCC70 clusters ( Figures 7 F and S7 H). Importantly, IFNγ treatment increased biotin permeability of HCC70 clusters ( Figure 7 G) and altered nanolumenal morphology ( Figure 7 H). Additionally, HCC70 clusters had reduced mRNA expression of tight junction related genes RAB25 and CLDN7 after IFNγ treatment ( Figure 7 I). Conversely, MDA-MB-231 clusters were far less sensitive to IFNγ treatment ( Figure 7 E), lowly expressed RAB25 and CLDN7 ( Figure S7 I), and were highly biotin-permeable with or without IFNγ treatment ( Figure S7 J).
Next, we tested the effects of IFNγ on metastatic outgrowth. After 6 days of IFNγ (2 ng/mL) treatment, equal viable cell numbers of HCC70 clustered cells were injected by tail vein into NSG mice ( Figure 7 J). 3 weeks later, HCC70 metastases in the lungs were identified using a human-specific antibody ( Lawson et al., 2015 40. Lawson, D.A. ∙ Bhakta, N.R. ∙ Kessenbrock, K. ... Single-cell analysis reveals a stem-cell program in human metastatic breast cancer cells Nature. 2015; 526 :131-135 Crossref Scopus (703) PubMed Google Scholar ). IFNγ pre-treated clusters formed significantly smaller and fewer metastases than untreated controls ( Figures 7 K and 7L). Although IFNγ is likely to have pleotropic effects, these data suggest that a nanolumen-opening agent could impair the collective metastatic outgrowth of tumor cell clusters.

Section: Discussion

Metastasis is regulated by factors both internal to the cancer cell as well as arising from interactions with its tumor microenvironment ( Fidler and Kripke, 2015 20. Fidler, I.J. ∙ Kripke, M.L.

Metastatic colonization by circulating tumour cells Nature. 2016; 529 :298-306 Crossref Scopus (1440) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our study reveals an additional dimension: the shared intercellular exchange of growth factors between clustered tumor cells. Here, we find that multicellular clusters form nanolumina—intercellular compartments that accumulate a high local concentration of epigen ( Figure S7 K). In this way, tumor cell clusters construct their own internal microenvironment and collective signals to drive metastatic outgrowth.
Recent studies have demonstrated that tumor cells can cooperatively support polyclonal growth and metastasis through secreted paracrine signals between genetically distinct clones ( Cleary et al., 2014 14. Cleary, A.S. ∙ Leonard, T.L. ∙ Gestl, S.A. ...

Non-cell-autonomous driving of tumour growth supports sub-clonal heterogeneity Nature. 2014; 514 :54-58 Crossref Scopus (463) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, we uncover a different mechanism in which cooperative signaling is generated by the physical architecture of nanolumina. In this regard, our findings share parallels with the concentration of FGF within lumens in migrating lateral line primordia ( Durdu et al., 2014 17. Durdu, S. ∙ Iskar, M. ∙ Revenu, C. ... Luminal signalling links cell communication to tissue architecture during organogenesis Nature. 2014; 515 :120-124 Crossref Scopus (118) PubMed Google Scholar ), but the compartments we observe here are typically nanometer-scale in diameter and do not appear apically polarized. Recent findings have similarly emphasized the impact of 3D topology on signaling during development and in generating synthetic biological systems ( Durdu et al., 2014 17.

Xavier da Silveira Dos Santos, A. ∙ Liberali, P. From single cells to tissue self-organization FEBS J. 2019; 286 :1495-1513 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our study supports the parallel importance of 3D multicellular architecture in shaping signaling during metastasis.
Although single cell metastasis has been conceptualized as a series of switch-like transitions ( Lambert et al., 2017 39. Lambert, A.W. ∙ Pattabiraman, D.R. ∙ Weinberg, R.A. Emerging Biological Principles of Metastasis Cell. 2017; 168 :670-691 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2098) PubMed Google Scholar ; Massagué and Obenauf, 2016 52. Massagué, J. ∙ Obenauf, A.C. Metastatic colonization by circulating tumour cells Nature. 2016; 529 :298-306 Crossref Scopus (1440) PubMed Google Scholar ), the factors regulating transitions during collective metastasis are far less understood. Our findings reveal an epigen signaling axis regulating switching between proliferative and migratory modes. Importantly, loss of epigen does not result in dissolution of clusters to individualized tumor cells. Rather, our findings suggest that the nanolumen compartment and its epigen content are dynamically regulated. In this study, we also observed that locally disseminated clusters that are highly protrusive are more biotin permeable than rounded, non-protrusive clusters. Future studies are indicated to understand the plasticity, regulatory factors, and metastatic potential of clusters with differing permeability. In addition, interrogating nanolumen composition could reveal other signaling molecules regulating transitions during multicellular metastasis ( Grigore et al., 2016 27.

USA. 2019; 116 :7867-7872 Crossref Scopus (124) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Nanolumenal signaling could also play an important role in normal development and homeostasis. In normal mammary epithelia, there are interdigitating structures similar to the nanolumina characterized here, but whose function has remained unknown ( Ewald et al., 2012 18. Ewald, A.J. ∙ Huebner, R.J. ∙ Palsdottir, H. ... Mammary collective cell migration involves transient loss of epithelial features and individual cell migration within the epithelium J. Cell Sci. 2012; 125 :2638-2654 Crossref Scopus (128) PubMed Google Scholar ). The regulation of epigen signaling during phases of metastatic outgrowth and migration suggest parallels with the proliferation and collective migration of developing mammary terminal end buds ( Macias and Hinck, 2012 48.

Visvader, J.E. ∙ Stingl, J. Mammary stem cells and the differentiation hierarchy: current status and perspectives Genes Dev. 2014; 28 :1143-1158 Crossref Scopus (414) PubMed Google Scholar ). Likewise, the enrichment of genes related to labyrinthine placental morphogenesis ( Rinkenberger and Werb, 2000 65. Rinkenberger, J. ∙ Werb, Z. The labyrinthine placenta Nat. Genet. 2000; 25 :248-250 Crossref Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ) in BL2 cancer cells may hint at a primordial developmental role for nanolumina that is being co-opted during metastasis, analogous to the co-option of EMT programs in mesenchymal cancer cells ( Dongre and Weinberg, 2019 16. Dongre, A. ∙ Weinberg, R.A. New insights into the mechanisms of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and implications for cancer Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2019; 20 :69-84 Crossref Scopus (2334) PubMed Google Scholar ; Nieto et al., 2016 59. Nieto, M.A. ∙ Huang, R.Y. ∙ Jackson, R.A. ... EMT: 2016 Cell. 2016; 166 :21-45 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (3382) PubMed Google Scholar ). Future studies are warranted to interrogate nanolumen signaling in normal and cancer contexts and to develop approaches to therapeutically target nanolumina in collective metastasis.

All mice were maintained under specific-pathogen-free conditions, and experiments conformed to the guidelines as approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC). FVB/N-Tg(MMTV-PyVT)634Mul/J (MMTV-PyMT) were maintained and tumor growth was monitored every 2 days. MMTV-PyMT mice were crossed with ROSA mTomato/mGFP mice (Gt(ROSA)26Sor tm4(ACTB-tdTomato,-EGFP)Luo /J) to generate mTmG-PyMT mice with mTomato+ cell membranes. For injection experiments, immunocompromised NSG mice (NOD.Cg-Prkdc scid Il2rg tm1Wjl /SzJ) were used. 6-15 week old female mice were used for all procedures.
Deidentified human breast cancer primary or metastatic samples were received from (1) the Cooperative Human Tissues Network, a program funded by the National Cancer Institute, shipped overnight on wet ice or (2) received same day from the University of Washington/Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, with patients consented and samples obtained under a Fred Hutch IRB approved study (FH5306). Tumor samples were processed as previously described to generate organoids ( Nguyen-Ngoc et al., 2012 57. Nguyen-Ngoc, K.V. ∙ Cheung, K.J. ∙ Brenot, A. ... ECM microenvironment regulates collective migration and local dissemination in normal and malignant mammary epithelium Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109 :E2595-E2604 Crossref Scopus (341) PubMed Google Scholar ), detailed below. Blood and ascites fluid were collected from patients consented and samples obtained under a Fred Hutch IRB approved study (FH8649) for longitudinal monitoring of circulating tumor cells in metastatic breast cancer patients. CTCs and CTC-clusters were enumerated in these fluid samples using a RareCyte assay ( Kaldjian et al., 2018 34. Kaldjian, E.P. ∙ Ramirez, A.B. ∙ Sun, Y. ... The RareCyte® platform for next-generation analysis of circulating tumor cells Cytometry A. 2018; 93 :1220-1225 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ). For details on the receptor status and pathology of each deidentified human sample used, see Table S1 .
293FT (ThermoFisher Scientific R70007), MDA-MB-231-YFP (generated from ATCC HTB-26), CAL-85-1 (DSMZ ACC 440), HDQ-P1 (DSMZ ACC 494), and MDA-MB-436 (ATCC HTB-130) cell lines were grown at 37°C, 5% CO 2 in DMEM high glucose (GIBCO 10569-010) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich F0926-500ML) and 1X penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich P4333). BT549 (ATCC HTB-122) and HCC70 (ATCC CRL2315) cell lines were grown at 37°C, 5% CO 2 in RPMI (GIBCO 61870-127) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich F0926-500ML) and 1X penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich P4333). For non-adherent culture, cell lines were cultured in complete media + 2% (v/v) Matrigel. All cell lines used were from human females. MDA-MB-231-YFP cells were a gift from Cyrus Ghajar.
For single cell versus cluster experiments, mTomato-PyMT organoids were dissociated to single cells at day 0 using Accumax (20 minutes at 37°C). 200,000 cells in 200 μL DPBS were injected per mouse in the tail vein. To generate clusters, single cells were plated in non-adherent dishes at 150,000 cells/mL in media +2% basement membrane-rich gel (v/v) and then injected as above 6 h or 24 h later into Nod scid gamma (NSG) immunocompromised mice. shRNA knockdown injections were all carried out with 24 h aggregated clusters. DIC images were taken before injection and assessed to ensure similar number and size of clusters injected between conditions. 3 weeks after tail vein injection mice were euthanized and lungs imaged under a dissecting microscope for quantification of fluorescent (metastatic) area. For intracardiac injections, 100,000 mTomato-PyMT clustered cells were injected into the left ventricle in 100 μL of PBS using a 26 g needle with ultrasound guidance with 2.5% isoflurane anesthesia. 6 weeks later the brain, liver, lung, femur, kidneys, and ovaries were collected. Collected organs were fixed in 4% PFA for 4 h, then transferred to 25% sucrose in DPBS overnight at 4°C before embedding in OCT and storing at −80°C.
Organoids were isolated from MMTV-PyMT, C3(1)TAg, or MMTV-Neu mouse mammary tumors as previously described ( Nguyen-Ngoc et al., 2015 58. Nguyen-Ngoc, K.V. ∙ Shamir, E.R. ∙ Huebner, R.J. ... 3D culture assays of murine mammary branching morphogenesis and epithelial invasion Methods Mol. Biol. 2015; 1189 :135-162 Crossref Scopus (98) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mice were harvested as the largest tumor neared 1.5 cm in diameter. MMTV-PyMT mammary tumors were dissected, mechanically disrupted with a scalpel, and then digested in a collagenase-trypsin solution for 30-60 minutes shaking at an angle at 100-150 rpm at 37°C. The digestion solution (in 20 mL of DMEM/F12) contained 2 mg/mL collagenase (Sigma C2139), 2mg/mL trypsin (GIBCO 27250–018), 5% fetal bovine serum, 5 μg/mL human insulin (Sigma-Aldrich I9278), and 50 μg/mL gentamicin (GIBCO 15750-060). Tumor fragments were centrifuged for 10 minutes at 1500 rpm, resuspended in 4 mL DMEM/F12 and treated with 40 μL (2000 U/mL) of DNase (Sigma D4263) for 3 minutes then resuspended in 10mL DMEM/F12. The solution was centrifuged for 4 s at 1500 rpm (453 g) to isolate multicellular organoids, then resuspended in 10 mL DMEM/F12. This was repeated for a total of 4 washes. For 3D culture, 100-200 clusters were embedded in 100 μL of growth-factor reduced Matrigel (Corning), the Matrigel was allowed to polymerize for 30-60 minutes at 37°C, then 1 mL of organoid media (DMEM-F12, 2.5 nM FGF2, insulin-transferrin selenium, & penicillin/streptomycin) was added. For suspension culture, clusters were cultured in non-adherent dishes in organoid media + 2% (v/v) Matrigel (which we term low basement membrane suspension culture). Tips and tubes used to handle organoids were first coated in 2.5% BSA in DPBS to prevent loss of material. To create single cell suspensions, organoids were centrifuged, resuspended in Accumax (Innovative Cell Technologies) for 20 minutes at 37°C, and counted on a hemocytometer to ensure a low number of residual clusters.
Human cell lines were cultured in complete media (DMEM high glucose or RPMI with penicillin/streptomycin + 10% FBS) on tissue-culture treated plates, or in non-adherent plates supplemented with 2% Matrigel (v/v). To assess migration in 2D, 100,000 viable cells in 10 μL media were seeded as a droplet at the center of a Collagen I coated 24 well plate. After 30 minutes at 37°C, 1 mL of complete media was added. Tiled DIC and GFP images were taken 1 day and 6 days after plating. Deidentified human breast cancer primary or metastatic samples were received from the Cooperative Human Tissues Network and the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance. Tumor samples were processed as previously described to generate organoids ( Nguyen-Ngoc et al., 2012 57. Nguyen-Ngoc, K.V. ∙ Cheung, K.J. ∙ Brenot, A. ... ECM microenvironment regulates collective migration and local dissemination in normal and malignant mammary epithelium Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109 :E2595-E2604 Crossref Scopus (341) PubMed Google Scholar ). Samples were washed with DPBS containing 200 U/mL penicillin/200 μg/mL streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich P4333) and 5 μg/mL Amphotericin B (ThermoFisher Scientific 15290-018). They were then minced with a scalpel and resuspended in digestion solution. The digestion solution (in 40 mL of DMEM/F12) contained 2 mg/mL collagenase (Sigma C2139), 5% fetal bovine serum, 1X penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich P4333), and 5 μg/mL human insulin (Sigma-Aldrich I9278). Samples were incubated at 37°C shaking at 200 rpm for 2-5 hours. Tumor fragments were centrifuged for 10 minutes at 1500 rpm, resuspended in 4 mL DMEM/F12 and treated with 40 μL (2000 U/mL) of DNase (Sigma D4263) for 3 minutes then resuspended in fresh 10mL DMEM/F12. The solution was centrifuged for 4 s at 1500 rpm (453 g) to isolate multicellular organoids. Human organoids were cultured with 2% (v/v) or 100% growth factor reduced Matrigel (Corning) with complete HuMEC Ready media (Fisher 12752010).
3 weeks after tail vein injection, lungs were removed and imaged under a dissecting microscope. Bright field and DsRed images were taken for all experiments using mTomato-PyMT cells, GFP images were collected for cells expressing GFP-shRNAs. To measure outgrowth in whole lungs or lung sections, fluorescence images were thresholded equally in FIJI software ( Schindelin et al., 2012 68. Schindelin, J. ∙ Arganda-Carreras, I. ∙ Frise, E. ... Fiji: an open-source platform for biological-image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :676-682 Crossref Scopus (40003) PubMed Google Scholar ) and total fluorescent area was measured. For each tail vein injected mouse, the total area of lung metastases was measured as the cm 2 GFP+ area in the lungs using FIJI software. For each animal, the total area of lung metastases was normalized by the mean total metastatic area of Ctrl-kd mice within each cohort of tail vein injections. This allowed the effect size of control versus gene knockdowns to be compared, accounting for intrinsic differences in organoid line growth rates between injections. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s Test for multiple comparisons. To measure individual metastasis areas, the area of each visible metastasis was measured manually using FIJI software. To identify and measure micrometastases, 50 um thick lung sections were imaged at 10X magnification, tiled, and assembled. Metastasis counts from lung sections were normalized to the area of the lung imaged.
Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (10 min), permeabilized 30 minutes with 0.5% Triton-X, and blocked 1-2 h at room temperature with 10% FBS/1% BSA/0.1% Triton-X in DPBS. For cells in suspension culture or in malignant ascites, cells were centrifuged onto tissue pathology slides using a Cytospin 4 (A78300003), 800 rpm for 5 minutes and then treated as above. Primary antibodies were added in block solution and incubated at 4°C overnight. Secondary antibodies (1:200) were incubated for 2-3 h at room temperature with 5% host serum. Confocal mages were acquired using an Andor CSU-W confocal spinning disk on a Leica DMi8 inverted microscope. For Leica 3X STED imaging, cells were stained with Alexa Fluor 594 Phalloidin (ThermoFisher Scientific A12381) and imaged using a Leica TCS SP8. DAPI was not included for STED imaging due to high background.
Single or clustered cells were plated in growth factor reduced basement membrane-rich gels. Differential interference contrast (DIC) and fluorescent images were captured hourly using a Leica SPE at 10X or 20X magnification. For growth assays, DIC images were acquired. For survival assays, 30 minutes before imaging NucView 488 (Biotium) in PBS was added to the media at 1:1000 to mark nuclei in cells with active executioner caspases. Exposure times were < 30ms for BF/DIC, and ∼150ms for fluorescence. Temperature was maintained at 37°C and CO 2 at 5%. Motility and NucView positivity were used to score apoptosis in single cells and clusters. Clusters were marked as dead when the large majority of cells had died; if a few cells were still alive in the apoptotic debris after most the cluster died, the cluster was not scored as alive. FIJI software was used to score the area of cells or clusters to measure outgrowth (as final area/initial area). Objects smaller than 250 μm 2 were scored as single cells (this cutoff may have occasionally included small MMTV-PyMT doublets). Images were acquired using a Leica DMi8 TCS SPE. For migration analysis, the centroid position of each individual organoid was tracked over time relative to static objects in the gel (e.g., debris). Each migration track was then normalized by the number of cells per organoid, determined by dividing the area of the organoid at time = 0 h by the mean μm 2 area per cell, which here we determined to be ∼76 μm 2 (n = 71 organoids, 8613 cells). Cumulative path was determined by summing over the path length of each migration track.
On day zero, 22,500 cells were plated in wells of a non-adherent 96 well plate at 100% knockdown, 90% knockdown/10% non-transduced (e.g., 20250 knockdown cells, 2250 non-transduced cells), 50% knockdown/50% non-transduced, or 10% knockdown/90% non-transduced. On day 6, each well was centrifuged and resuspended in Accumax for 20 minutes at 37°C. Dissociated single cells were resuspended in organoid media and plated in glass-bottomed 8-well plates, allowed to settle, then imaged at 40X magnification (at least 10 fields per well). GFP positive and negative cells were manually counted in each field. For GFP+ cell growth calculations, this measurement was normalized to the starting number of GFP+ knockdown cells plated.
Tumor cell clusters from cell lines, organoids, patient samples, or primary tumors (minced with a scalpel to < 1mm 3 ) were centrifuged, washed in DPBS, then fixed in 1/2 strength Karnovsky’s fixative (2% PFA/2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1M cacodylate buffer) at 4°C for at least 16 h. Samples were then processed by the Fred Hutchinson Cellular Imaging core. Samples were visualized using a JEOL-1400 transmission electron microscope operated at 120 kV. For ascites-derived samples, tumor cells were identified based on gross morphological differences from stromal and blood cells in the same sample, as well as by the presence of electron dense cell-cell junctions.
For pEGFR and epigen immunogold staining, MMTV-PyMT clusters were collected and fixed in 4% PFA. For HER2 immunogold staining, MMTV-PyMT clusters were collected in 4% PFA + 0.1% glutaraldehyde. Approximately 70nm ultra thin sections were picked up on nickel grids (from Ted Pella, Inc., performed by Fred Hutchinson Cellular Imaging core). Grids were blocked with 50 mM glycine for 20 minutes, washed in PBS 3 times, blocked in 5% BSA for 30 minutes, washed with incubation buffer (1% BSA-C, 0.16% Tween-20 in PBS) 6 × 4 minutes, incubated with primary antibody (R&D MAB11271, Abcam ab40815, or CST 2165) for 2 h in incubation buffer, washed in PBS 4 times, washed in incubation buffer 6 × 4 minutes, incubated with secondary antibody (10 nm gold goat-anti-rabbit or goat-anti-rat), washed in incubation buffer 10 × 4 minutes, post-fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde for 10 minutes, and washed in warm DI water. Samples were visualized using a JEOL-1400 transmission electron microscope with a Gatan Rio 4K camera. Images were compared against a negative control not incubated with primary antibody to ensure secondary specificity.
To test the permeability of tumor cell clusters, NHS-biotin was added to a final concentration of 0.8 mM in PBS for 30 minutes at 37°C. Treatment with 1mM EGTA, Latrunculin A, or Ochratoxin A was for 1 h, prior to biotin incubation. Treatment with interferon gamma was for 6 days prior to biotin permeability experiments. Cells were washed three times with cold PBS then centrifuged onto tissue pathology slides using a Cytospin 4 (800 rpm for 5 minutes) and fixed with 4% PFA for 10 minutes. Freshly dissected primary tumors or lungs were immersed in 0.8 mM sulfo-NHS-biotin in PBS for 30 minutes then washed 3 times with PBS prior to fixation and embedding in OCT. Immunofluorescence was conducted (as above) with FITC-conjugated streptavidin to localize biotin. Human breast cancer cell lines were cultured for 6 days as clusters in suspension before assessing biotin permeability.
Phalloidin staining and DAPI were used to define membrane and nuclear areas, respectively. Using the freehand line tool in FIJI software, lines along cell-matrix (outer membrane), cell-cell (intercellular) membranes, and intracellular (cytosolic) areas were drawn and median fluorescence intensity was measured for each channel. Values were normalized to cytosolic signal. For biotin leak-in assays, the freehand line tool was used to draw along the cell-matrix membranes of the cluster and measure FITC-streptavidin intensity. Then the polygon selection tool was used to measure FITC-streptavidin intensity in the cluster core (excluding the cell-matrix contacts) and in adjacent stromal regions. To assess biotin permeability in tumor versus stroma areas, mean FITC-streptavidin signal was measured in FIJI in equally sized squares in adjacent pure tumor or pure stroma areas. To score protrusive versus non-protrusive epigen immunofluorescence intensity, the polygon tool in FIJI software was used to measure epigen signal in locally disseminated mTomato+ PyMT clusters. Only protrusive and non-protrusive clusters in the same field of view were compared to one another, to account for differences in staining intensity between different regions of the tumor and different biological replicates. Protrusive clusters were identified based on the presence of strand-like organization and membrane protrusions. Non-protrusive clusters had more rounded organization and smooth borders. Clusters with intermediate or unclear morphology were not scored. Clusters with one type of morphology in one region, and another in a different region, were not scored. To count DAPI+ nuclei in clusters, a single confocal slice from the thickest part of the cluster was used. To assess cell death in clusters, propidium iodide (a fluorescent dye excluded from viable cells) was added to cell media at 0.5 μg/mL for 10 minutes prior to imaging.
Lentivirus was produced in HEK293FT cells using PsPax and MD2.G packaging plasmids for pLKO.1 ( Moffat et al., 2006 56. Moffat, J. ∙ Grueneberg, D.A. ∙ Yang, X. ... A lentiviral RNAi library for human and mouse genes applied to an arrayed viral high-content screen Cell. 2006; 124 :1283-1298 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1452) PubMed Google Scholar ), LentiCRISPRv2 ( Sanjana et al., 2014 67. Sanjana, N.E. ∙ Shalem, O. ∙ Zhang, F. Improved vectors and genome-wide libraries for CRISPR screening Nat. Methods. 2014; 11 :783-784 Crossref Scopus (3378) PubMed Google Scholar ), or lentiviral shRNA vectors (transOMIC). Supernatants were concentrated using Lenti-X (Clontech), resuspended in 1/100 th the supernatant volume of PBS, and frozen at −80°C. Viruses were titered using a p24 ELISA (Retrotek) Tumor organoids were dissociated to single cells in Accumax and resuspended at 150,000 viable cells/mL in organoid media + 2% (v/v) Matrigel. Protamine sulfate was added at 8ug/mL to enhance transduction efficiency. For plasmids with PuroR, 2 days after transduction puromycin was included in the media at 1-2 μg/mL for selection. Cells were maintained in puromycin for at least 5 days before experiments and puromycin was included in the media throughout ex vivo culture. CRISPR sgRNA transduced cells were kept in puromycin at least 10 days before conducting experiments.
The R&D Proteome Profiler Mouse Phospho-RTK Array Kit (R&D ARY014) was performed according to manufacturer instructions using 125 μg of dissociated single cell or clustered (6 h aggregation) MMTV-PyMT lysates. X-ray film was exposed to membranes for 1 to 10 minutes. To quantify signal, the pixel intensity of each coordinate was measured using FIJI software for film scans in which the signal was not over or under exposed. The signal of the negative control (PBS) was then subtracted from each measurement.
Clusters were lysed in RIPA buffer with protease and phosphatase inhibitors for 30 minutes at 4°C and then centrifuged (15 minutes at 12000 g). Clusters were cultured in 2% basement membrane suspension prior to lysate collection. Protein concentration was quantified using a BCA assay (Pierce), lysates were loaded onto a 4%–12% Bis-Tris NuPage protein gel. Semi-dry transfers (iBlot2, P3 5-8min) were performed using PVDF membranes which were then blocked with 5% BSA in TBST for 1 h. Primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4°C in 1% BSA in TBST, diluted 1:1000. Species specific LI-COR 680 and 800 secondary antibodies were used in TBST plus 1% BSA. Primary antibodies used: ERK1/2 (CST 4695), pERK1/2 (CST 4370), pAkt (CST 4060), Akt (CST 4691), beta-tubulin (Abcam ab40815), EGFR (Millipore 06-847). Band intensity was measured using the “Analyze Gels” tool in FIJI software, relative to beta-tubulin as a loading control.
MMTV-PyMT-mTomato organoids were resuspended in 50% basement membrane-rich gel in DMEM/F12 (vol/vol) on ice. 9-15 week old NSG mice were anesthetized with 2.5% isoflurane and the surgical site was sterilized with ethanol and chlorhexidine. A 1 cm midline incision was made, allowing the #4 mammary fat pad to be exposed. 50,000 clustered cells per gland (aggregated at 250,000 viable cells/mL overnight) were injected into the left and right #4 mammary gland. The surgical area was locally infiltrated with 0.25% bupivacaine for pain relief. Surgical wounds were closed with 9mm autoclips and tissue glue. Triple antibiotic ointment was applied to the incision. Mice were monitored closely with autoclip removal two weeks after surgery. Tumor volume was estimated based on caliper measurements as: (4/3) x (π) x (width/2) x (width/2) x (length/2). At endpoint weeks, mice were euthanized, and primary tumors and lungs were fixed in 4% PFA for 4 h, then transferred to 25% sucrose in DPBS overnight at 4°C before embedding in OCT and storing at −80°C. Lung metastases were quantified using a fluorescence dissecting microscope at endpoint. Ctrl-kd and Epgn-kd tumors were harvested at the same time, when the first Ctrl-kd tumors reached the maximum allowable size (15 mm diameter).
MMTV-PyMT cells or clusters in suspension culture (non-adherent plates in media +2% Corning Matrigel) were collected for RNA extraction. Cells were pelleted 5 min at 300 g then resuspended in 1mL of Trizol. Samples were incubated at room temperature for 5 min to ensure lysis, and then stored at −20°C. RNA samples were quantified using Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer and RNA integrity was checked with Agilent TapeStation (Agilent, RIN range 8.7 to 9.3). RNA sequencing libraries were prepared by GENEWIZ using the NEBNext Ultra RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina following manufacturer’s instructions. The sequencing libraries were validated on the Agilent TapeStation and quantified by using Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer as well as by quantitative PCR (KAPA Biosystems, Wilmington, MA, USA). The sequencing libraries were clustered on 1 lane of a flowcell. After clustering, the flowcell was loaded on the Illumina HiSeq instrument (4000 or equivalent) according to manufacturer’s instructions. The samples were sequenced using a 2x150bp Paired End (PE) configuration. Image analysis and base calling were conducted by the HiSeq Control Software (HCS).
Raw sequence data (.bcl files) generated from Illumina HiSeq were converted into fastq files and de-multiplexed using Illumina’s bcl2fastq 2.17 software. One mismatch was allowed for index sequence identification. Raw sequencing data was demultiplexed to generate two fastq files per sample with between 24.1 to 32.7 million reads per sample. Kallisto pseudoalignment v0.46.0 ( Bray et al., 2016 7. Bray, N.L. ∙ Pimentel, H. ∙ Melsted, P. ... Near-optimal probabilistic RNA-seq quantification Nat. Biotechnol. 2016; 34 :525-527 Crossref Scopus (5206) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used for transcript abundance estimation, and differential transcript expression analysis was performed using Sleuth v0.30.0 ( Pimentel et al., 2017 62. Pimentel, H. ∙ Bray, N.L. ∙ Puente, S. ... Differential analysis of RNA-seq incorporating quantification uncertainty Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :687-690 Crossref Scopus (879) PubMed Google Scholar ). Kallisto was run with bootstrap-samples = 100, and the transcript target was Ensembl (release 97) Mus musculus transcriptome (Mus_musculus.GRCm38.cdna.all.fa). For gene-level analyses, aggregated transcripts per million (TPM) scaled using the average transcript length and averaged over samples and to library size were generated with tximport and were used in further downstream differential gene expression analysis using limma-voom.
To visualize expression dynamics, genes were sequentially ordered in the dataset by their time-point of maximum expression, mean-variance normalized, and clustered together by time-point of maximum expression. Gene cluster enriched biological processes and signaling pathways were identified using Metascape ( Zhou et al., 2019 80. Zhou, Y. ∙ Zhou, B. ∙ Pache, L. ...

Epigen ELISAs were performed according to manufacturer instructions (R&D DuoSet) using MMTV-PyMT single cell or day 1 cluster (18 h aggregation) lysates in RIPA buffer diluted at least 5-fold in ELISA reagent diluent. At least 30 μg of total protein was loaded. Recombinant epigen (R&D 1127-EP) was used as a standard. Antibodies MAB11271 (R&D) and AF1127 (R&D) were used for coating and detection, respectively.
Human or mouse tumor cell clusters were pelleted and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. RNA was extracted using an RNeasy mini kit (QIAGEN). 250ng-1μg of RNA was used to generate cDNA with a SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis kit (ThermoFisher) with oligo(dT) primers. RT-qPCR was performed using PowerUp SYBR Green master mix in 10-20 μL reactions on a QuantStudio 5 real-time PCR instrument. Pre-designed Millipore Sigma KiCqStart™ primers were used ( https://www.kicqstart-primers-sigmaaldrich.com/KiCqStartPrimers.php ), primer pair IDs can be found in the Key Resources Table . Data were analyzed using the ΔΔCt method.
