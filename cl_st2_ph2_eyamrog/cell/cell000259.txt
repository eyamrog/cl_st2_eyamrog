Title: Shared Immunogenic Poly-Epitope Frameshift Mutations in Microsatellite Unstable Tumors


Abstract: Summary

Microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) tumors are characterized by high tumor mutation burden and responsiveness to checkpoint blockade. We identified tumor-specific frameshifts encoding multiple epitopes that originated from indel mutations shared among patients with MSI-H endometrial, colorectal, and stomach cancers. Epitopes derived from these shared frameshifts have high population occurrence rates, wide presence in many tumor subclones, and are predicted to bind to the most frequent MHC alleles in MSI-H patient cohorts. Neoantigens arising from these mutations are distinctly unlike self and viral antigens, signifying novel groups of potentially highly immunogenic tumor antigens. We further confirmed the immunogenicity of frameshift peptides in T cell stimulation experiments using blood mononuclear cells isolated from both healthy donors and MSI-H cancer patients. Our study uncovers the widespread occurrence and strong immunogenicity of tumor-specific antigens derived from shared frameshift mutations in MSI-H cancer and Lynch syndrome patients, suitable for the design of common “off-the-shelf” cancer vaccines.

Section: Introduction

Genetic alterations in tumor genomes that encode novel stretches of amino acids compared to normal cells are a potential source of immunogenic tumor-specific epitopes, commonly referred to as neoantigens. Total neoantigen burden, the sum of neoantigens predicted to be expressed by a tumor, has been demonstrated to be an independent proxy for response to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy ( Snyder et al., 2014 51.

However, determining neoepitopes in individual tumor samples remains fraught with uncertainties, such as the lack of congruence between neoantigen prediction pipelines. Microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) tumors have high tumor burdens accompanied by effector T cell infiltration and are more responsive to checkpoint inhibitor therapy, making them suitable models to investigate neoantigen-based immune therapies ( Mandal et al., 2019 36.

Cancer Res. 2020; 26 :11-17 Crossref Scopus (59) PubMed Google Scholar ). The MSI-H tumor phenotype arises from defective DNA repair mechanisms due to a loss of mismatch repair (MMR) activity. MSI-H is typically characterized by the variation of DNA length in microsatellite loci—units of one to ten mono-, di-, tri-, or tetra-nucleotides repeated multiple times ( Kim et al., 2013 29. Kim, T.M. ∙ Laird, P.W. ∙ Park, P.J. The landscape of microsatellite instability in colorectal and endometrial cancer genomes Cell. 2013; 155 :858-868 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (276) PubMed Google Scholar ). In healthy cells, these unpaired nucleotides are recognized and excised by MMR, but in MSI-H tumors they remain unrepaired. Some of these microsatellite regions are located in coding regions, where their destabilization can cause frameshift (fs-) mutations that shift an open reading frame, thereby providing a substantial source of tumor-specific neoantigens ( Turajlic et al., 2017 54.

Hematol. 2013; 88 :154-167 Crossref Scopus (98) PubMed Google Scholar ). The sporadic form of MSI-H tumors occurs in 10%–40% of colorectal and endometrial cancers and is mainly caused by biallelic hypermethylation of the MLH1 promoter ( Cunningham et al., 1998 16.

USA. 1998; 95 :8698-8702 Crossref Scopus (567) PubMed Google Scholar ). Lynch syndrome, sometimes referred to as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNCC), is an inherited, autosomal-dominant disorder characterized by germline non-synonymous mutations in MMR genes. The majority of Lynch syndrome patients have germline mutations in MSH2 (∼30%) and PMS2 (∼70%) genes ( Gatalica et al., 2016 23. Gatalica, Z. ∙ Vranic, S. ∙ Xiu, J. ... High microsatellite instability (MSI-H) colorectal carcinoma: a brief review of predictive biomarkers in the era of personalized medicine Fam. Cancer. 2016; 15 :405-412 Crossref Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ). Estimates suggest that as many as 1 in every 300 people may carry Lynch syndrome-associated germline alterations ( Carethers and Stoffel, 2015 9. Carethers, J.M. ∙ Stoffel, E.M.

Genet. 2019; 20 :293-307 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ). Lynch syndrome patients have an 80% lifetime risk for developing colorectal or endometrial MSI-H cancers, accounting for 3%–5% of all colorectal and endometrial cancers. The most common cancer associated with sporadic and hereditary-predisposed MSI-H type is colorectal cancer (80% of HNCC patients), followed by endometrial carcinoma (60% of HNCC patients). The MSI-H group accounts for up to 28.6% of low-grade and 54.3% of high-grade endometrioid cancers. Although less common, the MSI-H phenotype is also observed in other cancers such as bladder, gastric, ovarian, small bowel, and renal due to a hereditary-predisposition ( Vasen et al., 1996 57. Vasen, H.F. ∙ Wijnen, J.T. ∙ Menko, F.H. ... Cancer risk in families with hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer diagnosed by mutation analysis Gastroenterology. 1996; 110 :1020-1027 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (722) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Most neoantigens that are predicted from non-synonymous point mutations are derived from patient-specific passenger mutations, because recurrent driver mutations infrequently generate immunogenic peptides ( Marty et al., 2017 38. Marty, R. ∙ Kaabinejadian, S. ∙ Rossell, D. ... MHC-I Genotype Restricts the Oncogenic Mutational Landscape Cell. 2017; 171 :1272-1283 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (243) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, neoantigens expressed in the MSI-H phenotype are distinguished by unique features, namely, (1) a high mutational burden in well-defined, limited sequence spaces—namely microsatellite regions, and (2) a restricted pattern of mutations due to nucleotide insertions or deletions (indels). This feature combination can induce a bottleneck, causing a high probability of shared indel mutations in protein-coding genes, leading to frameshift (fs-) peptides encoding multiple MHC-I-restricted epitopes (poly-epitope fs-peptide) likely to be common among multiple patients. Based on this premise, we investigated fs-mutations in the tumor genomes of MSI-H patients with colorectal, stomach, and endometrial carcinomas and identified broadly shared, immunogenic, poly-epitope fs-peptides. Our study provides a foundation for the potential application of these shared epitopes in “off-the-shelf” vaccines.

Section: Results

To interrogate the relationship between MSI status and fs-load, we utilized tumor whole exome sequencing (WES) data available at the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Although the majority of TCGA tumors are microsatellite stable or their status is unknown, ∼20%–30% of endometrial, colorectal, and stomach adenocarcinomas (UCEC, COAD, and STAD, respectively) are diagnosed as microsatellite unstable (MSI-H). In total, the MSI-H population in TCGA accounts for 338 patients ( Figures 1 A and 1B). Similar to previous studies ( Mlecnik et al., 2016 40. Mlecnik, B. ∙ Bindea, G. ∙ Angell, H.K. ...

Insertion-and-deletion-derived tumour-specific neoantigens and the immunogenic phenotype: a pan-cancer analysis Lancet Oncol. 2017; 18 :1009-1021 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (671) PubMed Google Scholar ), we first annotated somatic mutation load on a pan-cancer scale and observed specific mutation frequencies vary across different tumor types ( Figure S1 A). However, the average frameshift (fs-) load, as determined by frameshift count per each patient, was selectively elevated in a subset of UCEC, COAD, and STAD patients ( Figure 1 C). When we stratified UCEC, COAD, and STAD patients according to MSI status, the majority of high fs-load patients overlapped with the MSI-H clinical biomarker, indicating a high specificity/selectivity of this biomarker in detecting indel-enriched tumor types ( Figure 1 D). Consistent with previous studies, most frameshifts stemmed from nucleotide deletions, as determined by correlating patients’ fs-load with insertion-to-deletion ratio ( Figure 1 E).
Although tumor evolution is primarily regarded as driven by random mutational processes, there is accumulating evidence that some loci acquire mutations preferentially ( Martincorena et al., 2017 37. Martincorena, I. ∙ Raine, K.M. ∙ Gerstung, M. ...

Cancer-mutation network and the number and specificity of driver mutations Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115 :E6010-E6019 Crossref Scopus (84) PubMed Google Scholar ). Given the existing skewing in the underlying mutational process and the high occurrence of indel mutations in microsatellite regions within open reading frames ( Cortes-Ciriano et al., 2017 15. Cortes-Ciriano, I. ∙ Lee, S. ∙ Park, W.Y. ... A molecular portrait of microsatellite instability across multiple cancers Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :15180 Crossref Scopus (434) PubMed Google Scholar ), we hypothesized MSI-H patients could share frameshift events. Although missense somatic mutations share limited similarity across multiple tumors ( Schumacher and Schreiber, 2015 47. Schumacher, T.N. ∙ Schreiber, R.D. Neoantigens in cancer immunotherapy Science. 2015; 348 :69-74 Crossref Scopus (3602) PubMed Google Scholar ), we found fs-mutations in microsatellite (MS) unstable regions are likely to generate common fs-peptides when translated ( Figure 1 F). To gain an understanding of shared mutational events, we examined mutational load in cancer cell lines from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) ( Barretina et al., 2012 5. Barretina, J. ∙ Caponigro, G. ∙ Stransky, N. ... The Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia enables predictive modelling of anticancer drug sensitivity Nature. 2012; 483 :603-607 Crossref Scopus (5623) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ghandi et al., 2019 24. Ghandi, M. ∙ Huang, F.W. ∙ Jané-Valbuena, J. ... Next-generation characterization of the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia Nature. 2019; 569 :503-508 Crossref Scopus (1784) PubMed Google Scholar ) and found fs-mutations are shared among multiple cancer cell lines far more frequently than missense mutations. Intriguingly, cell lines derived from tumor types frequently displaying an MSI-H phenotype (stomach, colon, and endometrial) tend to share fs-events more often than cell lines derived from other tissues ( Figure S1 B).
To identify potentially immunogenic epitopes derived from fs-mutations, we developed an fs-neoantigen calling pipeline (see STAR Methods ). Using this pipeline, we analyzed the distribution of fs-mutations, fs-peptides, and corresponding fs-epitopes in MSI-H UCEC, COAD, and STAD cohorts of TCGA patients ( Figure 2 A; Tables S1 and S2 ). We found many genes that were commonly mutated via indels in MS regions of all three tumor types. Up to 80% of MSI-H COAD and STAD patients shared genes commonly mutated in the form of MSI-derived indels (fs-genes), including ACVR2A , MIKI67 , and RPL22 . Similarly, the top-listed shared frameshifted genes in >50% of MSI-H UCEC and COAD patients include CASP5 , MUC6 , and KMT2C . As expected, the frequency of shared fs-peptides—mutation events derived from exactly the same fs-mutation—was lower. Only a few fs-peptides were shared among >40% of MSI-H UCEC (e.g., RPL22 and SETD1B ), 50% of MSI-H COAD patients (e.g., SGOL1 , SEC31A , and ACVR2A ) or >50% of MSI-H STAD patients (e.g., RPL22 and ACVR2A ). Finally, the top-frequency of shared MHC class I epitopes was around 30% of MSI-H UCEC patients (e.g., OR7E24 , MSYFPILFF epitope), around 60% of MSI-H COAD patients (e.g., SGOL1 , LIWKRVFIL epitope), and around 50% MSI-H STAD patients (e.g., RNF43 , RFFPITPPV epitope) ( Figure 2 A). Interestingly, the average frequency of shared fs-gene, fs-peptide, and fs-neoepitope events in colon and stomach MSI-H tumors was twice as high compared to endometrial MSI-H tumors, possibly due to how different pathways of tumorigenesis and rates of cell growth may affect the rate of MS-related mutagenesis.
To identify immunogenic fs-peptides with confidence, we developed a mutation ranking system based on the maximization of four parameters. First, we introduced a somatic score for each fs-mutation, where a higher score implies higher confidence that this mutation is truly somatic. We analyzed the distribution of fs-peptide lengths: on average, the length of MSI-H frameshift peptides was 20–30 amino acid (aa) residues, suggesting these peptides may encode multiple immunogenic epitopes per fs-mutation ( Figure S2 ). Taking this into account, we maximized the number of putative neoepitopes per each fs-peptide: epitopes, predicted for each fs-peptide across all patients, were pooled, and the total number of unique epitopes was determined. Third, we grouped all MHC alleles predicted to bind those neoepitopes. Maximization of this parameter allowed us to pick poly-allelic fs-peptides, covering a diverse set of alleles in a population. Finally, to include the population MHC allele frequency parameter, we quantified the total amount of peptide-MHC (pMHC) interactions per frameshift ( Figure 2 B), together enabling the selection of fs-peptides that are likely immunogenic, encode poly-epitopes, bind a broad spectrum of MHC-I alleles, and are widely shared. Applying these selection parameters to fs-mutations shared by at least 20% of MSI-H patients, we identified 9, 37, and 23 shared fs-peptides that encode poly-epitopes in endometrial, colorectal, and stomach MSI-H patients, respectively ( Figures 2 B and S2 ; Table S2 ). Altogether, this fs-peptide set accounted for 46 unique peptide sequences with broad epitope mapping ( Figure 2 C), 5 of which, SLC35F5, SEC31A, TTK, SETD1B, and RNF43, were shared among all MSI-H UCEC, COAD, and STAD patients analyzed.
We next focused on frameshift-derived neoantigens from MSI-H endometrial carcinoma, because these have not been well characterized to date. To assess the distribution of shared fs-neoantigens in patients and determine the MHC class I alleles they bind to, we analyzed epitopes derived from the 9 MSI-H UCEC shared fs-peptides. The majority of the analyzed tumor specimens (>95% of the MSI-H UCEC patient cohort) potentially encoded neoepitopes derived from at least 2 fs-peptides (out of the 9). Importantly, the combination of neoepitope-yielding fs-peptides may vary depending on the patient. For example, SEC31A and ASTE1 fs-neoantigens were frequently found in the same patients together. Shared fs-neoantigens were predicted to bind to multiple frequently occurring MHC class I alleles (e.g., A0201, B0801, and C0701/02), as well as a spectrum of less frequent ones ( Figure 2 D). Importantly, only the “mixture” of fs-epitopes derived from all 9 peptides has the potential to reach a good representation in all possible pMHC interactions per each MHC-I allele ( Figure 3 A). Together, our data demonstrate the presence of shared poly-epitope fs-peptides across MSI-H UCEC, COAD, and STAD patients, suggesting the possibility of developing an off-the-shelf MSI-H vaccine for these three tumor types.
In addition to MHC-I binding affinity predictions, expression and abundance of neoantigens are also important correlates of immunogenicity. To better evaluate the immunogenic potential of fs-peptides, we analyzed tumor allele frequencies from the MSI-H UCEC patient cohort to estimate the abundance of the selected nine shared frameshifts. We compared corresponding fs-allele frequencies in normal and tumor samples and found that although they were almost non-detectable in normal tissues, in tumor biopsies their allele frequencies rose to 30%–40% on average, suggesting these mutations were present in substantial fractions of the tumors ( Figure 3 B). The same conclusion was also made from orthogonal mutation recalling of selected WES matched tumor/normal datasets ( Figures S2 and S3 ; Table S1 ). This suggests the combination of 9 fs-peptides has the potential to prime T cell responses that recognize the majority of the malignant cells in MSI-H UCEC tumors. The high mutation rates of MSI-H tumors might decrease the probability of shared fs-peptides being correctly translated. Therefore, we assessed the conditional probability of shared fs-peptides being correctly translated. For this purpose, we estimated all disruptive upstream and downstream mutation frequencies using TCGA MSI-H cohort and calculated their posterior probabilities. MSI-H UCEC shared fs-peptides had a high probability of being correctly translated, with an ∼0.8 probability for TTK and RNF43 and >0.9 probability for the remaining frameshifts ( Figure S2 ).
To determine whether genes encoding shared fs-peptides were expressed, we analyzed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) from samples of MSI-H patients in TCGA and mass spectrometry (MS) data utilizing the COAD and UCEC datasets from the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) ( Zhang et al., 2014 65.

Unsupervised clustering of MSI-H patients was performed focusing on genes with predicted shared fs-events. We also plotted fragments per kilobase of transcript per million (FPKM) expression values of genes encoding shared fs-peptides and ranked them according to the previously obtained patient and gene rankings ( Figure 3 C). We observed no correlation between RNA expression and shared fs-load ( Figure 3 D), suggesting that frameshifted genes were not selectively epigenetically silenced in tumors. Considering the latter results, we analyzed the expression of nine shared fs-mutations in MSI-H UCEC patients. Of note, each fs-mutation was detected in a different fs-gene, except two, both of which occurred in one fs-gene, TTK. Therefore, formally we detected 8 uniquely mutated genes. Six of these fs-genes were expressed at the RNA level from matching tumor samples. To assess the expression level of fs-alleles, we compared the normalized read count containing an indel with the total amount of reads covering the targeted genomic loci utilizing RNA-seq samples from MSI-H (n = 270) and MSS (n = 200) patients used as controls. Basically, we performed variant allele frequency estimation from RNA-seq samples with expression normalization. We detected significant and robust expression of fs-alleles in MSI-H patients compared to MSS patients ( Figure 3 E). Indel reads were also detected in RNA-seq samples of MSS patients as well. We attribute this to either higher mutability of reverse-transcriptase applied during RNA-seq protocols or imperfect MSI-H classification. Further confirming the expression of fs-peptides in tumors, we identified many shared fs-mutations in COAD and UCEC genomic samples collected through CPTAC. In addition to confirming the genomic presence of the underlying fs-mutation, predicted fs-peptides were therefore detected as protein as well ( Figures 3 F, 3G, and S4 ; Table S2 ). Taken together, we confirmed shared fs-mutations are not epigenetically silenced and have the potential of being correctly expressed within tumors.
We next examined the intrinsic properties of fs-derived epitopes compared to missense-derived epitopes and viral antigens. Tumor-derived neoantigens can have broad similarities to pathogen-derived (viral) antigens, and their expression may promote the response to checkpoint therapy ( Łuksza et al., 2017 34.

Biol. 2019; 2 :135 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ). To understand how fs-derived or missense-derived neoepitopes relate to viral antigens we compared both types of neoantigens to the viral antigens present in The Immune Epitope Database (IEDB). We first calculated the total number of neoantigens derived from missense and frameshift mutations of MSI-H patients. Even though the total frameshift and missense neoantigen loads were similar, the number of predicted MHC-I epitopes per mutation was different: 4 epitopes per one frameshift and 2 per one missense mutation on average ( Figure S5 ). This observation is consistent with the idea that fs-mutations may be more immunogenic than missense mutations due to an increased probability of generating neoantigens. Although many missense-derived epitopes are, by definition, one amino acid different from a self-peptide, the majority of fs-derived epitopes are unique, “non-self” peptide sequences and hence exhibit less similarity to the human proteome ( Figure S5 ). This implies that fs-derived epitopes are unlikely to have been tolerized by the host immune system, and the frameshift-specific T cells will have little or minimal autoreactivity. We also compared these two epitope datasets with virus-derived antigens. At different blastp search stringency, the overall number of missense epitopes matched with viral epitopes was 3 times higher than matched fs-epitopes ( Figure S5 ). We speculate this observation is due to the overall viral adaptation to the human proteome and host T cell epitopes, because viruses mimic particular host functionalities in order to interact with the host cellular machinery as well as to escape host immune recognition. Therefore, fs-epitopes appear “less-self’ than either missense or virus-derived epitopes, and are likely of higher “quality” as a result ( Balachandran et al., 2017 4. Balachandran, V.P. ∙ Łuksza, M. ∙ Zhao, J.N. ..., Australian Pancreatic Cancer Genome Initiative, Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Prince of Wales Hospital, Royal North Shore Hospital, University of Glasgow, St Vincent’s Hospital, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, University of Melbourne, Centre for Cancer Research, University of Queensland, Institute for Molecular Bioscience, Bankstown Hospital, Liverpool Hospital, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Chris O’Brien Lifehouse, Westmead Hospital, Fremantle Hospital, St John of God Healthcare, Royal Adelaide Hospital, Flinders Medical Centre, Envoi Pathology, Princess Alexandria Hospital, Austin Hospital, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutes, ARC-Net Centre for Applied Research on Cancer Identification of unique neoantigen qualities in long-term survivors of pancreatic cancer Nature. 2017; 551 :512-516 Crossref Scopus (819) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To validate the presence of predicted shared fs-mutations in an external dataset, we queried cell lines in the CCLE ( Figure 4 ; Table S3 ). 34 of 46 shared poly-epitope fs-mutations were detected in multiple cancer cell lines derived from different tumor types. The number of detected shared fs-mutations, however, differed across cancer cell lines. Lines derived from intestine, endometrium, stomach, and prostate cancers had 5–10 shared fs-mutations each, whereas hematopoietic, ovarian, and lung cancer cell lines had 1–5 ( Figure 4 A). The presence of predicted shared fs-mutations in the last three tumor types suggests a broader occurrence of shared poly-epitope fs-peptides across tumors. Notably around 20%, 40%, and 60% of intestine, stomach, and endometrial cell lines expressed shared fs-peptides, respectively ( Figure 4 B). Initially predicted in TCGA cohorts, fs-mutations expressing shared fs-peptides were also significantly shared in cancer cell lines compared to other fs-mutations derived from the same genes ( Figure 4 C). Allele coverage analysis indicated that predicted shared fs-mutations were present at 30%–50% allele frequency on average in cancer lines ( Figure 4 D). RNA-seq indicates gene expression patterns are unchanged upon acquiring shared frameshifts ( Table S3 ), ruling out the possibility of epigenetic allele-specific silencing. Significantly, fs-epitopes derived from predicted shared mutations could be detected by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) proteomic analysis of peptides eluted from MHC class I of HCT116, an MSI-H colorectal cancer cell line ( Bassani-Sternberg et al., 2015 6. Bassani-Sternberg, M. ∙ Pletscher-Frankild, S. ∙ Jensen, L.J. ... Mass spectrometry of human leukocyte antigen class I peptidomes reveals strong effects of protein abundance and turnover on antigen presentation Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2015; 14 :658-673 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (329) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 4 E; Table S2 ), establishing fs-mutations yield epitopes that can be processed and presented for recognition by the immune system. Finally, we used targeted PCR coupled with Sanger sequencing to verify the presence of selected shared indel sequences in CCLE cell lines. Our analysis showed indel mutations could be recalled with high specificity and sensitivity, reaching an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.882 ( Figure 4 F; Data S1 ). Overall, the CCLE dataset analyses confirm the widespread occurrence of predicted shared fs-peptides in cancer cells as well as their presentability by MHC-I on the cell surface.
MSI-H tumors are characterized by a high tumor mutational load and responsiveness to anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)-based immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) immunotherapy ( Le et al., 2015 32. Le, D.T. ∙ Uram, J.N. ∙ Wang, H. ... PD-1 Blockade in Tumors with Mismatch-Repair Deficiency N. Engl. J. Med. 2015; 372 :2509-2520 Crossref Scopus (7346) PubMed Google Scholar ; Dudley et al., 2016 19. Dudley, J.C. ∙ Lin, M.T. ∙ Le, D.T. ... Microsatellite instability as a biomarker for PD-1 blockade Clin. Cancer Res. 2016; 22 :813-820 Crossref Scopus (673) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, not all patients respond to therapy, suggesting additional differences between patients may underlie the lack of successful immunotherapy. We hypothesized that differential levels of fs-mutations translating into greater numbers of immunogenic peptides may in part account for the outcome of the immunotherapy. We first performed Cox regression and survival analyses of MSI-H UCEC patients in TCGA stratified by shared fs-load as high (top 50%) and low (bottom 50%), and analyzed tumor stage and patient age in the same strata to determine if fs-mutation numbers correlate with survival. Patient age and tumor stage were evenly represented in both fs-neoantigen high and fs-neoantigen low MSI-H cohorts. We did not detect any significant benefit in patients’ survival based on shared fs-neoantigen load in any MSI-H tumor types ( Figure S6 ).
Next, we analyzed the distribution of 46 shared fs-mutations in cancer patients undergoing PD-1 blockade (12 MSI-H and 4 MSS patients, NCT01876511) ( Le et al., 2015 32. Le, D.T. ∙ Uram, J.N. ∙ Wang, H. ... PD-1 Blockade in Tumors with Mismatch-Repair Deficiency N. Engl. J. Med. 2015; 372 :2509-2520 Crossref Scopus (7346) PubMed Google Scholar , 2017 33.

Mandal, R. ∙ Samstein, R.M. ∙ Lee, K.W. ... Genetic diversity of tumors with mismatch repair deficiency influences anti-PD-1 immunotherapy response Science. 2019; 364 :485-491 Crossref Scopus (379) PubMed Google Scholar ). We confirmed the wide presence of shared mutations in tumor samples on a genomic level as well as high concordance with MS status ( Figures 5 A and 5B; Table S4 ). 70% of shared fs-mutations were present in >20% of the MSI-H patients in the immunotherapy cohort ( Figure 5 C). We also analyzed the distribution of neoantigens derived from shared fs-peptides. Fs-neoantigens were widely present in MSI-H patients, whereas undetected in MSS patients ( Figure 5 D). The shared fs-neoantigen load was higher in MSI-H patients responding to PD-1 immunotherapy ( Figure 5 E), emphasizing the potential importance of fs-neoantigens in driving response to ICI. Although many antigen-independent mechanisms might underlie the poor response rates in a subset of those patients, a potential combination of PD-1 and shared MSI-H vaccine may therefore hold promise in improving outcomes of immunotherapy for non-responsive MSI-H patients.
Our data has suggested that shared fs-mutations yield unique arrays of neoantigens that should be highly immunogenic. To assess the potential immunogenicity of the nine predicted fs-peptides identified from the MSI-H UCEC patient cohort ( Figure 2 D), we induced T cell responses against each neopeptide stretch using an immunogenicity assay designed to rapidly prime naive T cells ( Cimen Bozkus et al., 2019 12. Cimen Bozkus, C. ∙ Roudko, V. ∙ Finnigan, J.P. ... Immune Checkpoint Blockade Enhances Shared Neoantigen-Induced T-cell Immunity Directed against Mutated Calreticulin in Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Cancer Discov. 2019; 9 :1192-1207 Crossref Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar ). We first designed long overlapping peptide (OLP) libraries spanning each fs-peptide ( Table S2 ) to prime and expand T cells from 15 randomly picked healthy donors (HDs). After expansion, the cells were stimulated with OLP pools and fs-peptide-specific T cell responses were evaluated by measuring interferon (IFN)-γ production using ELISPOT ( Figure 6 A). Each fs-peptide was able to elicit T cell responses in a subset of subjects tested. Furthermore, some subjects had reactive T cells against multiple fs-peptides ( Figures 6 B–6D). Importantly, when combined, the fs-peptide-specific T cells were significantly enriched across the subject cohort ( Figure 6 D), in agreement with our prediction that the combination of fs-epitopes derived from all 9 peptides has the best representation of all possible pMHC interactions per population ( Figure 2 D). We confirmed the fs-peptide-specific T cell responses in the same HD cohort by intracellular staining (ICS). Responses to fs-peptides were observed primarily in CD8 + T cells, indicating strong priming to these neoantigens ( Figures 6 E–6G). In total, a majority of HDs responded to at least one fs-peptide: IFN-γ + reactive CD8 T cell population increased at least 2-fold compared to background in 11 patients out of 14 tested. Importantly, the reactive T cells produced tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), in addition to IFN-γ, suggesting fs-peptide-specific T cells are polyfunctional ( Figures 6 E and S7 ). Additionally, we synthesized control peptides (15-aa) for each fs-peptide using the wild-type (WT) sequence surrounding the fs-mutation site origin. Responses by HD T cells to stimulation with the WT OLP pool were not higher than the background ( Figure 6 H), suggesting that the observed T cell responses were specific to fs-peptides.
Next, we investigated whether the shared fs-peptides can give rise to multiple immunogenic epitopes as suggested by our computational predictions. We selected a donor, HD13, that displayed CD8 + T cell effector responses upon stimulation with multiple fs-peptide OLP pools, namely SLC35F5, SLC22A9_C, and RNF43 ( Figure 6 F) and deconvoluted each OLP pool by re-stimulating cells initially expanded with pooled peptides with the individual peptides constituting each pool ( Figure S7 ). The data indicate that fs-peptides encode multiple MHC-I-restricted epitopes ( Figure 6 I). We also investigated whether the fs-peptide-specific T cell responses that were observed in the HD cohort correlated with the predicted high affinity epitope load. Epitope load was assessed by first determining the class I alleles of each subject by sequence-based MHC-I genotyping and enumerating the number of predicted epitopes with high binding affinity from a given fs-peptide to each subject’s genotype. We found no significant correlation between the predicted epitope load per patient and the in vitro measured response rate ( Figure S7 ). This observation may suggest that it is not quantity but rather quality of the predicted antigens which is responsible for the T cell response rate ( Balachandran et al., 2017 4. Balachandran, V.P. ∙ Łuksza, M. ∙ Zhao, J.N. ..., Australian Pancreatic Cancer Genome Initiative, Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Prince of Wales Hospital, Royal North Shore Hospital, University of Glasgow, St Vincent’s Hospital, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, University of Melbourne, Centre for Cancer Research, University of Queensland, Institute for Molecular Bioscience, Bankstown Hospital, Liverpool Hospital, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Chris O’Brien Lifehouse, Westmead Hospital, Fremantle Hospital, St John of God Healthcare, Royal Adelaide Hospital, Flinders Medical Centre, Envoi Pathology, Princess Alexandria Hospital, Austin Hospital, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutes, ARC-Net Centre for Applied Research on Cancer Identification of unique neoantigen qualities in long-term survivors of pancreatic cancer Nature. 2017; 551 :512-516 Crossref Scopus (819) PubMed Google Scholar ; Łuksza et al., 2017 34.

A neoantigen fitness model predicts tumour response to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy Nature. 2017; 551 :517-520 Crossref Scopus (469) PubMed Google Scholar ). Further inspection of the predicted antigens may help to understand the intrinsic properties underlying their exceptional T cell recognition.
Finally, we investigated whether fs-peptide-specific T cell responses could be detected in MSI-H cancer patients. PBMCs from 3 patients, 2 with MSI-H UCEC, and 1 with MSI-H COAD ( Figure S7 ) were stimulated with fs-peptide OLP pools. Following T cell expansion in response to simulation with fs-peptides, we observed high frequencies of primarily fs-peptide-specific effector CD8 + T cell responses in all 3 MSI-H cancer patients that were monitored ( Figure 6 J). To assess whether in vivo priming has occurred in MSI-H patients, we performed ex vivo T cell stimulation assays using PBMCs from 2 MSI-H patients, COAD and UCEC, and monitored IFN-γ formation by ELISPOT after 48 h of stimulation with fs-peptide pools. Overall, we did not observe robust spontaneous responses against fs-peptides, except for SLC35F5 in patient 3 ( Figure S7 ). SLC35F5-specific responses were also observed in expanded cultures of T cells from patient 3 ( Figure 6 J). These findings suggest either a lack of robust preexisting fs-peptide-specific T cell immunity in MSI-H patients or technical limitations in the detection of responses in non-expanded cells due to a low frequency of fs-peptide-specific T cells. Altogether, our data show that MSI-H patients have an increased frequency of high-quality T cell epitopes derived from shared fs-peptides, binding to a broad spectrum of MHC alleles, which are capable of inducing CD8 + T cell responses.

Section: Discussion

In this study, we evaluated MSI-H patients from TCGA for the presence of shared, immunogenic tumor-associated neoantigens. Our approach to detect neoantigens relies on two assumptions: (1) indel mutations occurring in frequently mutated microsatellite regions lead to identical fs-peptide extensions, and (2) these frequent, identical fs-peptide extensions encode poly-epitopes with broad MHC-I specificity. We confirmed the validity of our neoantigen selection approach by testing the immunogenicity of selected fs-peptides and finding selected peptides were highly immunogenic and generated strong CD8 + T cell responses in both healthy donors and MSI-H patients. Indeed, the ease with which we could prime CD8 + T cells from HDs suggests that these epitopes are particularly immunogenic. This observation is exceptional, because studies have reported that the majority of predicted missense-derived neoantigens preferentially elicit CD4 + T cell responses, even when the vaccines were designed based on the predictions for MHC-I affinity ( Ott et al., 2017 42. Ott, P.A. ∙ Hu, Z. ∙ Keskin, D.B. ...

We found fs-peptide-specific T cells to primarily elicit CD8 + responses. This could be because the fs-peptides we tested were selected based on their predicted high-affinity binding to multiple MHC-I molecules. Alternatively, we characterized fs-peptide-specific T cell responses by priming HD T cells in vitro , where the dynamics of T cell priming and induction are likely to be significantly different than in the context of cancer, where immunosuppressive mechanisms are at play. Although in MSI-H patients fs-peptides again mainly induced CD8 + T cells, this observation is limited by sample size. Another limitation is that we have not directly evaluated the tumor cell killing capacity of fs-peptide-specific T cells due to the inaccessibility of autologous or MHC-I-matched tumor cell lines with confirmed expression of fs-mutations. Further studies will be required to fully determine any potential bias exhibited by T cell subsets against fs-peptides, the cytotoxicity of fs-peptide-specific T cells, and the prevalence of pre-existing memory T cells against fs-peptides in MSI-H cancer patients.
From a tumor evolution perspective, multiple tumor-intrinsic mechanisms to avoid immune responses against immunogenic fs-epitopes exist, including the upregulation of checkpoint molecules to evade the development of antitumor T cell responses ( Le et al., 2015 32.

The blockade of this mechanism has been proven to be effective in improving response rates in a range of MSI-H tumors in multiple clinical trials ( Le et al., 2015 32. Le, D.T. ∙ Uram, J.N. ∙ Wang, H. ... PD-1 Blockade in Tumors with Mismatch-Repair Deficiency N. Engl. J. Med. 2015; 372 :2509-2520 Crossref Scopus (7346) PubMed Google Scholar , 2017 33.

However, several other immune resistance mechanisms are described, including downregulation of MHC alleles and/or β-microglobulin expression, inactivation/loss of antigen processing and/or interferon-γ-response pathway genes, and disruption of immunogenic neoantigens by acquired mutations ( Gao et al., 2016 21. Gao, J. ∙ Shi, L.Z. ∙ Zhao, H. ...

Primary, Adaptive, and Acquired Resistance to Cancer Immunotherapy Cell. 2017; 168 :707-723 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (3424) PubMed Google Scholar ). We examined this latter possibility with respect to mutational escape of shared poly-epitope fs-peptides. In certain cases, we observed mutations that were potentially disruptive to the predicted neoantigens ( Figure S2 ).
Of note, shared fs-mutation load was not predictive for patients’ survival across all tested tumors ( Figure S6 ). Although shared fs-neoantigen load was marginally higher in responders to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy, the shared fs-neoantigens were present in the non-responsive group as well ( Figure 5 E). Many antigen-independent mechanisms might underlie the poor response rates in a subset of those patients and a potential combination of PD-1 blockade and a shared fs-neoantigen vaccine may therefore hold promise in improving outcomes of immunotherapy for non-responsive MSI-H patients. Another important observation is the high-occurrence of predicted shared fs-peptides in genomic samples of independently collected cohorts and datasets, including CPTAC, an immunotherapy cohort, and cancer cell lines ( Figures 3 , 4 , and 5 ). Finding shared fs-deletions in RNA-seq and fs-peptides in MS/MS samples suggests that fs-neoantigens are present both at transcriptional and protein levels. Similar to our discovery, a few published reports identified the same shared fs-deletions and characterized their potential biological role ( Giannakis et al., 2014 25. Giannakis, M. ∙ Hodis, E. ∙ Jasmine Mu, X. ... RNF43 is frequently mutated in colorectal and endometrial cancers Nat. Genet. 2014; 46 :1264-1266 Crossref Scopus (355) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tu et al., 2019 53. Tu, J. ∙ Park, S. ∙ Yu, W. ...

Rep. 2019; 9 :18557 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ). The retained expression of fs-derived neoepitopes may be due to the fact that their RNA can exhibit a high rate of turnover and processivity within cancer cells that is otherwise not deleterious. Indeed, mRNAs that encode frameshift mutations may be rapidly degraded through the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway, which is accompanied by nascent peptide decay on the 80S ribosome ( Frischmeyer et al., 2002 20. Frischmeyer, P.A. ∙ van Hoof, A. ∙ O’Donnell, K. ...

Quality and quantity control of gene expression by nonsense-mediated mRNA decay Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2019; 20 :406-420 Crossref Scopus (450) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although the expression of fs-genes may be downregulated at the RNA level, the translated product is destabilized and quickly processed by proteasome producing short, presentable peptides at a higher rate ( Buchwald et al., 2010 7. Buchwald, G. ∙ Ebert, J. ∙ Basquin, C. ... Insights into the recruitment of the NMD machinery from the crystal structure of a core EJC-UPF3b complex Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

USA. 2011; 108 :11572-11577 Crossref Scopus (127) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Finally, we investigated the qualities of fs-mutations. Because mutation-derived neoantigens are highly similar to self-peptides, previous reports used similarity to immunogenic viral epitopes or dissimilarity from self to assess whether a distribution of neoantigens is predictive of outcome to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy or long-term survival ( Balachandran et al., 2017 4. Balachandran, V.P. ∙ Łuksza, M. ∙ Zhao, J.N. ..., Australian Pancreatic Cancer Genome Initiative, Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Prince of Wales Hospital, Royal North Shore Hospital, University of Glasgow, St Vincent’s Hospital, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, University of Melbourne, Centre for Cancer Research, University of Queensland, Institute for Molecular Bioscience, Bankstown Hospital, Liverpool Hospital, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Chris O’Brien Lifehouse, Westmead Hospital, Fremantle Hospital, St John of God Healthcare, Royal Adelaide Hospital, Flinders Medical Centre, Envoi Pathology, Princess Alexandria Hospital, Austin Hospital, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutes, ARC-Net Centre for Applied Research on Cancer Identification of unique neoantigen qualities in long-term survivors of pancreatic cancer Nature. 2017; 551 :512-516 Crossref Scopus (819) PubMed Google Scholar ; Łuksza et al., 2017 34.

Biol. 2019; 2 :135 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ). To determine whether similar principles applied to fs-neoantigens, we investigated similarities between fs-neoantigens, viral epitopes, and missense neoantigens. We found missense-derived neoantigens to be 3 times more similar to viral epitopes than fs-neoantigens. We attributed this to host-virus co-evolution and viral mimicry of host function. The fs-mutations are therefore even “further from self” than viral antigens ( Figure S5 ). Taken together, we conclude that frameshifts represent a unique and intrinsically different sequence space of high-quality antigens with a great potential for discovering immunogenic epitopes that can be targeted by immune therapies.
A recent study investigated the presence and sequences of fs-derived neoepitopes in TCGA and arrived at similar conclusions ( Koster and Plasterk, 2019 30. Koster, J. ∙ Plasterk, R.H.A.

Rep. 2019; 9 :6577 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ), and a few previous reports have also investigated the immunogenicity of unique fs-mutations but on a significantly smaller scale ( Woerner et al., 2003 64.

Furthermore, the data presented here provides a set of preselected fs-mutations for developing targeted sequencing panels for diagnostic purposes. The usage of targeted sequencing panels for diagnostics have already proven essential for developing actionable treatments, particularly in the selection of targeted regimens. We believe the same paradigm will become useful for precision immunotherapies, with physicians being able to select the ideal individualized cancer vaccine formulations based on the results of targeted sequencing panels. Our work also revealed the possibility of designing common cancer vaccines in specific tumor subtypes with broad MHC-I specificity. By applying such tailored vaccines for MSI-H endometrial, colorectal, and stomach carcinomas, one can potentially achieve immunological responses against existing neoplasms or develop preventive memory T cell responses in high-risk patient populations, like those with Lynch syndrome.

Custom computer code and pipelines are either described in the Method Details section or available at GitHub: https://github.com/VladimirRoudko/shared_frameshift_neoantigen/ . Alternatively, the code is available upon request by the first author (V.R).
Human healthy donor PBMC samples were purchased from New York Blood Center ( https://nybloodcenter.org ). Human MSI-H cancer patients’ PBMCs were obtained under consent form linked to IRB-19-02392. Sex, gender and age of healthy donors’ samples is unavailable as it is an anonymous donation. Sex, gender and age of consented cancer patients are provided in Figure S7 . Conditions of in vitro studies conducted with primary PBMC cultures are specified in Method Details section. Conditions and maintenance of cancer cell lines ( Figure 4 ) are described in Data S1 .
Tumor-associated antigens were predicted using somatic mutation datasets, called by the internal mutation pipelines of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA 2018 version). Therefore, the results obtained in this paper are in part based on data generated by the TCGA Research Network: https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg/research/structural-genomics/tcga . Called somatic missense and frameshift mutations by Mutect, Somatic Sniper, Varscan and Muse were combined together (union) per each patient. For somatic missense mutations, corresponding 17-amino acid residue-length normal peptides, surrounding a mutation site, were converted to tumor-specific peptides and used for MHC-I epitope prediction. In the case of frameshift mutations, the tumor specific peptide was called as follows: the major mRNA isoform corresponding to the frameshift mutation, translated starting with the “-8” aminoacid residue position from the mutation site until the stop codon within the new open reading frame as defined by the frameshift mutation. Predicted frameshift peptides were used for MHC-I epitope prediction by NetMHC v4.0 ( Andreatta and Nielsen, 2016 2. Andreatta, M. ∙ Nielsen, M. Gapped sequence alignment using artificial neural networks: application to the MHC class I system Bioinformatics. 2016; 32 :511-517 Crossref Scopus (740) PubMed Google Scholar ; Nielsen and Andreatta, 2016 41. Nielsen, M. ∙ Andreatta, M. NetMHCpan-3.0; improved prediction of binding to MHC class I molecules integrating information from multiple receptor and peptide length datasets Genome Med. 2016; 8 :33 Crossref Scopus (372) PubMed Google Scholar ). A rank score threshold (< 2.0%) was used to filter the predicted binders. MHC allele types for > 5000 patients from TCGA were from a previously published paper ( Charoentong et al., 2017 10. Charoentong, P. ∙ Finotello, F. ∙ Angelova, M. ... Pan-cancer Immunogenomic Analyses Reveal Genotype-Immunophenotype Relationships and Predictors of Response to Checkpoint Blockade Cell Rep. 2017; 18 :248-262 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2843) PubMed Google Scholar ). Collected epitope data was analyzed using statistical packages Prism and R. To characterize mutation expression at the RNA level, hg19-aligned RNaseq bam files were downloaded from GDC ( https://gdc.cancer.gov ). Obtained .bam files were processed with samtools to extract RNaseq reads, covering 250 nt genomic loci around shared fs-mutation (samtools view -b -L {target.region.bed} {input.bam} > {output.bam}). To count indel events in extracted RNaseq bam files, we applied samtools mpileup (samtools mpileup -uf {reference.fasta} {input.bam} | bcftools view -l {target.region.bed} - | grep “INDEL” > {output.v cf. }. Finally, the obtained data was processed with custom scripts and analyzed in PRISM8. To recall mutations with orthogonal approaches we applied bamreadcount. Sequencing read coverages for genomic loci of 46 shared frameshift mutations were downloaded from GDC using standard curl request. Obtained sequencing files were analyzed with bamreadcount (bam-readcount -q 10 -b 10 -d 100000 -l {target.region.bed} -f {reference.fasta} {input.bam} | grep “chr” > {output.file}. Readcounts were processed using custom python scripts to extract read coverages and qualities of targeted mutation sites. To assess the probability of fs-peptides being correctly translated, we deconvoluted the conditional probability shown in Figure S2 F the following way: P ccFM | cFM = 1 - [ (P uPM | cFM + P dPM | cFM ) x 3/4 × 3/27 + (P dPM | cFM x 2/3 + P dFM | cFM x 1/3) x Σ k = 1 n C n k x (7/len FM ) k + (P uFM | cFM + P dFM | cFM ) x 2/3 ] x ½, where len FM – is the length of the frameshift.
The collection of viral MHC-I epitopes was downloaded from the IEDB database and preformatted for BLAST usage (makeblastdb -in iedb.fasta -parse_seqids -dbtype prot). Predicted frameshift and missense T cell epitopes from MSI-H patients were compared with IEDB epitopes using blastp (blastp -db {iedb.fasta} -query {input.frameshift.fasta} -outfmt “6 qseqid sseqid pident ppos positive mismatch gapopen length qlen slen qstart qend sstart send qseq sseq evalue bitscore” -word_size 3 -gapopen 32767 -gapextend 32767 -evalue 1 -max_hsps_per_subject 1 -matrix BLOSUM62 -max_target_seqs 10000000 -out {output.file}. To compare predicted epitopes with the human proteome, we used gap aware last-align. First, we preformatted the human proteome (December 2016 version, Ensembl) using lastdb -p human.proteome human.proteome.fasta. Then we used lastal to compare epitopes with this database (lastal -f MAF -r 2 -q 1 -m 100000000 -a 100000 -d 15 -l 4 -k 1 -j1 -P 10 human.proteome {input.frameshifts.fasta} > {output.fasta}. Finally, the obtained results were processed with custom scripts (bash, python) and analyzed in PRISM8.
CCLE: Somatic mutation data and normalized RNaseq expression values for genes with shared fs-mutations were obtained from https://portals.broadinstitute.org/ccle . CPTAC: Somatic mutation data and the MS-status of patients was obtained from published studies ( Vasaikar et al., 2019 56. Vasaikar, S. ∙ Huang, C. ∙ Wang, X. ..., Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium Proteogenomic Analysis of Human Colon Cancer Reveals New Therapeutic Opportunities Cell. 2019; 177 :1035-1049 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (451) PubMed Google Scholar ; Dou et al., 2020 18. Dou, Y. ∙ Kawaler, E.A. ∙ Cui Zhou, D. ..., Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium Proteogenomic Characterization of Endometrial Carcinoma Cell. 2020; 180 :729-748 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (271) PubMed Google Scholar ). Immunotherapy cohort: Somatic mutation data, MS-status and matching normal and tumor WES datasets were generously provided by T. Chan from published studies ( Le et al., 2015 32. Le, D.T. ∙ Uram, J.N. ∙ Wang, H. ... PD-1 Blockade in Tumors with Mismatch-Repair Deficiency N. Engl. J. Med. 2015; 372 :2509-2520 Crossref Scopus (7346) PubMed Google Scholar ; Mandal et al., 2019 36. Mandal, R. ∙ Samstein, R.M. ∙ Lee, K.W. ... Genetic diversity of tumors with mismatch repair deficiency influences anti-PD-1 immunotherapy response Science. 2019; 364 :485-491 Crossref Scopus (379) PubMed Google Scholar ). To match obtained WES datasets with patient clinical responses, we performed independent MHC-typing with Optitype ( Szolek et al., 2014 52. Szolek, A. ∙ Schubert, B. ∙ Mohr, C. ... OptiType: precision HLA typing from next-generation sequencing data Bioinformatics. 2014; 30 :3310-3316 Crossref Scopus (467) PubMed Google Scholar ) and compared it to originally published data. The data was statistically analyzed in PRISM8.
MS/MS datasets were downloaded from PRIDE ( https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/ ) or CPTAC endometrial and colon studies ( https://proteomics.cancer.gov/data-portal ). Retrieved data was analyzed using the standalone version of Pepquery v.1.4.1 ( Wen et al., 2019 61. Wen, B. ∙ Wang, X. ∙ Zhang, B. PepQuery enables fast, accurate, and convenient proteomic validation of novel genomic alterations Genome Res. 2019; 29 :485-493 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar , 2020 62. Wen, B. ∙ Li, K. ∙ Zhang, Y. ... Cancer neoantigen prioritization through sensitive and reliable proteogenomics analysis Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :1759 Crossref Scopus (81) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( http://www.pepquery.org ). Briefly, raw MS/MS spectra was converted to MGF format using msconvert ( http://proteowizard.sourceforge.net/tools.shtml ), which was then supplied to stand-alone Pepquery ( Wen et al., 2019 61. Wen, B. ∙ Wang, X. ∙ Zhang, B. PepQuery enables fast, accurate, and convenient proteomic validation of novel genomic alterations Genome Res. 2019; 29 :485-493 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the case of analysis of the HCT116 MHC-I MS/MS dataset ( Bassani-Sternberg et al., 2015 6. Bassani-Sternberg, M. ∙ Pletscher-Frankild, S. ∙ Jensen, L.J. ... Mass spectrometry of human leukocyte antigen class I peptidomes reveals strong effects of protein abundance and turnover on antigen presentation Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2015; 14 :658-673 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (329) PubMed Google Scholar ), predicted fs peptides were computationally sliced into overlapping 8-, 9-, 10- and 11-mer epitopes. The produced list of epitopes was submitted to pepquery analysis (pepquery -o “pep” -varMod 75,117 -e 0 -t 1 -tol 10 -tolu ppm -itol 0.05 -prefix “pep” -ms “${input.ms.file}” -pep “${input.frameshift.peptide}” -db “${reference.proteome}” -n 1000 -m 1 -maxLength 11 -minLength 8 -um -hc FALSE -cpu 30
To analyze whole cell MS/MS spectra of CPTAC datasets, pepquery command line was configured accordingly to reflect the MS/MS experimental settings (java -Xmx10G -jar pepquery-1.4.1.jar -o “pep” -fixMod 6 -varMod 117 -tol 10 -tolu ppm -itol 0.05 -prefix “pep” -t 1 -ms “${input.ms.file}” -i “${input.ms.file}” -db “${reference.proteome}” -n 1000 -m 1 -maxLength 50 -minLength 5 -um -hc FALSE -cpu 10 was applied for “VU” files, and java -Xmx10G -jar pepquery-1.4.1.jar -o “pep” -fixMod 6,62,108 -varMod 117 -tol 10 -tolu ppm -itol 0.05 -prefix “pep” -t 1 -ms “${input.ms.file}” -i “${input.ms.file}” -db “${reference.proteome}” -n 1000 -m 1 -maxLength 50 -minLength 5 -um -hc FALSE -cpu 10 for “PNNL” files). Obtained results are listed in Table S2 .
To validate CCLE-derived indel frequencies using an orthogonal experimental approach, we designed targeted high-fidelity PCR assay using a set of loci-specific primers ( Data S1 ). Obtained PCRs were purified and subjected to Sanger sequencing (Genscript). Obtained sequences were aligned to human reference genome using Clustal Omega multiple sequence alignment tool ( https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/ ). Finally, alignments were analyzed for the presence of indels in MS regions. Recalled CCLE indels ( Table S3 ) were used for ROC analysis ( http://www.rad.jhmi.edu/jeng/javarad/roc/JROCFITi.html ).
The use of patient-derived specimens was approved by the Institutional Review Boards at Mount Sinai Hospital (IRB-19-02392) and all patients provided written informed consent before the initiation of any study procedures. All patients analyzed in this study were diagnosed with cancer and demonstrated loss of expression of one or more MMR proteins by immunohistochemistry. Patient blood was collected by the clinical personnel and MNCs were isolated by density gradient centrifugation using Ficoll-Paque™ Plus (GE Healthcare). Only freshly isolated patient PBMCs were used in immunogenicity assays. Therefore, assays were performed once for each patient. Healthy donor specimens were procured from New York Blood Center as a leukopak and MNCs were isolated by density gradient centrifugation using Ficoll-Paque™ Plus (GE Healthcare). PBMCs were cryopreserved in human serum containing 10% DMSO. HD PBMCs were used after thawing.
Custom peptide libraries for WT and mutated peptides were chemically synthesized by GenScript (USA/China). Each peptide had > 85% purity as determined by high performance liquid chromatography. MOG and CEFT peptide pools were commercially available at JPT Peptide Technologies (Germany). Each peptide was resuspended in DMSO and used at a final concentration of 1 μg/mL. Sequences of mutated peptides are shown in Table S2 and the WT sequences are as follows: for SLC35F5 GKLTATQVAKISFFF, for SEC31A QAVQSQGFINYCQKK, for SLC22A9 LEILKSTMKKELEAA, for TTK ESHNSSSSKTFEKKR and YSGGESHNSSSSKTF, for SETD1B MENSHPPHHHHQQPP, for OR7E24 MSYFPILFFFFLKRC, for RNF43 KSSLSARHPQRKRRG and for ASTE1 AEIFLPKGRSNSKKK.
6x10 5 healthy donor PBMCs were cultured in X-VIVO15 media (LONZA) with cytokines promoting dendritic cell (DC) differentiation, GM-CSF (SANOFI, 1000 IU/mL), IL-4 (R&D Systems, 500 IU/mL) and Flt3L (R&D Systems, 50 ng/mL) overnight in U-bottom 96-well plates at 10 5 cells/well. After 24 hours, cells were stimulated with peptide pools (each peptide at 1 μg/mL) in the presence of adjuvants promoting DC maturation, LPS (Invivogen, 0.1 μg/mL), R848 (Invivogen, 10 μM) and IL-1β (R&D Systems 10 ng/mL), in X-VIVO15. Stimulation with DMSO (vehicle) and MOG pool (JPT, 1 μg/mL) were used as negative controls and CEFT pool (JPT, 1 μg/mL) were used as positive controls. Next day, cells were fed with IL-2 (R&D Systems, 10 IU/mL) and IL-7 (R&D Systems, 10 ng/mL) in RPMI media (GIBCO) containing 10% human serum. Cells were fed every 2-3 days. IL-2 and IL-7 were not added at the last feeding. After 10 days of culture, cells were harvested and re-stimulated with peptides (1 μg/mL) in the presence of anti-CD28 (BD Biosciences, 0.5 mg/mL) and anti-CD49d (BD Biosciences, 0.5 mg/mL) antibodies. Where indicated, cells were stimulated with PMA (Sigma-Aldrich, 50 ng/mL) and ionomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, 1 μg/mL), as positive control. IFN-γ formation was measured by flow cytometry or ELISPOT. For flow cytometry, 1 hour after re-stimulation with peptides, cells were added BD GolgiStop™, containing monensin and BD GolgiPlug™, containing brefeldin A according to manufacturer’s suggestion. IFN-γ production was measured 8-12-hours after the addition of protein transport inhibitors by intracellular staining using BD Cytofix/Cytoperm™ reagents according to manufacturer’s protocol. A combination of the following antibodies was used: for surface staining; CD3 (Clone: OKT3 or SK7, FITC), CD4 (Clone: RPA-T4, BV785 or PerCP-Cy5.5) and CD8a (Clone: RPA-T8, APC) and for intracellular staining IFN-γ (Clone: B27, PE), TNF-α (Clone: Mab11, PE/Cy7) and IL-2 (Clone: MQ1-17H12, PerCP-Cy5.5). All antibodies were purchased via BioLegend. LIVE/DEAD Fixable Blue Dead Cell Stain Kit by Thermo Fischer Scientific was used for live and dead cell discrimination. Data was acquired using the BD Fortessa or Canto and the data was analyzed on FlowJo V10 (TreeStar). For ELISPOT analysis, cells were stimulated in plates with mixed cellular ester membrane that were coated with anti-IFN-γ antibody (Mabtech, Clone 1-D1k, 4 μg/mL) and blocked by incubating with 10% human serum containing media at 37°C for at least 1 h prior to addition of cells. Cells were seeded in duplicates at either 5x10 4 or 10 5 per well for analysis of expanded cells and at 2.5x10 5 cell per well for ex vivo analysis and stimulated as detailed above. Plates were processed for IFN-γ detection after 48-hours of culture. Plates were first incubated with biotinylated anti-IFN-γ antibody (clone 7-B6-1 by Mabtech, used at 0.2 μg/mL) for 2 h at 37°C, then 1 h at room temperature with streptavidin-AP conjugate (Roche, used at 0.75 U/mL) and lastly with the SigmaFast BCIP/NBT substrate for 15 minutes at room temperature. Plates were washed 6x with PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 and 3x with water in between each step. Plates were scanned and analyzed by ImmunoSpot software.
Statistical analysis was performed using statistical tools available in PRISM8. Non-parametric Mann-Whitney two-tailed test was used to infer the statistical significance of indel allele expression in MSI-H cohorts ( Figure 3 ), and shared fs-peptide enrichment in the immunotherapy cohort and CCLE dataset ( Figures 4 and 5 ). Statistical significance of MS/MS identifications by Pepquery ( Figures 3 , 4 , and S4 ) was set to the default approach (see Method Details for details). Standard t test and Wilcoxon sign-ranked test were used to infer statistical significance for T cell responses ( Figure 6 ). In all performed tests, significance was defined by p value set to 0.05. Survival and hazard ratio analyses were performed using the survival package in R.
