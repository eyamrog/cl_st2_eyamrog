Title: Modulation of RNA Condensation by the DEAD-Box Protein eIF4A


Abstract: Summary

Stress granules are condensates of non-translating mRNAs and proteins involved in the stress response and neurodegenerative diseases. Stress granules form in part through intermolecular RNA-RNA interactions, and to better understand how RNA-based condensation occurs, we demonstrate that RNA is effectively recruited to the surfaces of RNA or RNP condensates in vitro . We demonstrate that, through ATP-dependent RNA binding, the DEAD-box protein eIF4A reduces RNA condensation in vitro and limits stress granule formation in cells. This defines a function for eIF4A to limit intermolecular RNA-RNA interactions in cells. These results establish an important role for eIF4A, and potentially other DEAD-box proteins, as ATP-dependent RNA chaperones that limit the condensation of RNA, analogous to the function of proteins like HSP70 in combatting protein aggregates.

Section: Introduction

Eukaryotic cells contain ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules in the nucleus and cytosol, including P-bodies (PBs) and stress granules (SGs) ( Anderson and Kedersha, 2006; Banani et al., 2017 2. Anderson, P. ∙ Kedersha, N. RNA granules J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172 :803-808 Crossref Scopus (911) PubMed Google Scholar 6. Banani, S.F. ∙ Lee, H.O. ∙ Hyman, A.A. ... Biomolecular condensates: organizers of cellular biochemistry Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2017; 18 :285-298 Crossref Scopus (3254) PubMed Google Scholar ). SGs are cytosolic condensates composed of non-translating RNPs that are involved in the stress response, neurodegeneration, and viral infection ( Protter and Parker, 2016; Ivanov et al., 2019 37. Ivanov, P. ∙ Kedersha, N. ∙ Anderson, P. Stress Granules and Processing Bodies in Translational Control Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2019; 11 :a032813 Crossref Scopus (283) PubMed Google Scholar 68. Protter, D.S.W. ∙ Parker, R. Principles and Properties of Stress Granules Trends Cell Biol. 2016; 26 :668-679 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1030) PubMed Google Scholar ). SGs typically form in response to translation shutoff induced by noxious stimuli such as arsenite, heat shock, and endogenous inflammatory molecules like prostaglandins, which all lead to phosphorylation of eIF2α and the activation of the integrated stress response ( Aulas et al., 2017; Tauber and Parker, 2019 4. Aulas, A. ∙ Fay, M.M. ∙ Lyons, S.M. ... Stress-specific differences in assembly and composition of stress granules and related foci J. Cell Sci. 2017; 130 :927-937 Crossref Scopus (181) PubMed Google Scholar 87. Tauber, D. ∙ Parker, R. 15-Deoxy-Δ 12,14 -prostaglandin J2 promotes phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α and activates the integrated stress response J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294 :6344-6352 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ). SGs can also form independently of eIF2α phosphorylation in response to inhibition of the eIF4F complex or osmotic stress ( Aulas et al., 2017 4. Aulas, A. ∙ Fay, M.M. ∙ Lyons, S.M. ... Stress-specific differences in assembly and composition of stress granules and related foci J. Cell Sci. 2017; 130 :927-937 Crossref Scopus (181) PubMed Google Scholar ). SGs and other RNP condensates are thought to form in part through multimeric RNA binding proteins crosslinking RNPs into larger networks ( Banani et al., 2017; Shin and Brangwynne, 2017 6. Banani, S.F. ∙ Lee, H.O. ∙ Hyman, A.A. ... Biomolecular condensates: organizers of cellular biochemistry Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2017; 18 :285-298 Crossref Scopus (3254) PubMed Google Scholar 82. Shin, Y. ∙ Brangwynne, C.P. Liquid phase condensation in cell physiology and disease Science. 2017; 357 :eaaf4382 Crossref Scopus (2168) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Recent evidence suggests that intermolecular RNA-RNA interactions are involved in SG formation. SGs require a substantial pool of non-translating RNA to form ( Protter and Parker, 2016 68. Protter, D.S.W. ∙ Parker, R. Principles and Properties of Stress Granules Trends Cell Biol. 2016; 26 :668-679 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1030) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, elevating the non-translating RNA concentration by injecting exogenous RNA induces SGs ( Mahadevan et al., 2013 59. Mahadevan, K. ∙ Zhang, H. ∙ Akef, A. ... RanBP2/Nup358 potentiates the translation of a subset of mRNAs encoding secretory proteins PLoS Biol. 2013; 11 :e1001545 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, certain RNAs can seed foci in human cell lysates that recruit many SG proteins ( Fay et al., 2017 22. Fay, M.M. ∙ Anderson, P.J. ∙ Ivanov, P. ALS/FTD-associated C9ORF72 repeat RNA promotes phase transitions in vitro and in cells Cell Rep. 2017; 21 :3573-3584 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (143) PubMed Google Scholar ). Strikingly, modest concentrations of yeast total RNA readily condense in physiological salt and polyamine conditions, recapitulating the SG transcriptome in a protein-free context ( Khong et al., 2017; Van Treeck et al., 2018 48. Khong, A. ∙ Matheny, T. ∙ Jain, S. ... The Stress Granule Transcriptome Reveals Principles of mRNA Accumulation in Stress Granules Mol. Cell. 2017; 68 :808-820.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (460) PubMed Google Scholar 92. Van Treeck, B. ∙ Protter, D.S.W. ∙ Matheny, T. ... RNA self-assembly contributes to stress granule formation and defining the stress granule transcriptome Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115 :2734-2739 Crossref Scopus (326) PubMed Google Scholar ), arguing that trans RNA-RNA interactions contribute to SG formation. Messenger RNPs (mRNPs) are recruited to SGs in a biphasic manner, first engaging in transient docking interactions with the SG surface, which then transition into stable locking interactions that leave the RNA immobile within the granule ( Moon et al., 2019 62. Moon, S.L. ∙ Morisaki, T. ∙ Khong, A. ... Multicolour single-molecule tracking of mRNA interactions with RNP granules Nat. Cell Biol. 2019; 21 :162-168 Crossref Scopus (136) PubMed Google Scholar ), implying that surface recruitment of RNAs to SGs is a precursor to a more stable RNP assembly.
Roles for RNA in forming, maintaining, and organizing RNP condensates are not limited to SGs. For example, nuclear paraspeckles require the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) NEAT1 to form ( Fox and Lamond, 2010 27. Fox, A.H. ∙ Lamond, A.I. Paraspeckles Cold Spring Harbor Perspect Biol. 2010; 2 :a000687 Crossref Scopus (250) PubMed Google Scholar ; West et al., 2016 93. West, J.A. ∙ Mito, M. ∙ Kurosaka, S. ... Structural, super-resolution microscopy analysis of paraspeckle nuclear body organization J. Cell Biol. 2016; 214 :817-830 Crossref Scopus (229) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, specific RNA-RNA interactions between NEAT1 domains may be important for paraspeckle formation and integrity ( Lu et al., 2016 58. Lu, Z. ∙ Zhang, Q.C. ∙ Lee, B. ... RNA Duplex Map in Living Cells Reveals Higher-Order Transcriptome Structure Cell. 2016; 165 :1267-1279 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (434) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lin et al., 2018 51. Lin, Y. ∙ Schmidt, B.F. ∙ Bruchez, M.P. ... Structural analyses of NEAT1 lncRNAs suggest long-range RNA interactions that may contribute to paraspeckle architecture Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46 :3742-3752 Crossref Scopus (111) PubMed Google Scholar ). Similarly, the formation of RNA foci of repeat expansion RNAs has been suggested to occur through an RNA-driven condensation ( Jain and Vale, 2017 38. Jain, A. ∙ Vale, R.D. RNA phase transitions in repeat expansion disorders Nature. 2017; 546 :243-247 Crossref Scopus (556) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the Drosophila embryo, homotypic intermolecular base pairing between oskar or bicoid mRNAs determines whether the RNAs will localize to RNP granules in the anterior or the posterior of the embryo, promoting polarity establishment ( Ferrandon et al., 1997; Jambor et al., 2011 24. Ferrandon, D. ∙ Koch, I. ∙ Westhof, E. ... RNA-RNA interaction is required for the formation of specific bicoid mRNA 3′ UTR-STAUFEN ribonucleoprotein particles EMBO J. 1997; 16 :1751-1758 Crossref Scopus (189) PubMed Google Scholar 40. Jambor, H. ∙ Brunel, C. ∙ Ephrussi, A. Dimerization of oskar 3′ UTRs promotes hitchhiking for RNA localization in the Drosophila oocyte RNA. 2011; 17 :2049-2057 Crossref Scopus (66) PubMed Google Scholar ). Specific trans interactions between mRNAs may also be important for their recruitment to polarized RNP granules in Ashbya gossypii ( Langdon et al., 2018 50. Langdon, E.M. ∙ Qiu, Y. ∙ Ghanbari Niaki, A. ... mRNA structure determines specificity of a polyQ-driven phase separation Science. 2018; 360 :922-927 Crossref Scopus (350) PubMed Google Scholar ). Despite their relevance to RNP condensate formation in cells, the properties of condensed RNA are not well understood.
The diversity of intermolecular RNA-RNA interactions relevant to RNP granules and the low barriers for RNA condensation in vitro ( Van Treeck and Parker, 2018 91. Van Treeck, B. ∙ Parker, R. Emerging Roles for Intermolecular RNA-RNA Interactions in RNP Assemblies Cell. 2018; 174 :791-802 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (259) PubMed Google Scholar ) are consistent with RNA-based assemblies playing multiple cellular roles but also create a need for the cell to regulate the processes of RNA condensation and recruitment. One possible modulatory mechanism would be the activity of RNA helicases—ATPases that can unwind RNA-RNA interactions and could thereby limit RNA condensation in the cell ( Jarmoskaite and Russell, 2014 41. Jarmoskaite, I. ∙ Russell, R. RNA helicase proteins as chaperones and remodelers Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2014; 83 :697-725 Crossref Scopus (186) PubMed Google Scholar ). A major class of RNA helicases are members of the “DExD/H-box” family that typically show highly cooperative binding to ATP and RNA but display low affinities for RNA when complexed with ADP, effectively making them ATP-dependent RNA binding proteins ( Andreou and Klostermeier, 2013 3. Andreou, A.Z. ∙ Klostermeier, D. The DEAD-box helicase eIF4A: paradigm or the odd one out? RNA Biol. 2013; 10 :19-32 Crossref Scopus (100) PubMed Google Scholar ; Putnam and Jankowsky, 2013 69. Putnam, A.A. ∙ Jankowsky, E. DEAD-box helicases as integrators of RNA, nucleotide and protein binding Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2013; 1829 :884-893 Crossref Scopus (147) PubMed Google Scholar ). Modulation of their ATPase activity can therefore control the rearrangement of RNPs ( Hodge et al., 2011 32. Hodge, C.A. ∙ Tran, E.J. ∙ Noble, K.N. ...

DEAD-box helicases as integrators of RNA, nucleotide and protein binding Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2013; 1829 :884-893 Crossref Scopus (147) PubMed Google Scholar ). DEAD-box proteins typically disrupt structures in RNAs in part through ATP-dependent RNA binding, with ATP hydrolysis acting as a switch to release the protein from the RNA ( Putnam and Jankowsky, 2013 69. Putnam, A.A. ∙ Jankowsky, E. DEAD-box helicases as integrators of RNA, nucleotide and protein binding Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2013; 1829 :884-893 Crossref Scopus (147) PubMed Google Scholar ). Virtually all RNP granules contain DEAD-box proteins ( Charroux et al., 1999; Saitoh et al., 2004; Dias et al., 2010; Hubstenberger et al., 2013; Calo et al., 2015; Tu and Barrientos, 2015; Jain et al., 2016; Hubstenberger et al., 2017; Markmiller et al., 2018; Youn et al., 2018 14.

Looking back on the birth of DEAD-box RNA helicases Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2013; 1829 :750-755 Crossref Scopus (84) PubMed Google Scholar ). For example, SGs contain multiple conserved helicases, including eIF4A/Tif1 and DDX3/Ded1, in both mammals and yeast, respectively ( Jain et al., 2016 39. Jain, S. ∙ Wheeler, J.R. ∙ Walters, R.W. ... ATPase-modulated stress granules contain a diverse proteome and substructure Cell. 2016; 164 :487-498 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1024) PubMed Google Scholar ). Similarly, DEAD-box proteins localize to bacterial RNP granules as well ( Al-Husini et al., 2018; Hondele et al., 2019 1.

DEAD-box ATPases are global regulators of phase-separated organelles Nature. 2019; 573 :144-148 Crossref Scopus (247) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Herein, we examine RNA condensation in vitro and SG formation in cells and how those processes are modulated by the essential translation initiation factor, SG component, and archetypal DEAD-box protein eIF4A. We show that RNA and RNP condensates stably interact with other RNAs or RNA-based condensates at their surfaces, promoting RNA condensate assembly. In contrast, we demonstrate that eIF4A limits the recruitment of RNAs to SGs, combating this process. Moreover, we show that the ATP-dependent binding of eIF4A to RNA, separate from its role in translation, can prevent the formation of SGs in cells, limit the interactions of PBs and SGs, and reduce the condensation of RNA in physiological conditions in vitro . Consistent with the mechanism of RNA unwinding by DEAD-box proteins, we show that RNA binding of eIF4A can be sufficient to limit RNA condensation or SG formation but that ATP hydrolysis may increase the effectiveness of eIF4A in limiting RNA condensation by allowing multiple cycles of RNA binding. Together, these data show that eIF4A functions as an ATP-dependent RNA binding protein to limit inappropriate intermolecular RNA-RNA interactions. Such an ATP-dependent RNA chaperone function is analogous to the role of protein chaperones like HSP70 in limiting inappropriate intermolecular protein-protein interactions.

Section: Results

To examine the nature of RNA condensation and how that process might affect RNP granule formation, we examined model RNA condensate systems in vitro with synthetic or purified RNAs. A wide variety of RNAs form RNA condensates in vitro , including all four homopolymers ( Langdon et al., 2018; Van Treeck et al., 2018; Jain and Vale, 2017; Aumiller et al., 2016 5.

Jain, A. ∙ Vale, R.D. RNA phase transitions in repeat expansion disorders Nature. 2017; 546 :243-247 Crossref Scopus (556) PubMed Google Scholar 50. Langdon, E.M. ∙ Qiu, Y. ∙ Ghanbari Niaki, A. ... mRNA structure determines specificity of a polyQ-driven phase separation Science. 2018; 360 :922-927 Crossref Scopus (350) PubMed Google Scholar 92. Van Treeck, B. ∙ Protter, D.S.W. ∙ Matheny, T. ... RNA self-assembly contributes to stress granule formation and defining the stress granule transcriptome Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115 :2734-2739 Crossref Scopus (326) PubMed Google Scholar ), demonstrating that RNA condensation can occur through non-Watson-Crick interactions. We examined the co-assembly of pairwise combinations of the homopolymer RNAs polyU, polyC, or polyA, which individually condense into RNA droplets of increasing viscosity ( Van Treeck et al., 2018 92. Van Treeck, B. ∙ Protter, D.S.W. ∙ Matheny, T. ... RNA self-assembly contributes to stress granule formation and defining the stress granule transcriptome Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115 :2734-2739 Crossref Scopus (326) PubMed Google Scholar ). The differential recruitment of short fluorescent RNA oligos into homopolymer assemblies ( Figures S1 A and S1B) allowed us to distinguish between homopolymer condensates. The robustness of oligo recruitment coincided with the relative strengths of the RNA-RNA interactions between the oligos and the homopolymer scaffolds, with the most efficient recruitment occurring when the oligo could form Watson-Crick base pairs with the condensate scaffold. Some non-complementary RNAs were robustly recruited to condensate surfaces instead, such as oligoG with polyA or PTR with polyC ( Figures S1 A and S1B). These RNAs have some capacity for homotypic trans interactions; for example, oligoG could in principle form intermolecular G-quadruplexes, suggesting that surface recruitment may occur when trans RNA-RNA interactions between the client RNAs on the surface are preferred over interactions with the homopolymer scaffold or solvent.
Examination of the condensation of mixed homopolymers revealed that increasing the net RNA-RNA interaction strength through extensive base pairing between polyA and polyU leads to gelatinous aggregates containing both homopolymers ( Figure 1 A). In contrast, mixtures of polyC and polyU spontaneously self-organize into patterned networks of alternating, immiscible polyC and polyU droplets ( Figure 1 A). A similar, but less organized, flocculation of polyA and polyC assemblies occurred ( Figure 1 A). These observations demonstrate that RNA-RNA interaction strengths determine the material phase of RNA condensates and that differential interaction strengths can lead to the homotypic clustering and specific compartmentalization of RNAs. Such sequence-specific organization of condensed RNAs may be relevant to the homotypic clustering and/or organization of RNAs in RNP condensates in cells, such as the Drosophila germ granule ( Trcek et al., 2015 89. Trcek, T. ∙ Grosch, M. ∙ York, A. ... Drosophila germ granules are structured and contain homotypic mRNA clusters Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 :7962 Crossref Scopus (125) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Multiple observations indicate that RNA condensates associate with one another at interfaces to minimize the total Gibbs free energy of their surfaces, which is the energetic cost of forming an interface between two phases (equivalent to the integral of the interfacial tensions with respect to area; Rowlinson and Widom, 1982 74. Rowlinson, J.S. ∙ Widom, B. Molecular Theory of Capillarity Oxford University Press, New York, 1982 Google Scholar ). First, the polyC/polyU interface is elongated, deforming the droplets from the typically favorable spherical shape and forming regions with all three phases in contact ( Figure 1 A). This implies that the polyC/polyU interaction reduces the total Gibbs surface free energy of each individual droplet pair and the whole system in comparison to an equivalent system of dispersed droplets lacking the interfacial interactions ( Rowlinson and Widom, 1982 74. Rowlinson, J.S. ∙ Widom, B. Molecular Theory of Capillarity Oxford University Press, New York, 1982 Google Scholar ). The similar docking of polyA and polyC condensates ( Figure 1 A) is also consistent with interfacial interactions reducing the total surface free energy. In addition, time-lapse microscopy shows that polyC and polyU condensates are associated from an early time point and appear to nucleate off of each other ( Video S1 ), indicating that their interfacial association is not merely due to droplet crowding. Finally, polyC and polyU droplets remain associated with each other following mechanical disruption ( Figure S1 C), indicating a physical interaction between the two condensate types.

Time-Lapse Microscopy Reveals the Growth of PolyC/PolyU RNA Condensate Networks, Related to Figure 1 Maximum intensity projections of deconvoluted 2 μm Z stacks of polyC (green) and polyU (red) condensates, labeled by fluorescent antisense RNA oligonucleotides, over time. Each frame represents 3 min of real time, with the first frame occurring 3 min following mixing with condensation buffer. Note that heterotypic droplets are associated at early time points, and that this association scaffolds the growth of the network.
The interactions of heterotypic RNA condensates suggested that the recruitment of RNAs to RNA/RNP condensate surfaces would also occur. To test this possibility, we condensed polyA, polyC, or polyU in the presence of fluorescently labeled mRNAs. We observed that most mRNAs localized to the surfaces of all three homopolymer condensates, though some RNAs were internalized in polyC condensates ( Figures 1 B and S1 D). Similarly, we observed that SGs isolated from mammalian cells ( Figures 1 C and 1D), and RNA assemblies formed from a myotonic dystrophy associated CUG repeat RNA (known to form RNA condensates in cells; Jain and Vale, 2017 38. Jain, A. ∙ Vale, R.D. RNA phase transitions in repeat expansion disorders Nature. 2017; 546 :243-247 Crossref Scopus (556) PubMed Google Scholar ), recruit RNA to their surfaces in vitro ( Figure 1 E). Thus, a diversity of RNA and RNP assemblies recruit RNAs to their surfaces.
We also observed that the condensation of pgc RNA with both polyC and polyU led to the formation of polyC/polyU multi-phase assemblies ( Figure 1 F), with pgc RNA localized robustly to the polyC/polyU interface. This observation argues that specific RNAs might act similarly to surfactants or interfacial shells between distinct RNA/RNP condensate phases and thereby stabilize multiphase RNP condensates like the nucleolus ( Feric et al., 2016 23. Feric, M. ∙ Vaidya, N. ∙ Harmon, T.S. ... Coexisting liquid phases underlie nucleolar subcompartments Cell. 2016; 165 :1686-1697 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1213) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Three observations demonstrate that the recruitment of RNAs to the surface of an RNA condensate leads to enhanced interaction between those RNAs and the formation of an RNA shell of enhanced stability enveloping the underlying RNA condensate. First, the surface ring of pgc mRNAs recruited to polyA condensates is more stable following dilution than the underlying polyA assembly, persisting for several minutes longer ( Figures 2 A and 2B; Video S2 ). Second, while the internal polyA droplet (visualized by fluorescent oligoU) is somewhat dynamic by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) analysis (mobile fraction [m.f.] at 15 min recovery, = 0.29 ± 0.02), the pgc shell shows virtually no recovery (m.f. = 0.02 ± 0.02), implying that the shell is immobile, which we confirmed by photobleaching only half the condensate and observing no pgc diffusion ( Figure S2 ). Third, using 4′-aminomethyltrioxsalen, which crosslinks RNA duplexes in UV light ( Frederiksen and Hearst, 1979 28. Frederiksen, S. ∙ Hearst, J.E.

These observations argue that the surfaces of RNA assemblies recruit RNAs. Moreover, the binding of RNAs onto the surface of an RNP granule can concentrate RNAs/RNPs, thereby promoting additional intermolecular RNA interactions, further stabilizing the condensate. This raises the possibility that recruitment of RNAs to the surfaces of RNP granules in cells will be a robust process, and therefore, mechanisms must exist to limit the recruitment of RNAs onto the surfaces of RNP granules. We hypothesized that one or more DEAD-box proteins would act as ATP-dependent RNA chaperones in cells by limiting or dissociating the trans RNA-RNA interactions that promote RNP condensation.
To examine the role of DEAD-box proteins functioning as RNA chaperones in limiting RNA condensation, we focused on SGs. Multiple DEAD-box proteins partition into SGs ( Chalupníková et al., 2008; Hilliker et al., 2011; Jain et al., 2016; Markmiller et al., 2018 16. Chalupníková, K. ∙ Lattmann, S. ∙ Selak, N. ...

We hypothesized that eIF4A1 would have additional functions since eIF4A1 is present at ∼10x the concentration of other eIF4F components ( Itzhak et al., 2016; Beck et al., 2011; Pause et al., 1994 7.

Dominant negative mutants of mammalian translation initiation factor eIF-4A define a critical role for eIF-4F in cap-dependent and cap-independent initiation of translation EMBO J. 1994; 13 :1205-1215 Crossref Scopus (337) PubMed Google Scholar ), with between 5 and 50 molecules of eIF4A1 per mRNA in U2OS and HeLa cells (see STAR Methods ).
eIF4A1 partitions into SGs during arsenite stress and on average extends further into the cytosol than the canonical SG marker G3BP1 ( Figure 3 B), indicating eIF4A1 is enriched at the periphery of SGs. In contrast, DDX1, another SG RNA helicase, is uniformly distributed within the granule and overlaps with G3BP1 ( Figure 3 B). The peripheral concentration of eIF4A1 in SGs is consistent with eIF4A1 modulating the interactions of RNAs with the surfaces of SGs.
If eIF4A limits the condensation of RNAs into SGs, then eIF4A inhibition should increase RNA partitioning into SGs. To separate the effects of eIF4A inhibition on translation initiation from its helicase function, we first treated U2OS cells with arsenite to inhibit bulk translation initiation through eIF2α phosphorylation then added hippuristanol (Hipp) for 30 min, which specifically inhibits the helicase activity of eIF4A by preventing ATP-dependent RNA binding ( Bordeleau et al., 2006a; Lindqvist et al., 2008 9. Bordeleau, M.E. ∙ Mori, A. ∙ Oberer, M. ... Functional characterization of IRESes by an inhibitor of the RNA helicase eIF4A Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2 :213-220 Crossref Scopus (301) PubMed Google Scholar 53. Lindqvist, L. ∙ Oberer, M. ∙ Reibarkh, M. ... Selective pharmacological targeting of a DEAD box RNA helicase PLoS ONE. 2008; 3 :e1583 Crossref Scopus (110) PubMed Google Scholar ). We then examined the partitioning of mRNAs into SGs by single molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH).
We observed that the fraction of TFRC , but not POLR2A , mRNAs associated with SGs increased after Hipp treatment ( Figure 3 C). We also observed that bulk mRNAs (assessed by oligo(dT) FISH) and DYNH1C1 , AHNAK , and PEG3 mRNAs, but not the MCM2 mRNA, partition more strongly into SG in the presence of arsenite and Hipp as compared to arsenite alone ( Figure S3 B). Since there are additional helicases in SGs, we also examined mRNA partitioning into arsenite-induced SGs following ATP depletion, which would inhibit all ATP-dependent RNA helicases. After ATP depletion, we observed both TFRC and POLR2A mRNAs increased their partitioning into SGs, consistent with other ATP-dependent mechanisms, including additional RNA helicases, limiting mRNA condensation into SGs ( Figure 3 C). We note the caveat that ATP depletion affects many cellular processes; hence, there may be indirect effects from ATP depletion. However, given the effects of other DEAD-box proteins on RNP granules (see below), it is highly probable that the increase in RNA partitioning we observe is due in part to inhibition of other ATP-dependent RNA chaperones.
To examine the role of eIF4A helicase activity on RNA partitioning into SGs independently of its role in translation in a second context, we also measured the partitioning of the SG-enriched NORAD lncRNA ( Khong et al., 2017 48. Khong, A. ∙ Matheny, T. ∙ Jain, S. ... The Stress Granule Transcriptome Reveals Principles of mRNA Accumulation in Stress Granules Mol. Cell. 2017; 68 :808-820.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (460) PubMed Google Scholar ), which is not thought to be translated, in the presence of arsenite, Hipp, or pateamine A (PatA), which inhibits eIF4A’s function in translation while stimulating eIF4A RNA binding and helicase activity ( Bordeleau et al., 2005; 2006b 8. Bordeleau, M.E. ∙ Matthews, J. ∙ Wojnar, J.M. ... Stimulation of mammalian translation initiation factor eIF4A activity by a small molecule inhibitor of eukaryotic translation Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102 :10460-10465 Crossref Scopus (190) PubMed Google Scholar 10. Bordeleau, M.E. ∙ Cencic, R. ∙ Lindqvist, L. ... RNA-mediated sequestration of the RNA helicase eIF4A by Pateamine A inhibits translation initiation Chem. Biol. 2006; 13 :1287-1295 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (131) PubMed Google Scholar ). We observed that NORAD RNA increased partitioning to SGs during Hipp treatment, as compared to arsenite or PatA ( Figure 3 D). Similarly, we observed that bulk mRNA and the abundant RNA binding protein G3BP1 partitioned more robustly to SGs in Hipp-treated cells as assessed by oligo(dT) FISH or immunofluorescence (IF), respectively, while average SG sizes where slightly decreased with Hipp or PatA ( Figures S3 B and S3C). This suggests that the density of SGs is increased.
These observations demonstrate that the RNA helicase activity of eIF4A1, independent of its role in translation, limits the accumulation of RNPs in SGs. We suggest that RNAs not affected by eIF4A, such as POLR2A or MCM2 , might be limited from entering SGs by other RNA chaperones or might be primarily targeted to SGs by proteins. For example, DEAD-box proteins can preferentially bind, target, and/or unwind differently structured RNAs in vitro and in vivo ( Murat et al., 2018; Ribeiro de Almeida et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2018 18. Chen, M.C. ∙ Tippana, R. ∙ Demeshkina, N.A. ... Structural basis of G-quadruplex unfolding by the DEAH/RHA helicase DHX36 Nature. 2018; 558 :465-469 Crossref Scopus (208) PubMed Google Scholar 64. Murat, P. ∙ Marsico, G. ∙ Herdy, B. ... RNA G-quadruplexes at upstream open reading frames cause DHX36- and DHX9-dependent translation of human mRNAs Genome Biol. 2018; 19 :229 Crossref Scopus (96) PubMed Google Scholar 71. Ribeiro de Almeida, C. ∙ Dhir, S. ∙ Dhir, A. ... RNA Helicase DDX1 Converts RNA G-Quadruplex Structures into R-Loops to Promote IgH Class Switch Recombination Mol. Cell. 2018; 70 :650-662.e8 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (126) PubMed Google Scholar ), and these preferences could extend to the ability of DEAD-box proteins to limit the condensation of specific RNAs.
We hypothesized that limiting intermolecular RNA interactions through eIF4A would affect not only the recruitment of mRNPs to SGs but also trans RNA-RNA interactions between mRNPs that contribute to SG assembly. To test this possibility, we took advantage of the observation that during arsenite stress, SGs do not form in cells lacking the abundant RNA binding proteins G3BP1/G3BP2, which provide protein-protein interactions to assist SG assembly through G3BP dimerization ( Tourrière et al., 2003; Kedersha et al., 2016 46. Kedersha, N. ∙ Panas, M.D. ∙ Achorn, C.A. ... G3BP-Caprin1-USP10 complexes mediate stress granule condensation and associate with 40S subunits J. Cell Biol. 2016; 212 :845-860 Crossref Scopus (395) PubMed Google Scholar 88. Tourrière, H. ∙ Chebli, K. ∙ Zekri, L. ... The RasGAP-associated endoribonuclease G3BP assembles stress granules J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160 :823-831 Crossref Scopus (719) PubMed Google Scholar ). We hypothesized that inhibition of eIF4A would compensate for the absence of G3BP in SG formation by promoting increased levels of intermolecular RNA-RNA interactions. Thus, we examined SG formation in wild-type (WT) and ΔΔG3BP1/2 cell lines during arsenite stress, where we altered eIF4A function after 30 min of arsenite stress with either Hipp, blocking RNA and ATP binding by eIF4A, or PatA as a negative control. Puromycin labeling revealed that translation was repressed similarly in all three conditions, indicating that any effects are not due to additional translational repression ( Figure S4 A).
Importantly, Hipp treatment partially restored SG formation in the ΔΔG3BP1/2 cell lines as assessed by PABPC1 IF, but PatA treatment did not ( Figures 4 A and 4B). These PABPC1 foci are SGs since they are sensitive to cycloheximide ( Figure S5 A), which blocks SG formation by trapping mRNAs in polysomes ( Kedersha et al., 2000 44. Kedersha, N. ∙ Cho, M.R. ∙ Lei, W. ... Dynamic shuttling of Tia-1 accompanies the recruitment of mRNA to stress granules J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151 :1257-1268 Crossref Scopus (635) PubMed Google Scholar ); they do not colocalize with PBs; and they contain multiple SG proteins, polyadenylated RNA, and the SG-enriched RNAs AHNAK and NORAD ( Figure S5 B). Small interfering RNA (siRNA) depletion of eIF4A1 ( Figure S4 B), the predominant form of eIF4A in U2OS cells ( Figure 3 A), also led to the restoration of SGs in the ΔΔG3BP1/2 cell line during arsenite treatment ( Figures 4 B and 4C). This demonstrates that eIF4A limits SG formation separately from promoting translation.
In principle, eIF4A could limit SG formation by limiting intermolecular RNA-RNA interactions or by increasing the off-rate of RNA binding proteins contributing to SG assembly. However, inhibition of eIF4A helicase activity with Hipp does not alter the exchange rates of G3BP1 ( Figure S4 H), consistent with eIF4A altering SG formation by promoting the dissociation of trans RNA-RNA interactions.
Since SGs were only partially restored with Hipp, we also depleted cells of ATP after 30 min of arsenite stress, when ATP is no longer necessary to release mRNAs from polysomes ( Jain et al., 2016; Khong and Parker, 2018 39. Jain, S. ∙ Wheeler, J.R. ∙ Walters, R.W. ... ATPase-modulated stress granules contain a diverse proteome and substructure Cell. 2016; 164 :487-498 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1024) PubMed Google Scholar 47. Khong, A. ∙ Parker, R. mRNP architecture in translating and stress conditions reveals an ordered pathway of mRNP compaction J. Cell Biol. 2018; 217 :4124-4140 Crossref Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar ), to inhibit all ATP-dependent DEAD-box proteins. Depletion of ATP restored SG formation more robustly than Hipp in ΔΔG3BP1/2 cells ( Figure 4 A). We interpret these observations to signify that in addition to eIF4A, other ATP-dependent mechanisms limit SG formation, although we cannot rule out indirect effects of ATP depletion on cell physiology that also lead to enhanced SG formation. The observation that ATP depletion following translational arrest promotes SG formation is consistent with RNP condensation into SGs being an energetically favored process.
Since inhibiting eIF4A increased SG formation independent of its role in translation, we predicted that overexpression of eIF4A would limit intermolecular RNA-RNA interactions and thereby limit SG formation. To test this, we overexpressed Myc-tagged eIF4A1 in WT U2OS cells by transient transfection ( Figure S4 C). We then examined whether cells with overexpressed eIF4A1 could still form SGs in response to arsenite treatment. We observed that cells with overexpression of eIF4A1 demonstrated defects in SG formation, although those cells still robustly repressed translation ( Figures 4 E–4G and S4 D), consistent with eIF4A1 limiting RNA condensation into SGs.
In principle, eIF4A could limit RNA condensation in two related manners. First, when bound to ATP, it could bind RNA and thereby compete with RNA-RNA interactions. Alternatively, it could utilize the energy of ATP hydrolysis to limit RNA condensation. Since eIF4A is known to promote RNA duplex unwinding by binding RNA in an ATP-dependent manner ( Rogers et al., 1999, 2001 72. Rogers, Jr., G.W. ∙ Richter, N.J. ∙ Merrick, W.C. Biochemical and kinetic characterization of the RNA helicase activity of eukaryotic initiation factor 4A J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274 :12236-12244 Crossref Scopus (261) PubMed Google Scholar 73. Rogers, Jr., G.W. ∙ Lima, W.F. ∙ Merrick, W.C. Further characterization of the helicase activity of eIF4A. Substrate specificity J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276 :12598-12608 Crossref Scopus (118) PubMed Google Scholar ), these are related mechanisms. To determine the mechanism by which eIF4A limits RNP condensation, we examined how mutations that inhibit either RNA binding or ATP hydrolysis affected the ability of eIF4A to limit SG formation when overexpressed in U2OS cells.
We observed that overexpression of an RNA binding mutant of eIF4A (R362Q; Pause et al., 1994 67. Pause, A. ∙ Méthot, N. ∙ Svitkin, Y. ... Dominant negative mutants of mammalian translation initiation factor eIF-4A define a critical role for eIF-4F in cap-dependent and cap-independent initiation of translation EMBO J. 1994; 13 :1205-1215 Crossref Scopus (337) PubMed Google Scholar ) did not prevent SG formation ( Figures 4 E and 4F). This indicates that RNA binding by eIF4A is required to inhibit SG formation. In contrast, we observed that overexpression of an ATPase inactive mutant (E183Q) that can still bind ATP and RNA ( Pause et al., 1994; Svitkin et al., 2001; Oguro et al., 2003 66. Oguro, A. ∙ Ohtsu, T. ∙ Svitkin, Y.V. ... RNA aptamers to initiation factor 4A helicase hinder cap-dependent translation by blocking ATP hydrolysis RNA. 2003; 9 :394-407 Crossref Scopus (75) PubMed Google Scholar 67. Pause, A. ∙ Méthot, N. ∙ Svitkin, Y. ...

Svitkin, Y.V. ∙ Pause, A. ∙ Haghighat, A. ... The requirement for eukaryotic initiation factor 4A (elF4A) in translation is in direct proportion to the degree of mRNA 5′ secondary structure RNA. 2001; 7 :382-394 Crossref Scopus (353) PubMed Google Scholar ) repressed SG formation similarly to WT eIF4A ( Figures 4 E and 4F). This indicates that, at least when overexpressed, eIF4A does not require ATP hydrolysis to limit SG formation, suggesting a model whereby eIF4A acts as an ATP-dependent RNA binding protein to inhibit SG formation, with ATP hydrolysis serving to release the RNA from eIF4A. These effects are independent of translation repression since cells with any of the eIF4A variants overexpressed repressed translation equally in response to arsenite treatment ( Figure 4 G).
Since other RNA helicases likely function to limit RNA condensation, we tested whether a closely related DEAD-box protein, DDX19A/DBP5 ( Cencic and Pelletier, 2016 15. Cencic, R. ∙ Pelletier, J. Hippuristanol - A potent steroid inhibitor of eukaryotic initiation factor 4A Translation (Austin). 2016; 4 :e1137381 PubMed Google Scholar ), could prevent SG formation in an analogous manner to eIF4A1. Hochberg-Laufer et al. (2019) 31. Hochberg-Laufer, H. ∙ Schwed-Gross, A. ∙ Neugebauer, K.M. ... Uncoupling of nucleo-cytoplasmic RNA export and localization during stress Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 :4778-4797 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar reported that DDX19A overexpression inhibits the formation of SGs induced by the transcriptional inhibitor tubercidin by an unknown mechanism. We reasoned that DDX19A could also limit RNA condensation since its helicase core sequence is highly similar to eIF4A. Overexpression of mCherry-DDX19A inhibited arsenite-induced SG formation to a similar extent as eIF4A, while overexpression of mCherry alone did not decrease SG formation ( Figures S4 E and S4G). Similar to eIF4A, overexpression of RNA-binding-deficient DDX19A fails to inhibit SG formation, while overexpression of an ATP hydrolysis mutant still inhibits SG formation ( Figures S4 E and S4G). This demonstrates that multiple ATP-dependent RNA chaperones can limit RNP condensation, consistent with ATP depletion having a larger effect on SG formation than eIF4A inhibition alone ( Figure 4 A).
Heterotypic RNP granules, like SGs and PBs ( Kedersha et al., 2005 45. Kedersha, N. ∙ Stoecklin, G. ∙ Ayodele, M. ... Stress granules and processing bodies are dynamically linked sites of mRNP remodeling J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169 :871-884 Crossref Scopus (1139) PubMed Google Scholar ) or nuclear speckles and paraspeckles ( Fox et al., 2002 26. Fox, A.H. ∙ Lam, Y.W. ∙ Leung, A.K. ... Paraspeckles: a novel nuclear domain Curr. Biol. 2002; 12 :13-25 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (432) PubMed Google Scholar ), often dock in cells. Since heterotypic RNA condensates minimize their surface free energy through RNA-RNA docking interactions ( Figure 1 A), we hypothesized that PB/SG interfaces might occur through intermolecular RNA interactions. If so, the docking of PBs and SGs would be predicted to be modulated by eIF4A. To test this possibility, we treated cells with arsenite, either alone or with Hipp or PatA, and then quantified PB/SG interfaces. We normalized the docking frequency of PBs and SGs to either the total amount of PBs or SGs or to the total PB or SG area to control for the possibility that drug additions affected the amount or sizes of either RNP granule. We observed that the docking frequency of PBs and SGs increased with Hipp addition compared to arsenite or arsenite and PatA, regardless of normalization ( Figure 5 ). When normalized to PB area, the difference between Hipp and PatA was not statistically significant, probably because PatA led to a decrease in total PB area ( Figure 5 F). These observations suggest that eIF4A can limit docking interactions between PBs and SGs, although whether this is directly due to altering trans RNA-RNA interactions between PB and SG RNAs remains to be established.
To determine whether eIF4A was sufficient to limit RNA condensation, we examined how recombinant eIF4A1 affected the formation of RNA condensates in vitro . We assessed RNA condensate formation by observing RNA condensates stained with SYTO RNASelect, an RNA-specific fluorescent dye. RNA condensates were formed from total yeast RNA in physiological K + and polyamine concentrations in the presence of polyethylene glycol to simulate the crowded cellular environment ( Zimmerman, 1993; Ellis, 2001; Delarue et al., 2018 19. Delarue, M. ∙ Brittingham, G.P. ∙ Pfeffer, S. ... mTORC1 Controls Phase Separation and the Biophysical Properties of the Cytoplasm by Tuning Crowding Cell. 2018; 174 :338-349.e20 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (263) PubMed Google Scholar 21. Ellis, R.J. Macromolecular crowding: obvious but underappreciated Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26 :597-604 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1863) PubMed Google Scholar 96. Zimmerman, S.B. Macromolecular crowding effects on macromolecular interactions: some implications for genome structure and function Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1216 :175-185 Crossref Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ). We performed these experiments with 10 μM eIF4A1, which is its approximate cytosolic concentration ( Itzhak et al., 2016 36. Itzhak, D.N. ∙ Tyanova, S. ∙ Cox, J. ... Global, quantitative and dynamic mapping of protein subcellular localization eLife. 2016; 5 :e16950 Crossref Scopus (389) PubMed Google Scholar ), and with RNA at 150 μg/mL, which we estimate is the concentration of exposed open reading frame RNA during acute translational inhibition ( Van Treeck et al., 2018 92. Van Treeck, B. ∙ Protter, D.S.W. ∙ Matheny, T. ... RNA self-assembly contributes to stress granule formation and defining the stress granule transcriptome Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115 :2734-2739 Crossref Scopus (326) PubMed Google Scholar ). We then examined the formation of RNA condensates over time in the presence or absence of recombinant eIF4A1 with ATP or the non-hydrolyzable ATP analog adenylyl-imidodiphosphate (ADPNP). We observed that ATP alone had a small effect on RNA condensation, perhaps because it is essentially a monovalent RNA and could compete for RNA-RNA interactions; ADPNP had a similar effect ( Figure S6 ).
An important result was that RNA condensation, as assessed by fluorescent labeling was strongly reduced by the addition of eIF4A1 and ATP as compared to ATP alone ( Figures 6 A and 6B). eIF4A1 in the absence of ATP had no effect on RNA condensation ( Figure S6 ). This demonstrates that eIF4A1 in the presence of ATP can limit RNA condensation. The substitution of the non-hydrolyzable ADPNP for ATP still allowed eIF4A1 to limit RNA condensation, but less effectively ( Figures 6 A and 6B). Since eIF4A retains its ability to bind RNA when bound to ADPNP ( Lorsch and Herschlag, 1998a 55. Lorsch, J.R. ∙ Herschlag, D. The DEAD box protein eIF4A. 1. A minimal kinetic and thermodynamic framework reveals coupled binding of RNA and nucleotide Biochemistry. 1998; 37 :2180-2193 Crossref Scopus (175) PubMed Google Scholar ), this is consistent with ATP-dependent RNA binding being sufficient to limit RNA condensation and that process being increased in efficacy by ATP hydrolysis allowing eIF4A to perform multiple rounds of RNA binding.
To further address the mechanism of RNA condensation inhibition by eIF4A1 in vitro , we tested how Hipp and patA affected RNA condensation. Without eIF4A1, Hipp or PatA in the presence of ATP had no effects on condensate formation ( Figure S6 ). However, eIF4A1 incubated with Hipp before RNA addition did not prevent condensate formation ( Figures 6 A and 6C). Since Hipp prevents eIF4A from binding ATP and RNA, this argues that ATP and RNA binding are required for eIF4A to limit RNA condensation in vitro . In contrast, preincubation with PatA, which slightly increases the catalytic efficiency of eIF4A1 ( Low et al., 2005 57. Low, W.K. ∙ Dang, Y. ∙ Schneider-Poetsch, T. ... Inhibition of eukaryotic translation initiation by the marine natural product pateamine A Mol Cell. 2005; 20 :709-722 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (208) PubMed Google Scholar ), did not limit eIF4A1’s ability to prevent RNA condensate formation ( Figures 6 A and 6C). These data confirm our in vivo observations that Hipp, but not PatA, addition following translation inhibition in G3BP null cells can rescue SG formation by preventing eIF4A’s function in limiting RNA condensation.

Section: Discussion

Several observations argue that RNA condensation into RNP granules is a thermodynamically favored process that is countered by energy-consuming processes in the cell. First, multiple distinct RNAs are robust at self-assembly in vitro , including under physiological conditions of salts and polyamines ( Figures 1 and S1 ; Aumiller et al., 2016; Jain and Vale, 2017; Langdon et al., 2018; Van Treeck et al., 2018 5.

USA. 2018; 115 :2734-2739 Crossref Scopus (326) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, RNA generally requires lower concentrations to condense in vitro than intrinsically disordered proteins ( Van Treeck and Parker, 2018 91. Van Treeck, B. ∙ Parker, R. Emerging Roles for Intermolecular RNA-RNA Interactions in RNP Assemblies Cell. 2018; 174 :791-802 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (259) PubMed Google Scholar ). Second, we observe that condensates of different RNA composition can interact to reduce the surface free energy of the RNA condensates ( Figure 1 ). Third, multiple RNA condensates or purified SGs recruit RNAs to their surface in vitro ( Figure 2 ). Furthermore, in cells, ATP depletion promotes the mRNP condensation into SGs ( Figure 3 C), even in the absence of protein factors normally required for SG formation ( Figure 4 A), demonstrating that cells utilize energy to limit SG formation.
In vitro , we observe that the recruitment of RNAs to the surface of an RNA condensate creates a high local concentration, which promotes the formation of additional interactions between the molecules to further stabilize the RNA assembly ( Figure 2 ). This creates a positive feedback loop in RNA condensation. Thus, RNA condensation has the potential to create an “RNA entanglement catastrophe,” wherein extensive RNA condensation would limit the proper distribution and function of RNAs. An implication of these observations is that cells must contain mechanisms to limit the intermolecular interactions and condensation of RNA.
We present several lines of evidence arguing that eIF4A functions to limit cytosolic RNA condensation. First, inhibition of eIF4A1 function by knockdown or Hipp treatment, but not PatA, restores SG formation in cells lacking G3BP without changes in translational repression ( Figures 4 A and 4B). Second, overexpression of eIF4A1 limits arsenite-induced SG formation, although translation remains repressed ( Figures 4 E–4G and S4 D). Third, inhibition of the RNA binding and ATPase activity of eIF4A by Hipp treatment during arsenite stress enriches bulk and specific RNAs in SGs ( Figures 3 and S3 ). Fourth, inhibition of eIF4A RNA binding and ATPase activity with Hipp increases PB/SG docking events ( Figure 5 ). Finally, recombinant eIF4A1 is able to limit RNA condensation in vitro in an ATP-dependent manner ( Figure 6 ). Since inhibition of eIF4A helicase activity with Hipp does not alter the exchange rates of G3BP1 ( Figure S4 H), we interpret these observations to suggest that eIF4A limits RNA condensation by the disruption of intermolecular RNA-RNA interactions. Since RNA binding, but not ATP hydrolysis, is required for limiting SG formation when eIF4A1 is overexpressed ( Figures 4 E and 4F), RNA binding is the critical feature of eIF4A’s ability to limit RNA condensation.
These results synergize well with biochemical data on the eIF4A helicase mechanism. RNA duplex unwinding by eIF4A and other DEAD-box proteins is coupled not so much to ATP hydrolysis as to the ATP-dependent binding of eIF4A to the RNA substrate, which kinks RNA to locally destabilize the duplex, which may then dissociate thermally ( Rogers et al., 1999, 2001; Liu et al., 2008; Putnam and Jankowsky, 2013 54. Liu, F. ∙ Putnam, A. ∙ Jankowsky, E. ATP hydrolysis is required for DEAD-box protein recycling but not for duplex unwinding Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105 :20209-20214 Crossref Scopus (194) PubMed Google Scholar 69. Putnam, A.A. ∙ Jankowsky, E. DEAD-box helicases as integrators of RNA, nucleotide and protein binding Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2013; 1829 :884-893 Crossref Scopus (147) PubMed Google Scholar 72. Rogers, Jr., G.W. ∙ Richter, N.J. ∙ Merrick, W.C.

Chem. 2001; 276 :12598-12608 Crossref Scopus (118) PubMed Google Scholar ). Hence, productive unwinding events are determined in part by the relative thermostability of the RNA·eIF4A·ATP complex compared to the structured RNA, limiting eIF4A’s ability to efficiently resolve duplexes more stable than ∼10–15 bp (Δ G approximately –20–25 kcal/mol; Rogers et al., 1999, 2001 72. Rogers, Jr., G.W. ∙ Richter, N.J. ∙ Merrick, W.C. Biochemical and kinetic characterization of the RNA helicase activity of eukaryotic initiation factor 4A J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274 :12236-12244 Crossref Scopus (261) PubMed Google Scholar 73. Rogers, Jr., G.W. ∙ Lima, W.F. ∙ Merrick, W.C. Further characterization of the helicase activity of eIF4A. Substrate specificity J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276 :12598-12608 Crossref Scopus (118) PubMed Google Scholar ). This may provide insight into the nature of the trans RNA interactions that drive RNA condensation and recruitment to condensates, namely that they are individually rather weak, despite their apparent thermostability in summation. Thus, ATP serves as a molecular switch to increase the affinity of the protein for RNA, while ATP hydrolysis and P i release cause conformational changes to lower the affinity of eIF4A for RNA, effectively making eIF4A function as an ATP-dependent RNA binding protein ( Lorsch and Herschlag, 1998a, 1998b; Sun et al., 2014 55. Lorsch, J.R. ∙ Herschlag, D. The DEAD box protein eIF4A. 1. A minimal kinetic and thermodynamic framework reveals coupled binding of RNA and nucleotide Biochemistry. 1998; 37 :2180-2193 Crossref Scopus (175) PubMed Google Scholar 56.

Single-molecule kinetics of the eukaryotic initiation factor 4AI upon RNA unwinding Structure. 2014; 22 :941-948 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ). Taken together, we suggest that while the binding of eIF4A to RNA is the key step in limiting RNA condensation, the ATPase-driven cycling of eIF4A on and off transcripts increases its ability to limit trans interactions by allowing multiple RNA binding events ( Figure 7 A). Accordingly, eIF4A limits RNA condensation as an ATP-dependent RNA binding protein, providing the cell with a controllable means of buffering intermolecular RNA interactions.
We anticipate that the ATP-dependent RNA binding of eIF4A, and possibly other DEAD-box proteins, will also modulate the formation of intramolecular RNA duplexes. Such a mechanism of limiting or buffering RNA secondary structure in cells could explain why predicted local RNA secondary structure does not strongly affect the ability of the PUM2 protein to bind target sites in mRNAs ( Jarmoskaite et al., 2019 43. Jarmoskaite, I. ∙ Denny, S.K. ∙ Vaidyanathan, P.P. ... A Quantitative and Predictive Model for RNA Binding by Human Pumilio Proteins Mol. Cell. 2019; 74 :966-981.e18 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Since overexpressing ATPase-defective DEAD-box mutants was sufficient to prevent SGs ( Figures 4 and S5 ), it is likely that high concentrations of monovalent RNA binding proteins can also reduce the condensation of RNA. This is consistent with the observation that overexpression of the abundant RNA binding protein YB-1 can limit the formation of SGs and the accumulation of certain transcripts in them, consistent with its RNP chaperone abilities in vitro ( Bounedjah et al., 2014; Tanaka et al., 2014 11. Bounedjah, O. ∙ Desforges, B. ∙ Wu, T.D. ... Free mRNA in excess upon polysome dissociation is a scaffold for protein multimerization to form stress granules Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 :8678-8691 Crossref Scopus (127) PubMed Google Scholar 86. Tanaka, T. ∙ Ohashi, S. ∙ Kobayashi, S. Roles of YB-1 under arsenite-induced stress: translational activation of HSP70 mRNA and control of the number of stress granules Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2014; 1840 :985-992 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cells appear to have adapted to make use of this mechanism across domains of life; for instance, the bacterial cold shock protein CspA is present at high intracellular concentrations (∼30 μM) and ameliorates global RNA structure during the cold shock response, possibly including trans RNA-RNA interactions ( Zhang et al., 2018 95. Zhang, Y. ∙ Burkhardt, D.H. ∙ Rouskin, S. ... A Stress Response that Monitors and Regulates mRNA Structure Is Central to Cold Shock Adaptation Mol. Cell. 2018; 70 :274-286.e7 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (129) PubMed Google Scholar ).
A general role for eIF4A in limiting RNA condensation in the cytosol provides an answer to the decades-old question of why eIF4A is present at ∼10x higher concentrations than other translation initiation factors ( Figure 3 A; Pause et al., 1994 67. Pause, A. ∙ Méthot, N. ∙ Svitkin, Y. ... Dominant negative mutants of mammalian translation initiation factor eIF-4A define a critical role for eIF-4F in cap-dependent and cap-independent initiation of translation EMBO J. 1994; 13 :1205-1215 Crossref Scopus (337) PubMed Google Scholar ). Since ATP depletion is more effective at rescuing SG formation in cell lines lacking G3BP ( Figure 4 A) and has a larger effect on mRNA recruitment to SGs during arsenite stress ( Figure 3 C), we suggest that additional ATP-dependent mechanisms, potentially including other SG-associated DEAD-box proteins ( Figure 3 A), also limit RNP condensation into SGs. Consistent with other DEAD-box proteins limiting SG formation, we demonstrate that overexpression of DDX19A, which is closely related to eIF4A ( Cencic and Pelletier, 2016 15. Cencic, R. ∙ Pelletier, J. Hippuristanol - A potent steroid inhibitor of eukaryotic initiation factor 4A Translation (Austin). 2016; 4 :e1137381 PubMed Google Scholar ), can limit SG formation without affecting translation ( Figures S4 E–S4G). Interestingly, knockout of the helicase DHX36 leads to increased SG formation, but this appears to be due to constitutive activation of the eIF2α kinase PKR and increased translation repression ( Sauer et al., 2019 78. Sauer, M. ∙ Juranek, S.A. ∙ Marks, J. ... DHX36 prevents the accumulation of translationally inactive mRNAs with G4-structures in untranslated regions Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :2421 Crossref Scopus (97) PubMed Google Scholar ). An important area of future work will be identifying additional helicases that limit RNA condensation and determining whether they act in RNA-specific manners.
The generality of RNA condensation predicts it will be relevant to other RNP granules. Indeed, observations in the literature are consistent with other RNA helicases functioning to limit RNA retention in RNA condensates. For example, knockdown of the RNA helicase UAP56/DDX39B (which is related to eIF4A; Cencic and Pelletier, 2016 15. Cencic, R. ∙ Pelletier, J. Hippuristanol - A potent steroid inhibitor of eukaryotic initiation factor 4A Translation (Austin). 2016; 4 :e1137381 PubMed Google Scholar ), leads to increased accumulation of polyA + RNA and spliced β-globin mRNA in nuclear speckles ( Dias et al., 2010 20. Dias, A.P. ∙ Dufu, K. ∙ Lei, H. ... A role for TREX components in the release of spliced mRNA from nuclear speckle domains Nat. Commun. 2010; 1 :97 Crossref Scopus (141) PubMed Google Scholar ), which are RNP granules formed near sites of transcription. Similarly, catalytic UAP56 mutations lead to retention of influenza M mRNAs in speckles ( Hondele et al., 2019 33. Hondele, M. ∙ Sachdev, R. ∙ Heinrich, S. ... DEAD-box ATPases are global regulators of phase-separated organelles Nature. 2019; 573 :144-148 Crossref Scopus (247) PubMed Google Scholar ). Additionally, knockdown of the UPF1 RNA helicase leads to retention of nascent transcripts in nuclear foci with DNA ( Singh et al., 2019 83. Singh, A.K. ∙ Choudhury, S.R. ∙ De, S. ... The RNA helicase UPF1 associates with mRNAs co-transcriptionally and is required for the release of mRNAs from gene loci eLife. 2019; 8 :e41444 Crossref Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ), where a high local concentration of nascent RNA might lead to RNA entanglements. These results suggest that RNA chaperones may be generally required to prevent the trapping of RNAs in energy wells at RNP granules. Additional mechanisms cells could utilize to limit RNA condensation include ribosome association, modulating RNA concentrations through RNA decay ( Burke et al., 2019 13. Burke, J.M. ∙ Moon, S.L. ∙ Matheny, T. ... RNase L Reprograms Translation by Widespread mRNA Turnover Escaped by Antiviral mRNAs Mol. Cell. 2019; 75 :1203-1217.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (76) PubMed Google Scholar ) or synthesis rates, and RNA modifications that alter the stability of RNA-RNA interactions.
DEAD-box proteins play two additional roles in modulating the formation and fate of mRNPs that will impact RNP granule assembly. First, in contrast to eIF4A1, many DEAD-box proteins have N- and C-terminal extensions that can play additional roles in promoting individual mRNP or mRNP granule assembly through additional protein-protein interactions ( Hilliker et al., 2011; Mugler et al., 2016; Rao and Parker, 2017; Sachdev et al., 2019 30. Hilliker, A. ∙ Gao, Z. ∙ Jankowsky, E. ... The DEAD-box protein Ded1 modulates translation by the formation and resolution of an eIF4F-mRNA complex Mol. Cell. 2011; 43 :962-972 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (172) PubMed Google Scholar 63. Mugler, C.F. ∙ Hondele, M. ∙ Heinrich, S. ... ATPase activity of the DEAD-box protein Dhh1 controls processing body formation eLife. 2016; 5 :e18746 Crossref Scopus (94) PubMed Google Scholar 70. Rao, B.S. ∙ Parker, R. Numerous interactions act redundantly to assemble a tunable size of P bodies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :E9569-E9578 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar 76. Sachdev, R. ∙ Hondele, M. ∙ Linsenmeier, M. ... Pat1 promotes processing body assembly by enhancing the phase separation of the DEAD-box ATPase Dhh1 and RNA eLife. 2019; 8 :e41415 Crossref Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ). In some cases, these N- and C-terminal extensions might contribute to RNP granule assembly by promoting RNP phase transitions ( Hondele et al., 2019 33. Hondele, M. ∙ Sachdev, R. ∙ Heinrich, S. ... DEAD-box ATPases are global regulators of phase-separated organelles Nature. 2019; 573 :144-148 Crossref Scopus (247) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, ATP hydrolysis by DEAD-box proteins can also promote rearrangements in mRNPs, allowing the mRNA to undergo subsequent processing, translation, or degradation events that will alter the ability of the mRNP to assemble into an RNP granule ( Hilliker et al., 2011; Sheth and Parker, 2006; Mugler et al., 2016 30. Hilliker, A. ∙ Gao, Z. ∙ Jankowsky, E. ... The DEAD-box protein Ded1 modulates translation by the formation and resolution of an eIF4F-mRNA complex Mol. Cell. 2011; 43 :962-972 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (172) PubMed Google Scholar 63. Mugler, C.F. ∙ Hondele, M. ∙ Heinrich, S. ... ATPase activity of the DEAD-box protein Dhh1 controls processing body formation eLife. 2016; 5 :e18746 Crossref Scopus (94) PubMed Google Scholar 81. Sheth, U. ∙ Parker, R. Targeting of aberrant mRNAs to cytoplasmic processing bodies Cell. 2006; 125 :1095-1109 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (235) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, DEAD-box proteins can either promote or limit RNP granule assembly in a context-dependent manner.
A role for eIF4A, and other general RNA helicases, in limiting RNA condensation can be considered analogous to protein chaperones, such as HSP70, limiting the aggregation of misfolded proteins ( Figure 7 ). Multiple protein chaperones, including HSP70 proteins, bind to protein aggregates to disassemble aberrant interactions, thereby allowing for aggregate solubilization and protein refolding, using ATP hydrolysis as a switch for binding ( Mogk et al., 2018 61. Mogk, A. ∙ Bukau, B. ∙ Kampinga, H.H. Cellular handling of protein aggregates by disaggregation machines Mol. Cell. 2018; 69 :214-226 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (240) PubMed Google Scholar ). We suggest that RNA condensation and inappropriate aggregation occurs when the amount of exposed RNA in the cell exceeds the capacity of the cellular machinery limiting RNA condensation. Thus, the intrinsic aggregation properties of both proteins and RNAs are countered by abundant cellular machinery to keep these macromolecules correctly folded and dispersed for proper function.

Following linearization, plasmid DNA was recovered with ethanol precipitation followed by resuspension in TE buffer (10 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA).
In vitro transcription of fluorescent RNAs was performed using the T7 MEGAscript kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations with the following modification: Addition of unlabeled UTP was reduced by 25% and an equal amount of fluorescently labeled UTP (fluorescein-12-UTP or cyanine-5-UTP, Enzo Life Sciences) was added into the reaction mixture. Following transcription, DNA was removed by treating with TURBO DNase I (Ambion) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. RNA was recovered by sequential acid phenol/chloroform and chloroform extractions, followed by precipitation in isopropanol and NH 4 OAc. RNA recovery was quantified via UV-Vis at 260 nm using a Nanodrop 2000 device (Thermo-Fischer). Proper RNA sizes were validated through either denaturing gel electrophoresis or Agilent TapeStation RNA ScreenTape analysis (performed by the BioFrontiers Next-Generation Sequencing Core Facility). Recovered RNA was resuspended in RNase-free water (Invitrogen) or TE and stored at –80°C. Working 100 μg/mL stocks were created as needed by diluting appropriately into RNase-free water and kept at –80°C.
Homopolymer RNAs were purchased as salts from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Inc. and Sigma-Aldrich and made into 25 mg/mL stock solutions in TE or RNase-free water, then kept at –80°C. Working 5 mg/mL stock solutions were prepared by diluting into RNase-free water. These working stocks were stored at –80°C or –20°C. The fluorescently-labeled oligonucleotides were purchased from IDT and resuspended, from which 2 μM stock solutions were made and stored at –80°C. An initial aliquot of the fluorescently-labeled PTR ( p olypyrimidine t ract R NA) was purchased from IDT and was stored at –80°C as a 2 μM stock solution.
To form homopolymer condensates for the short RNA localization experiments, homopolymer RNA was condensed as described previously ( Van Treeck et al., 2018 92. Van Treeck, B. ∙ Protter, D.S.W. ∙ Matheny, T. ... RNA self-assembly contributes to stress granule formation and defining the stress granule transcriptome Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115 :2734-2739 Crossref Scopus (326) PubMed Google Scholar ), with the addition of 200 nM fluorescent RNA oligos in the condensation mix. Briefly, 500 μg/mL homopolymer RNA were denatured at 95°C for 2 min, cooled on ice for 30 s, then mixed with 750 mM NaCl, 10% w/v PEG 3350. To localize in vitro transcribed RNAs, homopolymer RNA was condensed with the transcribed RNA in the same manner as above, but instead mixed with 150 mM NaOAc, 600 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl 2 , and 10% w/v PEG 3350 (all in RNase-free water) to a final homopolymer concentration of 0.4 mg/mL and a final mRNA/lncRNA concentration of 10 μg/mL, yielding an approximate pH of 7 as assessed by pH paper.
To mechanically disrupt polyC/polyU condensate networks, condensates were first prepared in glass bottom 96-well plates and incubated for an h. Thereafter, condensates were pipetted into adjacent empty wells, and pipetted up and down quickly five times. Afterward, they were immediately imaged.
CUG repeat foci were prepared by condensing 200 μg/mL of fluorescein-labeled DMPK Exons 11-15 -CUG 590 RNA as in Jain and Vale (2017) 38. Jain, A. ∙ Vale, R.D. RNA phase transitions in repeat expansion disorders Nature. 2017; 546 :243-247 Crossref Scopus (556) PubMed Google Scholar , in the presence or absence of 10 μg/mL Cy5-labeled in vitro transcribed RNAs or 200 nM PTR-Cy3. Briefly, RNAs were mixed together in a buffer of 10 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM Tris HCl pH 6.8, and 25 mM NaCl, and subsequently denatured for 3 min at 95°C then cooled at ∼4°C/min to 37°C in a thermocycler. Afterward, condensates were immediately imaged.
To test the ability of SGs to recruit in vitro transcribed RNAs, SGs were purified as follows: First, GFP-G3BP1 U2OS cells were seeded at ∼40% confluency and then grown to ∼80% confluency, after which the media was replaced and the cells were stressed with 500 μM arsenite for 60 min. Afterward, the cells were washed, pelleted, and flash-frozen in liquid N 2 , then stored at –80°C for up to a week. SGs were isolated as in Khong et al. (2018) 49. Khong, A. ∙ Jain, S. ∙ Matheny, T. ... Isolation of mammalian stress granule cores for RNA-Seq analysis Methods. 2018; 137 :49-54 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar to produce SG-enriched fractions. Briefly, the cell pellet was thawed on ice and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4], 100 mM KOAc, 2 mM MgOAc 2 , 0.5 mM DTT, 50 μg/mL heparin, complete mini EDTA protease inhibitor [Sigma-Aldrich 11836170001], 1 U/μl RNasin Plus RNase Inhibitor [Promega N2615]) after which cells were lysed by passing them through a 25G 5/8 needle several times. Afterward, cellular debris was removed by a 1000 x g spin (5 min), and SGs were enriched by two 18,000 x g spins (20 min each) followed by resuspension in lysis buffer. SG-enriched fractions were isolated through a final 850 x g spin (2 min). No affinity purification was performed. Other cellular debris was removed from the SG-enriched supernatant through both vigorous pipetting and by passing the supernatant through a 25G 5/8 needle, accompanied by quick spins. RNA recruitment to SGs was assessed by incubating 10 μg/mL Cy5-labeled luciferase RNA with SGs for 10 min at room temperature, followed by imaging.
To test the stability of RNA assemblies under dilution, pgc -decorated polyA droplets were prepared as above and incubated 2 h. Thereafter, they were subjected to spinning disk confocal time-lapse microscopy. Every 18 s, an image was taken in each channel in a 4x4 grid of adjacent frames using the Nikon Elements software “Large Image” tool. These images were automatically stitched together. Dilutions were performed while imaging was ongoing. In between imaging time points, TE buffer was quickly added dropwise (so as to only minimally disturb assemblies) to a tenfold final dilution. The very next imaging time point was taken to be t = 0 for quantitative analysis.
To observe RNA-condensate-associated RNA-RNA interactions, 4’- aminomethyltrioxsalen (AMT) UV crosslinking was performed ( Frederiksen and Hearst, 1979 28. Frederiksen, S. ∙ Hearst, J.E. Binding of 4′-aminomethyl 4,5′,8-trimethyl psoralen to DNA, RNA and protein in HeLa cells and Drosophila cells Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 563 :343-355 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ). AMT was procured from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and solubilized to a final concentration of 1 mg/mL in DMSO. AMT stocks were stored at –20°C. Since AMT crosslinks pyrimidine residues, condensation-crosslinking experiments were performed using polyA condensates to avoid crosslinking the client RNA to the homopolymer scaffold.
In condensation-crosslinking experiments, RNA was demixed in the appropriate condition, but with the addition of 100 μg/mL AMT. Thus, droplets and gels were crosslinked in 600 mM NaCl, 150 mM NaOAc, 1 mM MgCl 2 , 10% PEG MW 3350, 0.1 mg/mL AMT. Crosslinking in solution conditions was performed in TE with 0.1 mg/mL AMT added. Following incubation, RNA was crosslinked by irradiating 15 min with 366 nm UV light. Afterward, samples were diluted 1:1.7 in TE and RNA was recovered by precipitation in 2 M LiCl. If RNA sample concentrations were low (e.g., gel conditions), 0.4 mg/mL polyA homopolymer RNA was added post-crosslinking and pre-precipitation as a carrier in order to promote efficient recovery.
Denaturing gel electrophoresis was performed to analyze fluorescent and crosslinked RNAs. RNA samples were mixed with either 6x formaldehyde loading dye (Ambion) or 2x formamide loading dye (95% deionized formamide, 0.025% w/v bromophenol blue, 5 mM EDTA) and denatured by incubation at 70°C for 15 min, followed by incubation on ice for 3 min. Samples were run in freshly-prepared 1% agarose, 1% formaldehyde denaturing gels in fresh 1x MOPS buffer (20 mM MOPS pH 7.0, 5 mM NaOAc, 1 mM EDTA) at 4-10 V/cm for 2.5-4 h.
Denaturing gels were imaged using a Typhoon FLA 9500 imaging system (GE) set to visualize the appropriate fluorescence signal from fluorescently-labeled RNAs. Crosslinking efficacies were quantified in ImageJ by measuring the integrated intensities of the monomer bands and higher-weight bands, subtracting the average of 10-15 background measurements, and dividing the sum of the corrected higher-weight integrated intensities by the sum of all band integrated intensities. In symbols: C E = ∑ 𝑁 𝑛 = 2 𝐼 𝑛 ∑ 𝑁 𝑛 = 1 𝐼 𝑛 × 1 0 0 % , where I n is the (background-corrected) integrated intensity of the band corresponding to the RNA n -mer, N is the highest order band observed in a given sample, and CE is the crosslinking efficacy.
Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain BY4741 was grown to an OD600 of 0.8 AU and was lysed with 425-600 μm glass beads (Sigma-Aldrich) and vortexing for 10 min in a 50 mL conical tube in TRIzol (Ambion). RNA was extracted by using TRIzol reagent according to manufacturer’s instructions. Purified RNA concentration was determined via absorbance at 260 nm using a Nanodrop 2000 device (Thermo Scientific).
To assess the ability of eIF4A1 to decondense RNA in vitro , 10 μM recombinant eIF4A1 or protein storage buffer (200 mM NaCl, 25 mM Tris [pH 7.4], 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT) was mixed together in with 150 μg/mL yeast total RNA extracts, SYTO RNASelect green fluorescent dye, and either 1 mM ATP or ADPNP (Sigma-Aldrich) in 150 mM KOAc, 1 mM MgCl 2 , 0.223 mM spermine tetrahydrochloride, 1.34 mM spermidine trihydrochloride, and 8% w/v PEG 3350 in a glass bottom 96-well plate at 37°C. These conditions yield an approximate pH of ∼7.4. Polyamine levels recapitulate physiological concentrations ( Van Treeck et al., 2018 92. Van Treeck, B. ∙ Protter, D.S.W. ∙ Matheny, T. ... RNA self-assembly contributes to stress granule formation and defining the stress granule transcriptome Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115 :2734-2739 Crossref Scopus (326) PubMed Google Scholar ). Drug treatments were performed with DMSO, 10 μM hippuristanol, or 1 μM pateamine A. For each reaction, RNA condensate formation was observed after initial RNA addition by DIC and FITC channels over 30 min with images taken every 5 min. %Droplet area was analyzed using “Particle finder” in ImageJ.
For drug treatments or transfections, cells were seeded at ∼10 5 cells/mL and were allowed to adhere overnight. For siRNA experiments, cells were transfected with 50 nM of scrambled or eIF4A1 siRNA (see Table S1 ) using Interferin (polyPLUS) according to the manufacturer’s instructions for 48 h before SG induction. For overexpression experiments, cells were transfected with control (pcDNA3.1, Addgene) or pcDNA3.1-Myc-eIF4A1 (Addgene) plasmids for 48 h prior to SG induction or pmCherry (control) or pmCherry-DDX19A plasmids for DDX19A overexpression.
To induce SGs, arsenite (500 μM in H 2 O, Sigma-Aldrich), hippuristanol (Hipp, 300 nM or 1 μM in DMSO), or Pateamine A (PatA, 100 nM in DMSO) were added and cells were incubated at 37°C for the allotted times indicated in each assay. To deplete ATP, cells were incubated with 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG, 200 mM in H 2 O, Sigma-Aldrich) and carbonyl cyanide m -chlorophenyl hydrazine (CCCP, 100 μM in DMSO, Sigma-Aldrich). For ribopuromycinylation assays, cells were incubated at 37°C with puromycin (10 μg/mL in H 2 O, Sigma-Aldrich) 5 min prior to fixation or lysis.
Following drug treatment or transfection, cells were washed with 37°C phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and lysed with NP-40 lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40 and protease inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Scientific)). Cell lysates were rocked at 4°C for 30 min, and then clarified by centrifugation (13K RPM for 60 s). 4x Nu-PAGE sample buffer was added to lysates to a final concentration of 1x, samples were boiled for 5 min at 95°C, and then loaded into 4%–12% Bis-Tris Nu-PAGE gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were blocked with 5% BSA in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween-20 (TBST) for an h and then incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4°C. Membranes were washed 3x with TBST, then incubated at room temperature for 2 h in 5% BSA in TBST. Membranes were washed 3x again in TBST and antibody detection was achieved by rocking membranes in Pierce ECL western blotting substrate for 5 min.
Chemiluminescence was visualized on an Image Quant LAS 4000 (GE). Protein band densities were quantified in ImageJ.
DNA smFISH probes targeting human MCM2 mRNA were prepared as follows. First, probe sequences were designed using the Stellaris RNA FISH Probe Designer software (Biosearch Technologies). Probe DNA sequences were synthesized by IDT, and the oligos were pooled. Pooled smFISH probes were then 3′ labeled by 5-Propargylamino-dideoxy-UTP-Atto633 (ddUTP-Atto633) as in Gaspar et al. (2017) 29. Gaspar, I. ∙ Wippich, F. ∙ Ephrussi, A. Enzymatic production of single-molecule FISH and RNA capture probes RNA. 2017; 23 :1582-1591 Crossref Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar . Briefly, pooled probes were mixed with a threefold excess of ddUTP-Atto633, with the labeling reaction performed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT).
Cells were prepared as described as stated above except grown on No. 1.5 glass coverslips (Thermo). Sequential IF/FISH or IF/smFISH was performed as previously described ( Khong et al., 2017, 2018 48. Khong, A. ∙ Matheny, T. ∙ Jain, S. ... The Stress Granule Transcriptome Reveals Principles of mRNA Accumulation in Stress Granules Mol. Cell. 2017; 68 :808-820.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (460) PubMed Google Scholar 49. Khong, A. ∙ Jain, S. ∙ Matheny, T. ... Isolation of mammalian stress granule cores for RNA-Seq analysis Methods. 2018; 137 :49-54 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ). When IF was performed without FISH, fixed U2OS cells were instead blocked with 5% BSA in PBS for 1 h prior to IF and the antibodies were diluted in 5% BSA in PBS.
Alternatively, fixed cells were simultaneously blocked and permeabilized with 5% BSA in PBS-T (0.1% Triton X-100) for 1 h at room temperature. Thereafter, coverslips were incubated with primary antibody (1:500) overnight at 4°C in 1% BSA in PBS-T. Coverslips were then washed 3X with PBS and incubated with secondary antibody (1:1000) at room temperature for 2 h in 1% BSA in PBS-T.
The primary antibodies used for immunofluorescence (IF) include mouse anti-G3BP1 (5 μg/mL, ab56574(Abcam)), rabbit anti-DDX1 (1:100, 11357-1-AP (Proteintech)), and rabbit anti-eIF4A1 (100 μg/mL, ab31217(Abcam)) and the appropriate secondary antibodies used were goat anti-mouse FITC antibody (1:1000, Abcam (ab6785)), and donkey anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 555 conjugate antibody (1:500, Abcam (ab150062).
NORAD , PEG3 , and DYNH1C1 smFISH probes were custom made using Stellaris® RNA FISH probe Designer (Biosearch Technologies, Inc., Petaluma, CA). The probe sequences are listed in Table S1 . AHNAK -Quasar670, TFRC -Quasar570, and POLR2A -Quasar570 probes were purchased premade directly from Biosearch Technologies and resuspended according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. AHNAK smFISH probe sequences are in Khong et al. (2017) 48. Khong, A. ∙ Matheny, T. ∙ Jain, S. ... The Stress Granule Transcriptome Reveals Principles of mRNA Accumulation in Stress Granules Mol. Cell. 2017; 68 :808-820.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (460) PubMed Google Scholar . Oligo(dT)-Cy3 probes were purchased from IDT.
Fixed U2OS cells stained by IF and/or smFISH, purified SGs, CUG repeat RNA foci, and homopolymer condensates were imaged using a widefield DeltaVision Elite microscope with a 100x NA 1.5 oil objective using a PCO Edge sCMOS camera and SoftWoRx software (GE).
Condensate dilution and helicase assays were imaged using an inverted Nikon Ti Eclipse spinning disk confocal microscope equipped with an environmental chamber and Nikon elements software. Helicase assay imaging was performed at 37°C. All spinning disk confocal images were acquired with a 100x NA 1.5 oil objective and a 2x Andor Ultra 888 EMCCD camera.
FRAP assays were performed using an inverted Nikon A1R laser scanning confocal microscope equipped with an environmental chamber, a 100x NA 1.5 oil objective, and Nikon Elements software. At least three images were acquired prior to photobleaching followed imaging over the course of recovery. PolyA/ pgc FRAP was performed at room temperature.
To analyze recovery, the mean intensity of each bleached region was quantified in ImageJ, and recovery intensities were normalized to the mean of three pre-bleach measurements. Mobile fractions ϕ M were computed by subtracting the minimum normalized mean intensity I 0 from the normalized endpoint intensity I F : ϕ M = I F – I 0 . OligoU recovery in polyA droplets was modeled by a single association exponential curve using Prism Graphpad software.
Partial FRAP was performed similarly, but by only photobleaching approximately half the condensate area.
Center, dispersion, and precision measures are defined and found in the figure legends.
Values for n and p , and the meanings of n values are found in the figure legends. Statistical analyses were performed using the Student’s t test in Prism 8.0 (Graphpad) or Excel (Microsoft).
Single molecule FISH analysis was performed using Imaris (Bitplane) as in ( Khong et al., 2017, 2018; Khong and Parker, 2018 47. Khong, A. ∙ Parker, R. mRNP architecture in translating and stress conditions reveals an ordered pathway of mRNP compaction J. Cell Biol. 2018; 217 :4124-4140 Crossref Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar 48. Khong, A. ∙ Matheny, T. ∙ Jain, S. ... The Stress Granule Transcriptome Reveals Principles of mRNA Accumulation in Stress Granules Mol. Cell. 2017; 68 :808-820.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (460) PubMed Google Scholar 49. Khong, A. ∙ Jain, S. ∙ Matheny, T. ... Isolation of mammalian stress granule cores for RNA-Seq analysis Methods. 2018; 137 :49-54 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, processed Z stacks are opened and the nuclei masked using the DAPI channel. Thereafter, smFISH spots are identified in 3D using the “Spots” tool and the automatic parameters. SGs are similarly identified in 3D with the “Cells” tool, with 3D masks rendered. The number of smFISH spots in SGs is quantified as the number of spots in the 3D rendered SGs. Thus, the fraction of RNA molecules in SGs, the data presented, is this value divided by the total number of smFISH spots identified.
G3BP1, eIF4A1, and oligo(dT) partitioning were quantified using Imaris Imaging Analysis software (Bitplane). In order to measure partitioning, first, the nuclei were masked using the DAPI source channel. Second, individual cells were segmented by creating a region of interest (manually determined) around a single cell using the surface creation wizard. Mean cellular fluorescence intensities for G3BP1, eIF4A1, and oligo(dT) were then obtained under the results tab. Third, SGs were identified using the G3BP1 fluorescent source channel with Imaris Cell Creation wizard with the following parameters (0.0406 μm filter width, manually-determined thresholding, and ≥ 1 voxel). Once SGs were identified by the cell creation wizard, they are then converted to surfaces in order to extract mean fluorescence intensities for G3BP1, eIF4A1 and oligo(dT) inside stress granules. Partitioning was then calculated by taking the ratio of the mean fluorescence intensity in SG to the mean fluorescence intensity in the cell. 20 cells were counted for each sample. For more detailed information, please see Khong et al. (2018) 49. Khong, A. ∙ Jain, S. ∙ Matheny, T. ... Isolation of mammalian stress granule cores for RNA-Seq analysis Methods. 2018; 137 :49-54 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar .
Line analysis was performed using ImageJ (FIJI). A straight line was drawn across a stress granule using G3BP1 as a source channel. The line is then saved as an ROI. The ROI was then pasted on the corresponding eIF4A1 or DDX1 source channel. Line intensities were then extracted in both channels using the “Plot Profile” tool. Stress granule boundaries (in each source channel) were determined by an intensity threshold halfway between the maximum and minimum intensity values for each source channel. Fifty linescan analyses were performed for each experiment.
Measurements of SG area or PB area per cell area were quantified using the “Particle Finder” tool in ImageJ. The percent of cells with SGs was quantified using the “Count” tool in ImageJ. The fluorescence intensity of puromycin-labeled nascent peptides in individual cells was quantified as mean gray values extracted from ImageJ.
SG and PB interface calculations were quantified by identifying regions of overlap between each mRNP granule and recording these events by using the “count” tool in ImageJ. Once total interfaces were counted, these values were normalized either to PB counts/area (determined using “analyze particles” in ImageJ) or SG counts/area (using “analyze particles” in ImageJ).
The index of dispersion (DI) is a statistical measure of inhomogeneity in a population and is defined to be D I = 𝜎 2 𝜇 , where σ 2 is the variance of the population distribution (with σ being the population standard deviation) and μ is the mean value. For example, particles in an ideal solution exhibit a dispersion index of 1, as they are Poisson distributed, and substantially higher values indicate particle-particle interactions in that context. Here, dispersion indices were used to quantify inhomogeneity in fluorescence signal and infer the relative extent to which an RNA is assembled, similarly to Jain and Vale (2017) 38. Jain, A. ∙ Vale, R.D. RNA phase transitions in repeat expansion disorders Nature. 2017; 546 :243-247 Crossref Scopus (556) PubMed Google Scholar .
Indices of dispersion were computed by measuring the mean fluorescence intensity and standard deviation for maximum projections of 1 μm Z stacks or single slices in the case of the dilution experiment. An index was computed for each image using ImageJ, and the displayed index was taken to be the average of the indices for all the separate images. The standard deviations for the distribution of index values for a given set of conditions were used to calculate 95% confidence intervals.
For HeLa and U2OS cells we used published values for eIF4A1 from quantitative mass spectroscopy, 1.7 × 10 7 and 2.2 × 10 6 , respectively ( Itzhak et al., 2016; Beck et al., 2011 7. Beck, M. ∙ Schmidt, A. ∙ Malmstroem, J. ... The quantitative proteome of a human cell line Mol. Syst. Biol. 2011; 7 :549 Crossref Scopus (633) PubMed Google Scholar 36. Itzhak, D.N. ∙ Tyanova, S. ∙ Cox, J. ... Global, quantitative and dynamic mapping of protein subcellular localization eLife. 2016; 5 :e16950 Crossref Scopus (389) PubMed Google Scholar ), and mRNA levels for U2OS cells, ∼330,000 ( Khong et al., 2017 48. Khong, A. ∙ Matheny, T. ∙ Jain, S. ... The Stress Granule Transcriptome Reveals Principles of mRNA Accumulation in Stress Granules Mol. Cell. 2017; 68 :808-820.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (460) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although previous estimates suggest HeLa cells might contain 200,000 mRNAs per cell ( Shapiro et al., 2013 80. Shapiro, E. ∙ Biezuner, T. ∙ Linnarsson, S. Single-cell sequencing-based technologies will revolutionize whole-organism science Nat. Rev. Genet. 2013; 14 :618-630 Crossref Scopus (875) PubMed Google Scholar ) we utilized an estimate of 330,000 mRNAs per cell to be conservative in our estimations. These calculations indicate a ratio of 6.7 eIF4A1 molecules/mRNA to 51 eIF4A molecules/mRNA in U2OS and HeLa cells respectively.
Statistical analyses were performed using the Student’s t test in Prism 8.0 (Graphpad) or Excel (Microsoft).
