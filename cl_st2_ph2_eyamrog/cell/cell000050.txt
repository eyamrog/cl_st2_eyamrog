Title: Propionic Acid Shapes the Multiple Sclerosis Disease Course by an Immunomodulatory Mechanism


Abstract: Summary

Short-chain fatty acids are processed from indigestible dietary fibers by gut bacteria and have immunomodulatory properties. Here, we investigate propionic acid (PA) in multiple sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune and neurodegenerative disease. Serum and feces of subjects with MS exhibited significantly reduced PA amounts compared with controls, particularly after the first relapse. In a proof-of-concept study, we supplemented PA to therapy-naive MS patients and as an add-on to MS immunotherapy. After 2 weeks of PA intake, we observed a significant and sustained increase of functionally competent regulatory T (Treg) cells, whereas Th1 and Th17 cells decreased significantly. Post-hoc analyses revealed a reduced annual relapse rate, disability stabilization, and reduced brain atrophy after 3 years of PA intake. Functional microbiome analysis revealed increased expression of Treg-cell-inducing genes in the intestine after PA intake. Furthermore, PA normalized Treg cell mitochondrial function and morphology in MS. Our findings suggest that PA can serve as a potent immunomodulatory supplement to MS drugs.

Section: Introduction

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common non-traumatic neurological disease in industrialized countries, favoring young women at a ratio of 3–4:1. It is characterized by chronic autoimmune attacks against the white matter, typically resulting in destruction of the myelin sheath surrounding nerve axons within the central nervous system (CNS). This autoimmune component is a hallmark of MS and is characterized by an increase in pro-inflammatory autoreactive T cells, i.e., T helper (Th) 17 and Th1 cells and a decreased number and impaired function of regulatory T (Treg) cells ( Kleinewietfeld and Hafler, 2014 27. Kleinewietfeld, M. ∙ Hafler, D.A. Regulatory T cells in autoimmune neuroinflammation Immunol. Rev. 2014; 259 :231-244 Crossref Scopus (185) PubMed Google Scholar ). This imbalance between autoreactive and regulatory elements results in recurring tissue inflammation and partially mediates the ongoing neurodegeneration and subsequent neurological deficits in MS patients. When untreated, MS might lead to severe disability (e.g., paralysis, cognitive deficits, and autonomic dysfunction) as a result of this unhindered, early-occurring neurodegeneration ( Haghikia et al., 2013 23. Haghikia, A. ∙ Hohlfeld, R. ∙ Gold, R. ... Therapies for multiple sclerosis: translational achievements and outstanding needs Trends Mol. Med. 2013; 19 :309-319 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Recent investigations suggest that the rising number of MS cases and other autoimmune disorders worldwide can partially be attributed to environmental changes, particularly diet-consequent changes that might result in an altered gut microbiome ( Berer et al., 2017 4. Berer, K. ∙ Gerdes, L.A. ∙ Cekanaviciute, E. ... Gut microbiota from multiple sclerosis patients enables spontaneous autoimmune encephalomyelitis in mice Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :10719-10724 Crossref Scopus (634) PubMed Google Scholar ). The intestinal microbiota and immune cells interact between layers of the intestinal epithelial membrane known as gut-associated lymphatic tissue (GALT). The effect of diet on GALT can therefore be (1) direct by interaction between components of food and GALT; (2) indirect by interaction between gut microbiota-derived metabolites and GALT; or (3) indirect by diet-induced alterations in gut bacterial composition as a consequence of dietary habits, which, in turn, might influence the GALT ( Macia et al., 2012 35. Macia, L. ∙ Thorburn, A.N. ∙ Binge, L.C. ... Microbial influences on epithelial integrity and immune function as a basis for inflammatory diseases Immunol. Rev. 2012; 245 :164-176 Crossref Scopus (185) PubMed Google Scholar ). Among other environmental factors, such as smoking and reduced vitamin D, epidemiological studies have long suggested the involvement of excessive fat intake and obesity in the etiology of MS. Despite this, the direct effects of dietary aliphatic fatty acids on the cellular immune response and CNS pathology have been evaluated only recently ( Swank et al., 1952; Olsson et al., 2017; Endo et al., 2015; Haghikia et al., 2015 17.

Animal models of MS and inflammatory bowel disease, among others, provide incremental evidence that short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) such as propionic acid (PA) lead to a significant increase in the gut-associated Treg cell population, subsequent reduction of the systemic immune reaction, and accompanying disease amelioration ( Haghikia et al., 2015; Smith et al., 2013; Hung et al., 2013; Arpaia et al., 2013; Berer et al., 2011; Kwon et al., 2013 2.

Although currently available therapeutic interventions for MS aim to suppress pro-inflammatory (auto)immune responses (i.e., that of Th1, Th17, and B cells) ( Haghikia et al., 2013 23. Haghikia, A. ∙ Hohlfeld, R. ∙ Gold, R. ... Therapies for multiple sclerosis: translational achievements and outstanding needs Trends Mol. Med. 2013; 19 :309-319 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ), there is an unmet need for agents that address regulatory cell (dys)function and neurodegeneration. In this study, we analyzed whether subjects with MS have altered amounts of SCFAs and gut bacteria that produce them and whether the previously discovered Treg-cell-inducing effect of PA supplementation, seen previously in the experimental model, holds true in MS patients.

Section: Results

Serum and stool samples were collected from a large cohort of MS patients and healthy controls (HCs) ( Figures 1 A and S1 A; Table S1 ) to investigate changes in gut SCFA metabolites, their bacterial producers, and the effect of dietary PA on immune-regulatory elements ( Haghikia et al., 2015 24. Haghikia, A. ∙ Jörg, S. ∙ Duscha, A. ... Dietary Fatty Acids Directly Impact Central Nervous System Autoimmunity via the Small Intestine Immunity. 2015; 43 :817-829 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (627) PubMed Google Scholar ). The concentrations of butyric acid (BA), acetic acid (AA), and PA in biological samples were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) (metabolome cohort in Figure 1 A). PA was significantly reduced in the feces and serum of MS patients compared with HCs ( Figures 1 B and 1C). Reduced PA amounts were found across all investigated MS disease types (relapsing-remitting MS [RRMS], secondary progressive MS [SPMS], and primary progressive MS [PPMS]) ( Figures S1 B and S1C) with no differences between the subtypes. We detected no significant differences in the amount of BA and AA in MS patients compared with that in controls ( Figures S1 D–S1G) (one-way ANOVA, accounted for multiple testing with a significance threshold of 5%/3; PA, p = 0.0016 <5%/3; BA, not significant; AA, not significant). To exclude an influence of the various disease-modifying therapies on the patients’ PA amounts, we first stratified the original patients for individual MS therapies. After stratification, we detected a significant reduction in PA concentration in serum and fecal samples in the group with no disease-modifying drugs (DMDs), which consisted of the highest number of individuals (n = 17, data not shown). The other treatment groups (interferon, dimethyl fumarate, and fingolimod) included only a small number of patients, precluding properly powered statistical analysis. Correlation between disease duration and PA concentration in serum and fecal samples did not show any association. To validate these findings, we recruited a second validation cohort consisting of newly diagnosed ( de novo cohort) therapy-naive MS patients ( Figure 1 A). The significant reduction in PA in stool and serum of these patients confirmed our previous findings ( Figures 1 B and 1C), In our cohort, reduced amounts of PA were observed across all different MS subtypes and were assumed to be independent of disease-modifying therapies ( Figures S1 B and S1C). However, larger sample sizes are needed to verify whether disease-modifying therapies have an effect on PA amounts.
Because of an apparent reduced availability of PA in blood and fecal samples of MS patients, we investigated whether the gut microbiome composition of MS patients is altered and whether there is a link between reduced SCFA amounts and alterations in the microbiome. Therefore, we assessed a large and well-established cohort of MS patients and HCs (microbiome cohort in Figure 1 A; demographic details in Table S1 ). Although no large-scale community shifts were seen (alpha and beta diversity are not significantly different between HC and MS according to multivariate composition tests; Bray-Curtis permutational multivariate analysis of variance [PERMANOVA]), the relative abundance of a number of gut microbial taxa is altered in MS; trends replicated across MS subtypes and robustly to control for baseline immunomodulatory therapy ( Figure S1 H; Table S2 ). Depleted taxa include SCFA producers such as Butyricimonas . Compared with HCs, in MS patients, there was a higher abundance of pathogenic Flavonifractor ( Lemaire et al., 2018 31. Lemaire, M. ∙ Dou, S. ∙ Cahu, A. ... Addition of dairy lipids and probiotic Lactobacillus fermentum in infant formula programs gut microbiota and entero-insular axis in adult minipigs Sci. Rep. 2018; 8 :11656 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ) and Escherichia and Shigella ( Figure S1 H) as well as of the genus Collinsella , shown recently to be enriched under a high-fiber diet with expected low SCFA availability ( Gomez-Arango et al., 2018 22. Gomez-Arango, L.F. ∙ Barrett, H.L. ∙ Wilkinson, S.A. ... Low dietary fiber intake increases Collinsella abundance in the gut microbiota of overweight and obese pregnant women Gut Microbes. 2018; 9 :189-201 Crossref Scopus (228) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our data indicate that these observed taxonomic changes are not confounded by immunomodulatory therapy ( Table S2 ), nor are they MS subtype dependent (although the degree of these significant changes varies between disease courses). Thus, this gut dysbiosis is apparently characteristic of MS in general, although follow-up studies are necessary to characterize this phenotype in greater detail. We next tested whether PA supplementation might modulate these gut microbiome populations to produce a beneficial therapeutic effect. Although the observed changes are not reducible to the immunomodulatory therapies accounted for, our cohort does not have enough statistical power to exclude the possibility that such therapies might also have a separate effect.
Our comparative investigations of the MS cohort revealed reduced amounts of PA in serum and fecal samples that were accompanied by a reduction in SCFA-producing bacteria. Therefore, we hypothesized that reduced gut SCFA-producing bacteria limit systemic PA availability and contribute to the Treg and Th17 imbalance observed in MS and other autoimmune disorders. After ethics committee approval, we performed a translational proof-of-concept study in which we supplemented PA to patients’ existing immunomodulatory therapy under which the patients had been stable for 3.7 (±2.3) years (+PA cohort in Figure 1 A; demographic details in Table S1 ).
After initial dosage titration in HCs ( Figure 1 D), we treated 91 MS patients ( Table S1 ) and 24 HCs with PA (1,000 mg per day). Whole blood was collected prior to initial PA intake on day 0 and then again on day 14 for immune phenotyping and functional analysis of T cell subsets. Patients who voluntarily continued to take PA after the 14-day trial period were included in the longitudinal cohort. Fifty-two patients qualified for longitudinal assessment of immunological data (3.34 ± 1.59 months).
At baseline, MS patients displayed significantly reduced amounts of Treg cells compared with those in HCs ( Figure 1 E). Treg cell amounts increased by about 25% in HCs and 30% in MS patients after 14 days of PA supplementation ( Figures 1 E and 1F). The effect of PA on peripheral Treg cells was persistent in MS patients who chose to continue PA supplementation after day 14, regardless of MS subtype ( Figures 1 E and S2 A). These effects were replicated in a cohort of de novo MS patients, with PA supplementation also significantly increasing Treg cell amounts ( Figure 1 G). Furthermore, compared with HCs, MS patients displayed significantly elevated amounts of Th17 cells at baseline that were decreased significantly on day 14 and day 90 of PA treatment in the MS and de novo MS cohorts ( Figures 1 H, 1I, and S2 C). Th1 cell baseline amounts did not differ between MS patients and HCs; however, 2 weeks of PA supplementation significantly decreased Th1 cell counts in MS and de novo MS patients. This effect persisted until day 90 in the longitudinal MS cohort ( Figures 1 J, 1K, and S2 D). Although we detected no between-group differences in CD3 + T cells, CD19 + B cells, CD4 + Th cells, or natural killer (NK) cells, cytotoxic CD8 + T lymphocytes were significantly lower in MS patients compared with HCs at baseline ( Figures S2 E–S2I).
Additionally, we performed a pilot study of the effect of PA on another autoimmune disease, rheumatoid arthritis. Here, patients’ Treg cell amounts increased significantly by about 45% after 14 days and by 72% after 28 days on oral PA supplementation ( Figures S2 J and S2K). These results further support the general immunomodulatory properties of PA.
To further investigate whether the increase in Treg cells after PA treatment is accompanied by functional changes, as implied by the reduced amounts of Th17 and Th1 cells, we performed functional ex vivo analyses. Isolated Treg cells were cocultured with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from the same donor, and the suppressive capacity of Treg cells on PBMC proliferation was measured. PBMC proliferation in coculture with Treg cells isolated on day 0 was markedly higher in MS patients compared with HCs, indicating a diminished suppressive capacity of Treg cells from MS patients ( Figure 1 L). While under PA supplementation, the suppressive capacity of Treg cells was increased significantly in MS (RRMS and SPMS) and de novo MS patients but remained unaltered in HCs ( Figures 1 L–1N; and S2 B). Age, sex, disease duration, and disease severity had no confounding effect on Treg cell amounts or their functional capacity. Although patients under all MS drugs showed an increase in Treg cell numbers (except for glatiramer acetate) and function, when stratified according to immunomodulatory treatment, the strongest effect was seen for dimethyl fumarate and the B cell depletion approach (rituximab) ( Figures S3 A and S3B). Linear regression analysis indicated that Treg cell suppressive function did not depend on Treg cell numbers ( Figures S3 C and S3D).
To investigate whether the beneficial immunological effects induced by PA supplementation had an effect on the clinical course of MS, we assessed the longitudinal clinical data of 97 patients ( Figure 1 A; Table S1 ). All patients included had at least one continuous year of PA supplementation. Retrospective data for up to 6 years before PA initiation were available. Patients were stratified on the basis of annual relapse rate (ARR), level of disability as determined by the expanded disability status scale (EDSS; 0 represents no deficits, 4 indicates sustained impairment of walking distance, and 10 means death by MS), and assessment of the probability of disease progression. By stratifying patients according to their intra-individual changes in ARR after initiation of PA supplementation as well as their existing MS therapy, we observed that 41.2% of all included patients improved, 47.4% remained stable, and only 11.3% of patients exhibited an increased ARR ( Figure 2 B). Overall, the ARR before and after initiation of PA supplementation decreased significantly, from 0.24 to 0.08 (p = 0.0002) ( Figure 2 A). By incorporating the different underlying disease-modifying treatments, we observed a decrease in the ARR for almost all immunomodulatory treatments included in our cohort ( Figure S3 E). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, including 6 years before and up to 3 years after PA supplementation, revealed a reduced risk of disease progression in patients who received add-on PA compared with a cohort matched for age, sex, disease duration and severity, and immunomodulatory therapy that did not receive PA ( Figure 2 C). Furthermore, the EDSS was stabilized in the PA group compared with non-PA recipients within the aforementioned time frame ( Figure 2 D). Within the PA study cohort, no severe adverse events occurred. However, anecdotal reports of mild adverse events (i.e., abdominal distension, flatulence, and nausea) were reported in less than 5% of patients in the longitudinal cohort.
Twenty-two MS patients treated with supplemental PA underwent 1.5-T MRI scans at baseline and at a follow-up time point after an average of 1.5 years. The resultant images of the PA group were compared with those of 22 MS patients without PA (non-PA) matched for age, sex, therapy, and disease course procured at about the same time points ( Table S3 ).
Longitudinal analysis revealed significant global and regional volume reductions bilaterally in mid- and superior frontal as well as pre- and post-central regions in both groups ( Table S4 ).
Interestingly, significant volume increases were detected in the striatum of the PA group, specifically in the caudate, putamen, and globus pallidus ( Figure 2 E). These findings were further expanded by voxel-based analyses, including age, sex, and total intracranial volume as nuisance variables. Figure 2 E shows areas of bilateral volume increase in the caudate and putamen of the PA group.
We hypothesized that this effect of long-term PA supplementation might be mediated by an increase in PA in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Thus, we measured PA concentration in the CSF by LC-MS/MS in 3 MS patients who underwent lumbar puncture before and during PA supplementation for 2.78 – 0.08 months. The number of samples was limited because of invasive sample acquisition. Nonetheless, we detected a significant increase in PA concentration in the CSF after PA supplementation ( Figure S3 F).
To test whether PA intake-induced alterations of microbiome composition have functional consequences for local gut tissue, we assessed fecal samples of patients before and after 14 days of PA in an intestinal organ culture system ( Yissachar et al., 2017 57. Yissachar, N. ∙ Zhou, Y. ∙ Ung, L. ... An Intestinal Organ Culture System Uncovers a Role for the Nervous System in Microbe-Immune Crosstalk Cell. 2017; 168 :1135-1148.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (185) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 3 A). This system maintains the naive tissue structure and cellular components (including epithelial, immunological, and neuronal systems) but allows precise control over experimental conditions. It is important to note that, although our results regarding MS microbiota do not indicate any effect of a single preexisting immunomodulatory treatment, we lack the power to exhaustively explore the microbiome effects of such therapies, including the possibility that some drugs might act partially through microbiome modulation. Future studies with larger sample numbers are warranted to address this issue. Thus, this setup permits investigation of rapid luminal perturbation effects on gut-residing cells. For the analysis, the MS patient microbiome of responders (n = 5) and non-responders (n = 4) (responders had increased Treg cell amounts and function after 14 days of PA and non-responders did not) before and after PA intake were introduced individually into the gut culture system at equivalent bacterial loads (10 7 colony-forming units (CFUs)/mL), and bulk RNA sequencing of colon tissue was conducted after 2 h (study design, Figure 3 A; Figures 3 B and 3C display the individual Treg cell numbers as well as the suppressive capacity of patients tested; a total of 36 colon samples in two independent sequencing runs). Within-subject differential gene expression analysis of gut tissues colonized with the responder microbiome revealed increased expression of 129 transcripts and decreased expression of 314 (at a fold change of more than 2 and p < 0.05) after PA treatment. Conversely, a similar analysis of non-responder microbiome colonization revealed increased and decreased expression of 44 and 112 transcripts, respectively. To test whether these early transcriptional changes might be associated with initiation of Treg cell induction, we examined the transcriptional signatures of genes rapidly induced by Treg-cell-inducing microbes that have been shown recently to positively or negatively correlate with colonic RORγ + Treg cell induction ( Yissachar et al., 2017 57. Yissachar, N. ∙ Zhou, Y. ∙ Ung, L. ... An Intestinal Organ Culture System Uncovers a Role for the Nervous System in Microbe-Immune Crosstalk Cell. 2017; 168 :1135-1148.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (185) PubMed Google Scholar ). In responding patients, genes positively correlated with Treg cell induction were induced, whereas those negatively correlated were suppressed, suggesting that post-PA fecal material has Treg cell-inducing properties ( Figures 3 D, left and S4 A, left). Strikingly, microbiome collected from non-responding patients showed the opposite effect; genes positively correlated with Treg induction were suppressed, whereas genes negatively correlated with Treg cell induction were induced ( Figures 3 D, right and S4 A, right). Comparison of the bacterial load displayed a slight increase in the bacterial load of anaerobic bacteria after PA treatment, accompanied by a decrease in aerobic bacteria within all samples (n = 10), and when groups were separated into non-responders and responders (n = 5) ( Figure S4 B). These diametrically opposite transcriptional responses suggest a functional role of the microbiome in inducing Treg development in MS patients after PA therapy.
To directly observe whether PA leads to an increase in Treg cell suppressive function, Treg cells were isolated from PBMCs of HCs and cultivated for 5 days in the presence or absence of PA. Harvested cells were then added to the aforementioned suppression assay, and proliferation of PBMCs was measured in coculture with or without PA-treated Treg cells. As expected, PA treatment increased the suppressive capacity of Treg cells in vitro ( Figures 3 E and 3F).
In the ex vivo suppression assay ( Figures 1 L and 1M), cytokine amounts in the supernatant of cells isolated from PA-treated patients indicated a shift in the underlying inflammatory profile. The MS and de novo MS groups exhibited a significant increase in interleukin-10 (IL-10) after PA treatment ( Figures 4 A and 4B). IL-17 and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) were decreased significantly in the MS group (initial mixed cohort), but IL-17 was not altered significantly in the de novo MS group ( Figures S4 C–S4F). Indeed, the suppressive capacity correlated significantly with IL-10 amounts, accounting for about 20% of the observed effect ( Figure S4 G).
To investigate the connection between cytokines and immune cell function, we assayed whether the PA-induced increase in Treg suppression of PBMC proliferation requires the presence of IL-10. Treg cells from de novo diagnosed MS patients at baseline and on day 14 were isolated, and the suppression assay was performed as described previously, with inclusion of an anti-IL-10 antibody. Suppression of IL-10 on day 14 prevented the increase in suppressive capacity after PA administration ( Figure 4 C), whereas there was no difference at baseline. This result confirms the necessity of IL-10 for PA modulation of Treg cell functionality.
Cell metabolism plays an important role in the function of various immune cells ( Mills et al., 2017; Brunet-Ratnasingham et al., 2019 6. Brunet-Ratnasingham, E. ∙ Dubé, M. ∙ Kaufmann, D.E. Targeting Mitochondria to Revive Dysfunctional Regulatory T Cells Trends Mol. Med. 2019; 25 :1-3 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar 41. Mills, E.L. ∙ Kelly, B. ∙ O’Neill, L.A.J. Mitochondria are the powerhouses of immunity Nat. Immunol. 2017; 18 :488-498 Crossref Scopus (688) PubMed Google Scholar ). To ascertain the underlying mechanism of the observed increase in Treg cell suppressive capacity and IL-10 production, we measured the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in isolated Treg cells from MS patients before and after PA supplementation. At baseline, MS patients showed diminished maximal respiration compared with HCs ( Figures 4 F and 4G). Long-term dietary supplementation with PA (day 90) increased the OCR of MS Treg cells. Interestingly, we observed that HCs had an OCR similar to MS patients on day 90, demonstrating that long-term dietary intervention with PA is able to restore mitochondrial respiration in Treg cells of MS patients to that of HCs (see example plot in Figure 4 D and experimental data in Figure 4 E). Basal and maximal respiration of MS patients also increased significantly after 90 days of PA supplementation (see example plot in Figure 4 D and experimental data in Figures 4 E–4G).
To test whether the increase in mitochondrial respiration after long-term PA supplementation is caused by an increase in mitochondrial mass, we quantified the volume and number of mitochondria per Treg cell. We found no difference in these parameters between day 0 and day 90 (data not shown). When we analyzed the mitochondrial morphology in more detail, we observed a trend of altered mitochondrial morphology in MS on day 0 compared with HCs. MS mitochondria exhibit a higher ellipsoid length and lower sphericity than HC mitochondria. After 3 months of PA supplementation in MS patients, MS mitochondrial morphology showed a trend toward a more spherical and less ellipsoid shape compared with day 0 ( Figures 4 H–4J; Video S1 ). Strikingly, the mitochondrial morphology in Treg cells from day 90 MS patients was similar to that of HCs, suggesting that MS Treg cell mitochondria are not only functionally impaired but also display an altered morphological phenotype that can be reversed by long-term dietary supplementation with PA. These findings support the notion that mitochondrial function and integrity play a role in the pathogenesis of MS.

To elucidate the underlying mechanism of enhanced Treg cell suppressive capacity in MS patients after PA, gene expression in peripheral blood cells of MS patients was analyzed before and after PA supplementation. We found 585 significantly regulated genes, including 517 upregulated and 68 downregulated genes. Pathway analysis revealed mainly T cell-specific gene regulation ( Figure 5 A). Other upregulated genes were involved in the nucleotide excision repair pathway ( Figure S5 A). Additionally, after 2 weeks of PA treatment, we observed an upregulation of inducible co-stimulator-inducible co-stimulator ligand (iCOS-iCOSL) signaling in Th cells ( Figure S5 B) and in T cell receptor signaling ( Figure S5 C) with upregulation of CD28 , IL-2R , CD3e , iCOS , and NFAT , all known T cell activation-associated genes. Based on the most regulated pathways for T cell activation and in the context of increased Treg numbers and function, network connectivity analysis revealed IL-10 and TNF as two major gene interaction hubs after PA supplementation ( Figure 5 B), indicating their potential biological importance in coordinating cellular response to PA treatment.
We found several mitochondrion-related genes to be altered after PA supplementation that met our cutoff of differentially expressed genes with p < 0.01, false discovery rate (FDR) of less than 0.05, and less than 2-fold change. These include, among others, CROT (logFC = 0.4, p = 0.0007282), which encodes carnitine O-octanoyltransferase. Its function in transesterification affects transport of acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) from peroxisomes to mitochondria. Acyl-CoA is involved in β-oxidation, which has the main function of fatty acid degradation but also results in production of acetyl-CoA, which, in turn, is used for ATP production within the citric acid cycle ( Westin et al., 2008 56. Westin, M.A.K. ∙ Hunt, M.C. ∙ Alexson, S.E.H.

Life Sci. 2008; 65 :982-990 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ). XPA (logFC = 0.3468, p = 0.0046573), another gene found to be upregulated after PA intake, plays an important role in mitophagy ( Fang et al., 2014 18.

Expression of CMC1 (logFC = 0.301029996, p = 0,0056271), which has been shown previously to be involved in mitochondrial respiratory chain complex IV assembly, was also increased on day 14 ( Bourens and Barrientos, 2017 5. Bourens, M. ∙ Barrientos, A. A CMC1 -knockout reveals translation-independent control of human mitochondrial complex IV biogenesis EMBO Rep. 2017; 18 :477-494 Crossref Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ). These alterations in gene expression point to increased metabolism in MS patients after PA supplementation. This is in line with our previous experiment revealing increased mitochondrial respiration of Treg cells after long-term PA administration.

Section: Discussion

Our study provides further evidence of the hypothesis that SCFAs are reduced in autoimmune diseases, such as MS, as a consequence of an altered gut microbiome. This decreased presence of SCFAs leads to reduced Treg cell function, which might be reversed by supplementation of SCFAs such as PA. Besides beneficial immunomodulatory effects, oral PA supplementation might also have a neuroprotective effect, as suggested by higher availability of PA in the CSF, altered deep gray matter structure, and improved clinical outcomes. Decreased PA amounts in the serum and stool of MS patients, accompanied by reduced Treg cell numbers and function, could be a contributing factor that promotes accumulation of neurodegeneration over the course of the disease.
Although there is increasing evidence of the association of an altered gut microbiome with the pathogenesis of chronic diseases such as MS, it is becoming increasingly clear that dysbiosis of the gut microbiome rather than pathobionts might be crucially involved in the immunopathogenesis of MS ( Manfredo et al., 2018 37. Manfredo, V.S. ∙ Hiltensperger, M. ∙ Kumar, V. ... Translocation of a gut pathobiont drives autoimmunity in mice and humans Science. 2018; 359 :1156-1161 Crossref Scopus (593) PubMed Google Scholar ). In our study, we identified altered gut microbiome composition and resulting SCFA metabolites in MS patients that could be rectified by oral treatment of PA. Further, we have shown how this treatment ameliorates the disease course, possibly (or at least partially) through PA’s induction of Treg cell suppressive function through gut-immune interactions. This mechanism was also found to rely on IL-10 presence and also involves alteration of immune cell mitochondrial function.
Interestingly, in our cohort, the microbiome composition of MS patients not only differed from that of HCs, but also varied according to their disease course, but whether this variation is causative or a result of the disease has yet to be determined. These findings were reflected by reduced amounts of PA in patient serum and stool. Our initial observation of MS subjects, accounting for immunomodulatory treatment and subtype heterogeneity, revealed a perturbed microbiome involving depletion of some SCFA producers ( Butyricimonas ), enrichment of some pathobionts ( Flavonifractor and Escherichia/Shigella ), and taxa that bloom under low-SCFA conditions ( Collinsella ) ( Göker et al., 2011; Louis and Flint, 2009; Sakamoto et al., 2009 21. Göker, M. ∙ Gronow, S. ∙ Zeytun, A. ... Complete genome sequence of Odoribacter splanchnicus type strain Stand Genomic Sci. 2011; 4 :200-209 Crossref Scopus (84) PubMed Google Scholar 33.

These findings were reflected by reduced amounts of serum and stool PA in all patients. This decrease was even more pronounced in therapy-naive subjects with newly diagnosed MS, indicating that alterations in the gut microbiome might affect the severity of MS and that successful interventions might involve restoration of gut homeostasis. Intriguingly, microbiome changes of PA-responding patients led to functional changes (i.e., increased Treg cell-inducing genes in the intestinal organ culture system; Yissachar et al., 2017 57. Yissachar, N. ∙ Zhou, Y. ∙ Ung, L. ... An Intestinal Organ Culture System Uncovers a Role for the Nervous System in Microbe-Immune Crosstalk Cell. 2017; 168 :1135-1148.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (185) PubMed Google Scholar ) as opposed to patients who did not respond to PA.
We also investigated the direct immunological and clinical changes under oral PA supplementation in a translational proof-of-concept study. PA supplementation induced a positive shift in immune cell balance (i.e., a decrease in Th1/Th17 and an increase in peripheral Treg cells and functional recovery of Treg cell suppressive function) in MS patients. We did not observe any relevant adverse events under PA. This effect of PA on Treg and Th1/Th17 cells was validated in an independent cohort consisting of therapy-naive subjects with newly diagnosed MS ( de novo cohort) as well as in subjects with rheumatoid arthritis. In vitro , the functional recovery induced by PA treatment required anti-inflammatory IL-10, a key Treg cell cytokine also found by network connectivity analyses to be a central hub gene. Moreover, PA supplementation normalized Treg cell mitochondrial respiration and morphology from a basal altered state in MS.
With clinical, ex vivo , and in vitro data, this study is the first to provide such insights into the immunomodulatory and metabolic capabilities of PA in the context of MS. The effect of PA on regulatory immune function abuts a growing body of evidence implicating reduced Treg cell function as a causative factor of autoimmune disorders ( Ledford, 2017 30. Ledford, H. Drug companies flock to supercharge T-cells in fight against autoimmune disease Nature. 2017; Published online August 2, 2017 Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar ). Furthermore, our observation aligns with recent literature suggesting that reduced SCFA production in the gut, whether as a result of an altered diet and/or reduced production by gut bacteria, leads to impairment in Treg cell function. This has not only been shown in animal models of autoimmune diseases such as MS, inflammatory bowel disease, and type-1 diabetes but also of metabolic disorders ( Haghikia et al., 2013, 2015; Smith et al., 2013; Sonnenburg and Bäckhed, 2016 23. Haghikia, A. ∙ Hohlfeld, R. ∙ Gold, R. ... Therapies for multiple sclerosis: translational achievements and outstanding needs Trends Mol.

The microbial metabolites, short-chain fatty acids, regulate colonic Treg cell homeostasis Science. 2013; 341 :569-573 Crossref Scopus (3857) PubMed Google Scholar 53. Sonnenburg, J.L. ∙ Bäckhed, F. Diet-microbiota interactions as moderators of human metabolism Nature. 2016; 535 :56-64 Crossref Scopus (1526) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this context, although our observation of decreased suppressive Treg cell function in MS patients is unsurprising, its improvement (alongside positive clinical outcomes) by supplementary PA treatment represents a novel application of a microbiota-derived metabolite.
This improved Treg cell function correlates with alleviation of clinical symptoms in MS patients. In a retrospective setting, we observed a decrease in relapse rate and stabilization of disability during long-term PA supplementation. To evaluate neural tissue damage more objectively, we performed brain MRI scans in a small subset of patients from this cohort. Analysis of these revealed an increase in gray matter volume in the basal ganglia, although no changes in lesion load were observed. Lack of changes in lesion presence is probably due to low overall MRI inflammatory activity in this cohort of patients receiving ongoing immunomodulatory treatments. Thus, we suspect that PA might elicit neuroprotective effects beyond immune modulation. Despite our small sample sizes, these findings are highly suggestive, but future studies are required to make conclusive claims. Taken together, these results demonstrate that mechanisms improving Treg cell numbers and functionality as well as a simultaneous decrease in Th17 cell count in MS patients, are correlated with the apparently immune-independent prevention of neurodegeneration in MS patients.
The underlying pathway leading to direct neuroprotection by PA still remains to be elucidated. In different models investigating neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Parkinson’s disease or Alzheimer’s disease), SCFA derivatives are thought to act as neuroprotective and/or neuromodulating agents through epigenetic modulation ( Kim et al., 2009; Sampson et al., 2016 26. Kim, H.J. ∙ Leeds, P. ∙ Chuang, D.M. The HDAC inhibitor, sodium butyrate, stimulates neurogenesis in the ischemic brain J. Neurochem. 2009; 110 :1226-1240 Crossref Scopus (265) PubMed Google Scholar 48. Sampson, T.R. ∙ Debelius, J.W. ∙ Thron, T. ... Gut Microbiota Regulate Motor Deficits and Neuroinflammation in a Model of Parkinson’s Disease Cell. 2016; 167 :1469-1480.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2368) PubMed Google Scholar ). There, they are regarded to function as histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) by inhibiting class I and II deacetylases ( Davie, 2003 13. Davie, J.R. Inhibition of histone deacetylase activity by butyrate J. Nutr. 2003; 133 :2485S-2493S Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). HDACs themselves mediate the removal of acetyl groups from lysine residues of the chromatin structure, resulting in transcription repression. Because imbalances in protein acetylation are associated with neurodegenerative conditions, HDACis are considered to manipulate neurodegeneration and -regeneration by intervening in cell metabolism or cell signaling. However, the exact underlying pathway has yet to be investigated ( Chuang et al., 2009; Choudhary et al., 2014 10. Choudhary, C. ∙ Weinert, B.T. ∙ Nishida, Y. ... The growing landscape of lysine acetylation links metabolism and cell signalling Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2014; 15 :536-550 Crossref Scopus (1029) PubMed Google Scholar 11.

Multiple roles of HDAC inhibition in neurodegenerative conditions Trends Neurosci. 2009; 32 :591-601 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (550) PubMed Google Scholar ).
In summary, our study, which included roughly 300 subjects with MS, revealed a dysbiotic gut microbiome alongside PA deficiency. PA supplementation had a beneficial effect on immunological, neurodegenerative, and clinical parameters in MS patients, including relapse rate and disability progression. The results of our proof-of-concept study reveal not only that purified PA supplementation is a safe add-on to existing immune-modulating drugs but also confirm that one mode of action of this supplemental treatment is because of stimulation of Treg cells. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show clinical effects and direct neuroregenerative effects of PA, linking the gut metabolome to the brain-immune axis. These retrospective results provide solid groundwork for prospective clinical phase II trials for supplemental PA treatment not only in MS but also for other autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis.

This study was approved by the ethics committee of the Department of Medicine at the Ruhr-University Bochum (registration number 15-5351, 4493-12, 17-6235) and the Department of Medicine Erlangen (registration number 357_17B). Prior to study participation, all participants signed informed consent forms. MS patients were diagnosed according to the 2017 McDonald criteria, and oligoclonal bands in the CSF were determined in all patients. Healthy volunteers and MS patients were instructed to supplement 500 mg sodium-propionate (PA) capsules twice daily for 14 days (PA; Flexopharm, Herne, Germany). Newly diagnosed ( de novo ) subjects with MS received PA directly after the confirmation of MS diagnosis for 14 days without additional medication. Following this individual MS treatment was initialized. Patients were seen at the outpatient clinics every 3-6 months, and assessed for relapses, new neurological symptoms, or disability progression (as rated by EDSS). Neurologic examination was performed by experienced, Neurostatus C certified neurologists. The study was sufficiently powered with an effect size of 0.28 (power calculation with the primary endpoint being increase of Treg) and α error of 0.05 reaching an actual power of 85 %. The validation cohort consisting of 36 de novo patients was statistically calculated (power calculation) with Wilcoxon signed-rank test consisting of an effect size of 0.5 (based on data from the previous cohort) and α error 0.05 with an actual power of 90%. Clinical data for retrospective analysis was assessed at the Department of Neurology of the Ruhr-University Bochum, at St. Josef-Hospital Bochum. Data assessment and statistical analysis were performed with SPSS. Statistical analysis for ARR was conducted by two-sided paired t test and by Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test.
Blood and fecal sample collection was performed at the Department of Neurology of the Ruhr-University Bochum, at the St. Josef-Hospital Bochum, and at the Clinic of Neurology II in EVK Hattingen. For immunophenotyping and suppression/proliferation assays, blood drawn (in EDTA tubes) was processed immediately after collection. Serum and stool samples taken at the same time points were immediately frozen at −80°C for future analysis. Also PBMC and Treg were alive frozen 1° per min until −80°C in RPMI1640 (GIBCO) containing 5% DMSO and 10 % FCS (both Sigma Aldrich) for later experiments.
For the serum sample preparation a modification of the method by McArthur and Sarnaik (1982) 39. McArthur, B. ∙ Sarnaik, A.P. Quantification of short-chain fatty acids in plasma Clin. Chem. 1982; 28 :1983-1984 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar was used. 200 μl plasma and 20 μl internal standard (130 μM ethyl butyrate) were mixed. 200 μl of the mixture were added to 10 μl of 70 % perchloric acid and 20 μl of 2 M hydrochloric acid, and this mixture was extracted with 1 mL cold diethyl ether. After phase separation 800 μl of the organic layer were given to 7.5 μl of 4 M sodium hydroxide and vortex mixed. The sample was dried in a stream of nitrogen, first at room temperature and finally at 60°C. The residue was solved in 20 μl of 2 M hydrochloric acid and diluted to a volume of 400 μl with isopropanol. After centrifugation at 200 x g for 3 min the propionic acid was analyzed by a gas chromatograph (GC-2010, Shimadzu, Germany) fitted with a DB-FFAP capillary column (15-3262, 60 m × 0.53 mm i.d.; Agilent Technologies, Germany) and a flame ionization detector.
For extraction of propionic acid from CSF ( McArthur and Sarnaik, 1982 39. McArthur, B. ∙ Sarnaik, A.P. Quantification of short-chain fatty acids in plasma Clin. Chem. 1982; 28 :1983-1984 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ) 50 μl sample were added to 5 μl of d3-propionic acid (EQ Laboratories, Augsburg, Germany, 300 μM in 10 mM NaOH), mixed and incubated for 5 min at 8°C. 50 μl of this mixture were given to 50 μl of 1 M perchloric acid and mixed gently. 1 mL wet diethyl ether was added immediately, and for the extraction the samples were shaken for 1 min at 15 Hz (MM 400, Retsch, Haan, Germany). After centrifugation for phase separation (200 x g, 5 min) 800 μl of the diethyl ether phase were added to 10 μl of 1 M NaOH, mixed and the ether was evaporated in a stream of nitrogen at room temperature.

Anal. 2017; 138 :43-53 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar . The residue of the extraction was neutralized using 15 μl of 0.45 M phosphoric acid and 15 μl of 1 M phosphate buffer (pH 6). After addition of 10 μl of N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N’-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (0.5 M, Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany) and 5 μl of glycine ethyl ester hydrochloride (1.3 M, Sigma) an incubation of 1.5 h at room temperature followed. The carbodiimid was quenched by the addition of 10 μl of DTT (0.5 M) and 15 μl of tartrate (0.36 M). The reaction mixture was extracted by 500 μl diethyl ether and an aliquot of 300 μl of the organic phase was evaporated as described above. The residue was solved in 20 μl of methanol + water (1+1) for LC-MS/MS analysis.
For HPLC-MS/MS measurements an Agilent 1100 HPLC equipped with a Poroshell HPH-C18 column (150 mm x 2.1 mm, 4 μm) from Agilent Technologies (Waldbronn, Germany) and an API 2000 (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany) were used. The elution was done at 42°C using a gradient of methanol + 10 mM of ammonium formate pH 8 (20 + 80), methanol + water + formic acid (80 + 20 + 0.1), and methanol. Post column the eluent was acidified by methanol + water + formic acid (180 + 20 + 0.4). The mass transitions were 160.1/114.1 and 163.2/117.2 m/z for propionic acid and the deuterated internal standard, respectively. Statistical analysis was performed with Graphpad Prism (v6; two-tailed Mann-Whitney test).
SCFA in the fecal samples were analyzed as described by Furusawa et al. (2013) 19. Furusawa, Y. ∙ Obata, Y. ∙ Fukuda, S. ... Commensal microbe-derived butyrate induces the differentiation of colonic regulatory T cells Nature. 2013; 504 :446-450 Crossref Scopus (3746) PubMed Google Scholar with modifications. Briefly 10 mg of fecal samples were homogenized using 2.8 mm Precellys ceramic beads (Bertin Technologies) with extraction solution containing 100 mL of 100 mM crotonic acid (Sigma) as internal standard, 50 mL HCl (Sigma) and 200 mL ether (Sigma). Samples were homogenized 10 min at room temperature at 1500 rpm on a shaker (Eppendorf) and followed by 10 min of centrifugation at 1000 x g. From the ether upper phase 80 mL were transferred into new glass vials containing 16 mL N-tert-butyldimethylsilyl-N-methyltrifluoroacetamide (MTBSTFA, Sigma). Samples were incubated for 20 min at 80°C shaken at 500 rpm on a shaker (Eppendorf) and left afterward at room temperature for 24 h for derivatization. Statistical analysis was performed with Graphpad Prism (v6; two-tailed Mann-Whitney test).
Stool was collected by a trained nurse and samples were frozen immediately (−80°C). For extraction of DNA a commercial system (QIAamp Fast Stool Mini Kit, QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) was used. In brief, the samples were thawed at 4°C and approximately 500 mg were suspended in Inhibitex buffer (3ml). Suspensions were heated (95°C, 5min), spinned (20,000 x g) and the supernatant was used for DNA preparation according to the protocol of the manufacturer.
Purity was checked by determining the OD260/OD280 ratio, damage, and degradation by agarose gel electrophoresis and absence of inhibitors was verified by amplification with the primers 27F and 534R, which amplify the V1-V3 regions of bacterial DNA. The 16S rDNA region was amplified with the same primers and sequenced by Illumina technology by a commercial vendor (GATC Biotech, Konstanz, Germany).
The 16S rDNA sequencing data were analyzed using the R based DADA2 package ( Callahan et al., 2015 7. Callahan, B.J. ∙ Mcmurdie, P.J. ∙ Rosen, M.J. ... DADA2: High resolution sample inference from amplicon data Nat. Methods. 2015; 13 :581-583 Crossref Scopus (17054) Google Scholar ). Only reads without ambiguous bases and with exact primer match were used. The primer sequence were removed using cutadapt ( Martin, 2011 38. Martin, M. Cutadapt removes adapter sequences from high-throughput sequencing reads EMBnet.journal. 2011; 17 :10-12 Crossref Google Scholar ) and the reads were truncated to 290bp (fwd) and 250bp (rev) and filtered using DADA2′s recommended expected error threshold of 2. The sequencing error rates were modeled, and the filtered reads were dereplicated and amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were inferred. Chimeras were removed and taxonomy was assigned against the SILVA database v132 ( Quast et al., 2013 44. Quast, C. ∙ Pruesse, E. ∙ Yilmaz, P. ... The SILVA ribosomal RNA gene database project: improved data processing and web-based tools Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41 :D590-D596 Crossref Scopus (19331) PubMed Google Scholar ) with minimum bootstrap confidence of 80 using the RDP Naive Bayesian Classifier algorithm ( Wang et al., 2007 55. Wang, Q. ∙ Garrity, G.M. ∙ Tiedje, J.M. ... Naive Bayesian classifier for rapid assignment of rRNA sequences into the new bacterial taxonomy Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2007; 73 :5261-5267 Crossref Scopus (15417) PubMed Google Scholar ) implemented in DADA2.
Downstream analysis was based on rarified (using RTK [ Saary et al., 2017 46. Saary, P. ∙ Forslund, K. ∙ Bork, P. ... RTK: efficient rarefaction analysis of large datasets Bioinformatics. 2017; 33 :2594-2595 Crossref Scopus (77) PubMed Google Scholar ] with default parameters) data and performed in R version 3.3. Comparison of compositional differences between the groups was analyzed with PERMANOVA test (ADONIS) on weighted and unweighted UniFrac distances. Comparison of alpha diversity between MS types were analyzed with Wilcoxon signed-rank test with Bonferroni adjustment (n = 3) including all time points using time point as the blocking factor. Identification of differential abundant bacteria was performed using MetagenomeSeq ( Paulson et al., 2013 43. Paulson, J.N. ∙ Stine, O.C. ∙ Bravo, H.C. ... Differential abundance analysis for microbial marker-gene surveys Nat. Methods. 2013; 10 :1200-1202 Crossref Scopus (1511) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To assess whether gut microbial abundances differ between HC and MS, rarefied (using RTK [ Saary et al., 2017 46. Saary, P. ∙ Forslund, K. ∙ Bork, P. ... RTK: efficient rarefaction analysis of large datasets Bioinformatics. 2017; 33 :2594-2595 Crossref Scopus (77) PubMed Google Scholar ] with default parameters) abundances were compared using a Mann-Whitney U-test implemented in R. To rule out confounding influence from immunotherapy (interferone n = 5, dimethylfumarate n = 5, glatirameracetate n = 3, fingolimod n = 1), additionally a test was conducted using comparing nested linear models of rank-transformed abundances as a function of treatment status plus disease status, compared to a model omitting the tested variable, under a likelihood ratio test, using the R lmtest package. Both tests were Benjamini-Hochberg FDR adjusted per taxonomic level, and FDR < 0.1 for both tests required to conclude significance. Effect of subtype was tested identically restricting MS samples to each subtype in turn (SPMS, RRMS, PPMS), and effects of drugs tested using MS samples only, controlling for each other drug than the one tested. Effect sizes were computed using Cliff’s delta nonparametric directional measures as implemented in the orddom R package. This analysis constitutes a beta version of a tool currently under development (Birkner et al., manuscript in preparation ).
Whole blood cells of MS and HC at different time points were stained by BD Multitest 6-Color TBNK (αCD3-FITC; αCD16-PE + αCD56-PE; αCD45-PerCP Cy5.5; αCD4-PE Cy7; αCD19-APC; αCD8-APC Cy7; BD). T cell subsets were identified with αCD196 (CCR6)-PerCP Cy5.5 (11A9; BD), αCD4-FITC (RPA-T4; BD), αCD161-PE (DX-12; BD) and αCD183 (CXCR3)-APC (1C6/CXCR3; BD) for determination of Th1 and Th17 as previously described ( Maecker et al., 2012 36. Maecker, H.T. ∙ McCoy, J.P. ∙ Nussenblatt, R. Standardizing immunophenotyping for the Human Immunology Project Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2012; 12 :191-200 Crossref Scopus (820) PubMed Google Scholar ). As an internal control, we assessed Th1 and Th17 with intracellular markers for IFNγ as well as IL-17 (BD Bioscience). For Treg analysis, cells were stained with CD4-FITC (RPA-T4, eBioscience) and CD25-APC (BC96, eBioscience) and intracellular FoxP3-PE (236A/E7, eBioscience) by using Foxp3/Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Set (eBioscience) according to manufacturer protocol. Phenotyping was performed on BD FACS Canto2 and analyzed by BD FACS DIVA v6 or BD FACS CANTO2 software. Statistical analysis was performed with Graphpad Prism (v6; two-tailed Mann-Whitney test was applied for inter-group analysis and two-tailed paired t test for intra-individual analysis).
PBMC from whole blood of healthy volunteers and MS patients were isolated by Ficoll Paque PLUS (GE Healthcare) gradient centrifugation and separated via MACS CD4 + CD25 + CD127 dim/− Regulatory T Cell Isolation Kit II human (Miltenyi Biotec) according to manufacturer protocol. Briefly, CD127 dim/− cells were negatively isolated from all collected PBMC and were subsequently subjected to positive selection of CD25 + for regulatory T cells. CD127 + as well as CD25 − cells were pooled at the end of the procedure and used as control cells (PBMC − ); approximately 2 million PBMC − were stained with CellTrace CFSE Cell Proliferation Kit (Thermo Scientific) to investigate proliferation in a mixed lymphocyte reaction. Cells were seeded, 50,000 cells per well in duplicates, in serum free-LGM3 medium (Lonza) or x-vivo 15 medium (Biozym) on 96-well plates. Treg, as well as unstained PBMC − , were seeded on a 1:2 or 1:1 ratio with CFSE stained PBMC − . As a reference stain for autologous proliferation of CFSE stained cells, PBMC − were seeded separately, sans coculture. For IL-10 blocking experiments, IL-10 neutralizing antibody (biolegend) was added at 30 ng/ml to the coculture. All assays were cultured at 37°C with 5% CO 2 for 5 days. Proliferation was analyzed by flow cytometry whereby dead cells were excluded by Fixable Viability Dye eFluor® 780 (eBioscience). Statistical analysis was performed with Graphpad Prism (v6; two-tailed Mann-Whitney test was applied for inter-group analysis and two-tailed paired t test for intra-individual analysis)
22 MS patients treated with PA (SCFA) received 1.5 T MRI investigation at baseline and follow-up investigation at a mean time interval of 1.5 years. This PA group was compared to 22 MS patients without orally applied SCFAs (NON-SCFA) matched one-by-one to the SCFA group for age, sex, and disease-type, who also received 1.5 T MRI at baseline and follow-up after 1.5 years.
MR imaging included sagittal high-resolution 3D-T1w for volumetry and FLAIR sequences for lesion detection and lesion filling purposes. The MRI scans were acquired in a single center either on a Siemens Symphony 1.5 T Scanner or a Siemens Avanto 1.5 T Scanner between 2012 and 2018. On both scanners a fixed, standardized imaging protocol was used with similar parameters of the 3D-T1w series (magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo sequence; echo time: 3.93 ms, repetition time: 1900 ms, inversion time: 1100 ms, flip angle: 15°, number of excitations: 1, resolution: 1 mm x 1 mm x 1.5 mm, matrix: 256 × 256, 128 slices). For FLAIR imaging axial slices were used on the Symphony scanner (repetition time/echo time/inversion time: 9000 ms / 117 ms / 2500 ms, flip angle 160°, number of excitations:1, resolution 1 mm x 1 mm x 5 mm, gap 10%, matrix: 256 × 192, 28 slices), while sagittal 3D FLAIR imaging was used on the Avanto Scanner. (repetition time/echo time/inversion time: 6000 ms / 305 ms / 2100 ms, flip angle 120°, number of excitations: 1, resolution 1 mm x 1 mm x 1 mm, matrix: 256 × 256, 140 slices).
Before volumetric preprocessing hypointense MS lesions on T1 contrast were filled using LST toolbox. Lesions were segmented by the lesion prediction algorithm (Schmidt, 2017, Chapter 6.1) as implemented in the LST toolbox version 2.0.15 (available at https://www.statistical-modelling.de/lst.html ) for SPM. In this software the MS lesions were automatically segmented on the FLAIR images. The hypointense lesions on the coregistered, associated T1w images were filled with the intensity of healthy white matter on the basis of the segmented FLAIR lesion maps. Total brain lesion loads of the two MRI time points were compared using the longitudinal pipeline implemented in the LST toolbox.
The lesion-filled 3D-T1-weighted series were processed for voxel-based statistics (and region based morphometry including an atlas based region-of-interest analysis) using the longitudinal preprocessing pipeline of CAT12 (Computational Anatomy Toolbox version R1165, available at http://www.neuro.uni-jena.de/cat/ ). This fully automated toolbox provides spatial registration to a reference brain template in MNI-space, segmentation and tissue classification in gray and white matter, bias correction for image intensity variations and modulation as prerequisites for voxel based morphometry and other morphometric techniques. The gray and white matter probability maps were smoothed with an 8x8 mm Gaussian kernel and used for further voxel-based morphometric statistical analyses (VBM).
A flexible factorial design was used as the basic statistical model in CAT12 including subject, group (SCFA or non-SCFA) and time (scan 1 or scan 2) as factors to account for repeated-measures in two patient groups. Age and sex were included as covariates of no interest, while the intracranial volume was treated as a global effect using global normalization. Non-parametric permutation-based threshold free cluster enhancement (TFCE) was applied to the resulting T-maps of the investigated contrasts (longitudinal decrease or increase of GM or WM in both patient groups) to improve the statistical power. In TFCE the Draper-Stoneman approach (extent E = 0.5, height H = 2.0) for permutation of the time variable was used, while keeping the nuisance variables constant. For the investigation of the basal ganglia and thalamus a small volume correction was applied using a mask of radius 40 mm. Because of the exploratory character of the morphometric assessments we reported uncorrected results with p ≤ 0.05.
Fecal samples of MS patients before and after PA intake (200-300 mg) were resuspended in 1ml of sterile PBS. For aerobic cultures, serial dilutions were plated on standard LB plates and incubated at 37°C for 24h. For anaerobic cultures, serial dilutions were plated on BHI rich medium plates, and incubated in an anaerobic chamber (Don Whitley Scientific) at 37°C, for two days. Bacterial colonies were then counted to calculate bacterial load (CFU/ gr).
Gut organ culture experiments were performed as previously described ( Yissachar et al., 2017 57. Yissachar, N. ∙ Zhou, Y. ∙ Ung, L. ... An Intestinal Organ Culture System Uncovers a Role for the Nervous System in Microbe-Immune Crosstalk Cell. 2017; 168 :1135-1148.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (185) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, colons from C57/BL6 SPF mice aged 12-14 days were placed in the gut organ culture device (6 colons in each experiment) and connected to the gut organ culture system to control luminal flow, external medium flow, temperature, humidity and O 2 /CO 2 levels.
Patients’ fecal samples were diluted in sterile organ culture medium (20% KnockOut serum replacement, 2% B-27, 1% N-2, 1% L-glutamine, 1% non- essential amino acids, and 1% HEPES in IMDM) to a bacterial concentration of 10 7 CFU/ml. Fecal suspension was left to stand for 1 min to allow sedimentation of solids, the supernatant was collected into the input syringes and loaded on the gut culture syringe pumps. Each gut organ culture experiment included 6 colons dissected from littermate mice, infused with microbiota derived from one patient before and after treatment, in triplicates. Tissues were collected for analysis at 2h post-colonization.
Colon tissue fragments (3 mm) were stored in RNAlater overnight at 4°C, homogenized using a bead beater, and bulk RNA was extracted (using RNeasy Plus Universal Mini QIAGEN kit). The Illumina TruSeq stranded mRNA library prep kit (#20020594) was used for library generation, and next generation sequencing was performed in the Bar-Ilan University scientific equipment center using the Illumina NextSeq platform (NextSeq 500 High Output v2 kit (#FC-404-2005)). RNA sequencing data were analyzed at the Nancy and Stephen Grand Israel National Center for Personalized Medicine, Weizmann Institute of Science. Briefly, Poly-A/T stretches and Illumina adapters were trimmed from the reads using cutadapt; resulting reads shorter than 30bp were discarded. Reads were mapped to the M. musculus reference genome GRCm38 using STAR, supplied with gene annotations downloaded from Ensembl (and with EndToEnd option and outFilterMismatchNoverLmax was set to 0.04). Expression levels for each gene were quantified using htseq-count, using the gtf above. Differentially expressed genes were identified using DESeq2 ( Love et al., 2014 34. Love, M.I. ∙ Huber, W. ∙ Anders, S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2 Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :550 Crossref Scopus (48468) PubMed Google Scholar ) with the betaPrior, cooksCutoff and independent Filtering parameters set to False. Raw p values were adjusted for multiple testing using the procedure of Benjamini and Hochberg. Pipeline was run using snakemake. All data are available for the accession number for microarray raw data GEO: GSE142748 .
PBMC as well as isolated Treg from MS patients and HC were thawed, counted, and seeded at 1 mio cells/ml x-vivo 15 medium in 48 well plates. Both cell types were stimulated for proliferation by 10 ng/ml rIL2 (Immunotools) and Treg were additionally restimulated with 3 μg αCD3 and 1 μg αCD28 (both Thermo Fisher) on day 1 of culture. Medium change and cell splitting was done any other day starting on day 2. In vitro expansion was performed for 6 days before PA treatment. Expanded PBMC and Treg were harvested on day 6 of culture, counted, and subsequently reseeded at 1 mio/ml x-vivo 15 medium containing before mentioned stimuli and additionally 150 μM PA or A.dest as control. In vitro treatment was performed for 5 days with medium exchange any other day starting on day 2. Cells were harvested afterward and used in suppression assay as described before.
Cytokine levels, i.e., IL-17 and IFNγ, and IL-10, suppression assay supernatants were measured in triplicates, using ELISA Duo Kits (R&D Systems) following manufacturer’s protocol. Results were tested for statistical significance by paired t test for intra-group and two-sided Mann-Whitney test for inter-individual analysis using Graphpad Prism (v6).
Frozen Treg were thawed and seeded on sterile poly-D-lysine coated 96-well Agilent Seahorse XF Cell Culture Microplate at a density of 5 × 10 5 cells per well. Cells were incubated at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO 2 and 95% air atmosphere in x-vivo 15 (Biozym) for 24h. Sensor cartridges were hydrated in Seahorse XF Calibrant at 37°C in a non-CO 2 incubator overnight. Cell medium was replaced by Seahorse medium (DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 2 mM sodium pyruvate (Sigma-Aldrich), 10 mM glucose (Sigma-Aldrich) and 2 mM L-glutamine (GIBCO®, ThermoFisher Scientific)) and cells were incubated at 37°C in a non-CO 2 incubator 1 h prior to measurement. The metabolic activities of the cells were measured using a Seahorse Bioscience XF96 Extracellular Flux Analyzer (Agilent Technologies). Cell Mito Stress Test was performed as described by Agilent Technologies. ATP synthase inhibitor Oligomycin (2 μM), mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation uncoupler FCCP (2 μM) and Antimycin A (complex III inhibitor)/Rotenone (complex I inhibitor and NADH oxidation inhibitor) (1 μM/0.5 μM) were injected to the cells sequentially (Agilent Technologies). Key parameters of mitochondrial function (basal respiration, maximal respiration) were calculated according to the Mito Stress Test protocol. For basal and maximal respiration two-tailed Mann-Whitney test for comparison between HC and MS d0 and RM one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test for comparison between MS d0, d14, and d90 was performed.
Treg were incubated in X-Vivo 15 medium supplemented with 2.5 μM CellTracker Green, 66 nM MitoTracker Red CMXRos and 1 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 for 20 min at 37°C. Subsequently, cells were washed with X-Vivo 15 medium and PBS followed by fixation in 4% PFA in PBS (pH 7.4). For imaging, the cells were resuspended in PBS (pH 7.4) in a 35 mm glass bottom μ-Dish (Ibidi, Germany). Images from 15 to 20 Treg per individual were acquired using a Zeiss ELYRA PS.1 equipped with an LSM 880. Specifically, 20 to 38 laser scanning microscopy z stacks at an interval of 514 nm were acquired by 405, 488 and 561 nm laser excitation at 9.36 μs pixel dwell time. For image analysis the surfaces of cells, nuclei, and mitochondria were reconstructed using Imaris 9.3.1 batch processing functionality. Data on mitochondrial surface, mean sphericity, and ellipsoid axis length C (longest axis) were extracted and plotted using Imaris 9.3.1 Vantage module and Graphpad Prism.
Sample preparation for microarray hybridization was carried out as described in the Affymetrix GeneChip WT PLUS Reagent Kit User Manual (Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA).
In brief, 200 ng of total RNA were used to generate double-stranded cDNA. 12 μg of subsequently synthesized cRNA were purified and reverse transcribed into sense-strand (ss) cDNA, whereat unnatural dUTP residues were incorporated. Purified ss cDNA was fragmented using a combination of uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG) and apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE 1) followed by a terminal labeling with biotin. 3.8 μg fragmented and labeled ss cDNA were hybridized to Affymetrix Clariom S human arrays for 16 h at 45°C in a GeneChip hybridization oven 640. Hybridized arrays were washed and stained in an Affymetrix Fluidics Station FS450, and the fluorescent signals were measured with an Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G. Fluidics and scan functions were controlled by Affymetrix GeneChip Command Console v4.1.3 software.
Sample processing was performed at an Affymetrix Service Provider and Core Facility, “KFB - Center of Excellence for Fluorescent Bioanalytics” (Regensburg, Germany; http://www.kfb-regensburg.de ).
Probe set signals were summarized and normalized using the CEL file import function in BRB Tools (Version 4.6.0 Beta2 developed by Dr. Richard Simon and the BRB-ArrayTools Development Team) and paired sample analysis was further performed using the Class Comparison Tool in BRB Tools. Genes deemed significant with a multiple testing adjusted p value of < 0.05.
Pathway analysis was performed using Ingenuity (IPA, QIAGEN GmbH Germany). All data are available for the accession number for microarray raw data GSE116835.
The SMARTer Ultra Low Input RNA Kit for Sequencing v4 (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA) was used to generate first strand cDNA from 1 ng total-RNA. Double stranded cDNA was amplified by LD PCR (11 cycles) and purified via magnetic bead clean-up. Library preparation was carried out as described in the Illumina Nextera XT Sample Preparation Guide (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). 150 pg of input cDNA were tagmented (tagged and fragmented) by the Nextera XT transposome. The products were purified and amplified via a limited-cycle PCR program to generate multiplexed sequencing libraries. For the PCR step 1:5 dilutions of index 1 (i7) and index 2 (i5) primers were used. The libraries were quantified using the KAPA SYBR FAST ABI Prism Library Quantification Kit (Kapa Biosystems, Inc., Woburn, MA, USA). Equimolar amounts of each library were pooled, and the pools were used for cluster generation on the cBot with the Illumina TruSeq SR Cluster Kit v3. The sequencing run was performed on a HiSeq 1000 instrument using the indexed, 50 cycles single-read (SR) protocol and the TruSeq SBS v3 Reagents according to the Illumina HiSeq 1000 System User Guide. Image analysis and base calling resulted in .bcl files, which were converted into .fastq files with the bcl2fastq v2.18 software.
Library preparation and RNaseq were performed at the Genomics Core Facility “KFB - Center of Excellence for Fluorescent Bioanalytics” (University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany; http://www.kfb-regensburg.de ).
Fastq Files were quality controlled using FastQC ( Andrews, 2010 1. Andrews, S. FastQC: A Quality Control Tool for High Throughput Sequence Data Babraham Bioinformatics, 2010 Google Scholar ) and reads were mapped to the GRCm38 mouse genome using the STAR aligner ( Dobin et al., 2013 14. Dobin, A. ∙ Davis, C.A. ∙ Schlesinger, F. ... STAR: ultrafast universal RNA-seq aligner Bioinformatics. 2013; 29 :15-21 Crossref Scopus (27072) PubMed Google Scholar ). Read counts were obtained by the featureCounts package ( Liao et al., 2014 32.
