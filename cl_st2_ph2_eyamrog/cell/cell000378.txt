Title: Fab-dimerized glycan-reactive antibodies are a structural category of natural antibodies


Abstract: Summary

Natural antibodies (Abs) can target host glycans on the surface of pathogens. We studied the evolution of glycan-reactive B cells of rhesus macaques and humans using glycosylated HIV-1 envelope (Env) as a model antigen. 2G12 is a broadly neutralizing Ab (bnAb) that targets a conserved glycan patch on Env of geographically diverse HIV-1 strains using a unique heavy-chain (V H ) domain-swapped architecture that results in fragment antigen-binding (Fab) dimerization. Here, we describe HIV-1 Env Fab-dimerized glycan (FDG)-reactive bnAbs without V H -swapped domains from simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV)-infected macaques. FDG Abs also recognized cell-surface glycans on diverse pathogens, including yeast and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike. FDG precursors were expanded by glycan-bearing immunogens in macaques and were abundant in HIV-1-naive humans. Moreover, FDG precursors were predominately mutated IgM + IgD + CD27 + , thus suggesting that they originated from a pool of antigen-experienced IgM + or marginal zone B cells.

Many pathogens, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) envelope (Env) ( Doores et al., 2010a 27. Doores, K.J. ∙ Bonomelli, C. ∙ Harvey, D.J. ...

Anti-glycan antibodies (Abs) constitute a subset of natural Abs that are present prior to stimulation by cognate antigen, can exist as different isotypes, and provide the first line of defense against bacterial, fungal, and viral infections ( Holodick et al., 2017 45. Holodick, N.E. ∙ Rodríguez-Zhurbenko, N. ∙ Hernández, A.M. Defining Natural Antibodies Front. Immunol. 2017; 8 :872 Crossref Scopus (76) PubMed Google Scholar ). In humans, natural Abs can be mutated either after antigen stimulation or by unknown processes as immunoglobulin M (IgM) Abs in the pre-immune B cell repertoire ( Holodick et al., 2017 45.

HIV-type 1 (HIV-1) Env is heavily glycosylated, thus Abs have limited access to epitopes targeted by broadly neutralizing Abs (bnAbs) that are effective against multiple geographically diverse HIV-1 strains ( Doores et al., 2010a 27. Doores, K.J. ∙ Bonomelli, C. ∙ Harvey, D.J. ... Envelope glycans of immunodeficiency virions are almost entirely oligomannose antigens Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

HIV-1 Env-reactive bnAbs have been described that used long complementary-determining region (CDR) loops to gain access to bnAb epitopes in the Env protein, while also making stabilizing contacts with surrounding glycans ( Walker et al., 2009 103.

Scanlan, C.N. ∙ Offer, J. ∙ Zitzmann, N. ... Exploiting the defensive sugars of HIV-1 for drug and vaccine design Nature. 2007; 446 :1038-1045 Crossref Scopus (202) PubMed Google Scholar ). The Ab 2G12 has been the only example to date of an HIV-1 bnAb that interacts solely with glycans on Env ( Calarese et al., 2003 16. Calarese, D.A. ∙ Scanlan, C.N. ∙ Zwick, M.B. ... Antibody domain exchange is an immunological solution to carbohydrate cluster recognition Science. 2003; 300 :2065-2071 Crossref Scopus (646) PubMed Google Scholar ). 2G12 has a relatively short variable heavy (V H ) domain CDR3 loop and a unique domain-swapped architecture in which the V H domains of the two fragment antigen-binding (Fab) arms of the 2G12 IgG swap to create a Fab-dimerized multivalent surface that facilitates strong interaction with glycans on Env ( Doores et al., 2010b 28.

Fab dimerization by 2G12 has been shown to be essential for optimal HIV-1 biological function, thus distinguishing it from conventional polyreactive Abs with low-level glycan interactions ( Doores et al., 2010b 28.

The bnAb 2G12 binds HIV-1 Env with nanomolar affinity, primarily due to its multivalent recognition of a unique glycan cluster ( Scanlan et al., 2002 88.

In addition to HIV-1 Env, 2G12 also bound Candida albicans yeast, which presents a similar Man(α1-2)Man motif as HIV-1 Env glycans ( Doores et al., 2010b 28. Doores, K.J. ∙ Fulton, Z. ∙ Huber, M. ...

Here, we report multiple Fab-dimerized glycan-reactive (FDG) Abs that target HIV-1 Env. FDG B cells were common in rhesus macaques (RMs) before virus infection or vaccination and resided in a mutated IgM + IgD + CD27 + B cell pool in HIV-1 naive humans. Fab dimerization occurred by several mechanisms, including Fab-Fab disulfide linkage, hydrophobic interactions, and hydrogen bonding—none of which required V H domain swapping for HIV-1 neutralization. FDG Abs, in addition to binding yeast and HIV-1 Env glycans, also recognized a glycan cluster in the S2 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike. Thus, our study emphasized the specificity of FDG Abs for glycosylated proteins and suggested that this natural FDG Ab precursor pool can target diverse human pathogens.

We previously reported a glycopeptide (Man 9 -V3) mimic of a bnAb epitope containing high-mannose glycoforms on native HIV-1 Env trimer ( Alam et al., 2017 3.

HIV envelope V3 region mimic embodies key features of a broadly neutralizing antibody lineage epitope Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :1111 Crossref Scopus (10) PubMed Google Scholar ). In an effort to induce bnAbs that target high-mannose glycans on HIV-1 Env, four RMs previously immunized with monomeric Man 9 -V3 ( Alam et al., 2017 3. Alam, S.M. ∙ Aussedat, B. ∙ Vohra, Y. ... Mimicry of an HIV broadly neutralizing antibody epitope with a synthetic glycopeptide Sci. Transl. Med. 2017; 9 :eaai7521 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ) were subsequently immunized with a multimeric form of Man 9 -V3 ( Figure 1 A). After repeated immunizations with monomeric Man 9 -V3, plasma Abs from two of the four RMs bound Man 9 -V3; whereas plasma from all four RMs bound Man 9 -V3 following a single immunization with multimeric Man 9 -V3 ( Figure 1 B). From a representative macaque, we isolated a 4-member DH717 Ab clonal lineage; DH717.1 IgG and DH717.2-DH717.4 IgMs were isolated before and after immunization with multimeric Man 9 -V3, respectively ( Figure 1 C; Data S3 ). Recombinant DH717 monoclonal Abs (mAbs) demonstrated glycan-dependent binding to Man 9 -V3 ( Alam et al., 2017 3. Alam, S.M. ∙ Aussedat, B. ∙ Vohra, Y. ... Mimicry of an HIV broadly neutralizing antibody epitope with a synthetic glycopeptide Sci. Transl. Med. 2017; 9 :eaai7521 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ), and bound soluble recombinant HIV-1 Env trimers ( Saunders et al., 2019 87. Saunders, K.O. ∙ Wiehe, K. ∙ Tian, M. ... Targeted selection of HIV-specific antibody mutations by engineering B cell maturation Science. 2019; 366 :eaay7199 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ), Candida albicans or Cryptococcus neoformans yeast glycans, and high mannose glycans including Man 9 GlcNAc 2 ( Figures 2 B–2D, S1 A, and S1B). DH717 mAbs neutralized env -pseudotyped HIV-1 bearing Envs with Man 9 -enriched glycans but did not neutralize corresponding wild-type HIV-1 bearing Envs with heterogeneous glycoforms ( Figure S1 C). Negative stain electron microscopy (NSEM) of DH717.1, DH717.2, and DH717.4 revealed a mixture of canonical Y-shaped Abs, as well as I-shaped Fab-dimerized Abs reminiscent of the I-shaped HIV-1 bnAb 2G12 ( Figure 1 D). In 2G12, the two Fabs lie side-by-side and in the same plane; thus, both Fabs are seen in a flatwise view via NSEM. In contrast, in DH717, one Fab is seen flatwise, whereas the other Fab is seen edgewise, suggesting that the two Fabs are turned relative to each other 90° about their long axes ( Figure 1 D). This arrangement was confirmed by 3D negative stain reconstruction of DH717.1 IgG ( Figure S1 D).
We obtained a 2.6-Å crystal structure of monomeric DH717.1 Fab complexed with Man 9 -V3 ( Figures 1 E and 1G; Data S4 ). DH717.1 V H interacted with the Man 9 -glycan using three HCDR loops to form a binding pocket into which Man 9 -glycan was inserted ( Figures 1 G and S1 E). No interactions were observed with the peptide itself, reminiscent of the glycan-only binding of 2G12 ( Doores et al., 2010b 28. Doores, K.J. ∙ Fulton, Z. ∙ Huber, M. ...

We also determined a 3.5-Å crystal structure of unliganded dimeric DH717.1 Fab ( Figures 1 F, 1H, and S1 G; Data S4 ). The structure revealed two disulfide-linked Fab dimers in the asymmetric unit, with a disulfide bond linking two Fabs via V H gene residues cysteine 74 ( Figure 1 H). DH717.3, which only showed Y-shaped Abs, had a serine at this position ( Figure S1 F), and disrupting the disulfide in DH717.1 with a cysteine to serine (C74S) mutation resulted in loss of DH717.1 I-shape forms ( Figure 1 I) and reduction in binding and neutralizing activity ( Figures 1 J, 1K, and S1 H). DH717.1 Fab monomer did not bind recombinant HIV-1 Env trimers, whereas the Fab dimer bound with micromolar affinity, and the DH717.1 IgG mAb bound with nanomolar affinity, thus demonstrating a role for avidity in Env glycan recognition of FDG Abs ( Data S1 ). These data showed that an inter-Fab disulfide linkage was the mechanism of Fab-dimerization for DH717 Abs that conferred biological activity against HIV-1.
We found V H genes prior to vaccination (week 0) with similar V H DJ H rearrangements as the DH717 V H genes from Abs isolated post vaccination ( Figure 2 A), indicating that they are clonally related. Week 0 DH717 V H genes were mutated IgMs, thus suggesting a role for host or environmental antigens in their initiation. DH717 B cell lineage was expanded following immunizations with monomeric and multimeric Man 9 -V3 ( Francica et al., 2019 34. Francica, J.R. ∙ Laga, R. ∙ Lynn, G.M. ...

Targeted selection of HIV-specific antibody mutations by engineering B cell maturation Science. 2019; 366 :eaay7199 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ) bearing near-native high mannose glycan patch ( Figure 2 A). Recombinant mAbs (DH717.5_NGS and DH717.6_NGS) bearing DH717 clonally related mutated IgM V H found at week 0 paired with post-vaccination DH717.1 V λ had minimal or no binding to soluble recombinant Env trimers, Man 9 -V3, Candida albicans yeast antigens, and high mannose glycans ( Figures 2 B–2E). Additionally, the DH717 mAb bearing the near-germline unmutated common ancestor (UCA) genes weakly bound Candida albicans glycans but did not bind Man 9 -V3, whereas the mature DH717 lineage mAbs demonstrated affinity maturation after Man 9 -V3 immunization as shown by increased binding to Man 9 -V3, soluble recombinant HIV-1 Env trimer, and Candida albicans or Cryptococcus neoformans yeast glycans ( Figures 2 B–2E).
To define the nature and characteristics of circulating DH717 FDG B cells, we interrogated the transcriptome of blood DH717 B cells. We studied 23 transcriptionally unique B cell clusters in blood DH717 lineage B cells, 1 week after final immunization with the nanoparticle form of Man 9 -V3 ( Figure 2 F). The DH717 B cells were found in clusters 0 and 4 ( Figure 2 F) that had 315 enriched genes that achieved statistical significance with a 0.3–1.4 log fold change ( Figure 2 G; Data S5 ). B cell receptor signaling pathway was enriched in both clusters 0 and 4, and IgM was the top gene enriched in cluster 4 with statistical significance (log fold change = 0.9, p < 0.001) ( Data S5 ). Interestingly, we found genes for IgM, phosphatases, and FcR-like proteins enriched in clusters 0 and 4, similar to transcripts previously found in human blood IgM memory and marginal zone (MZ) B cells ( Weller et al., 2004 107. Weller, S. ∙ Braun, M.C. ∙ Tan, B.K. ... Human blood IgM “memory” B cells are circulating splenic marginal zone B cells harboring a prediversified immunoglobulin repertoire Blood. 2004; 104 :3647-3654 Crossref Scopus (578) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, we found that IgM DH717.3 displayed an IgM + IgD + CD27 + phenotype ( Figure 2 H) in agreement with previously identified human blood marginal zone B cells ( Weill et al., 2009 106. Weill, J.C. ∙ Weller, S. ∙ Reynaud, C.A. Human marginal zone B cells Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 27 :267-285 Crossref Scopus (265) PubMed Google Scholar ; Weller et al., 2004 107. Weller, S. ∙ Braun, M.C. ∙ Tan, B.K. ... Human blood IgM “memory” B cells are circulating splenic marginal zone B cells harboring a prediversified immunoglobulin repertoire Blood. 2004; 104 :3647-3654 Crossref Scopus (578) PubMed Google Scholar ). Additional DH717 IgM Abs displayed IgM + and IgD + CD27 − or IgD − CD27 + phenotypes (not shown), thus implicating different differentiation pathways for DH717 lineage B cells.
We interrogated the B cell repertoire of nine HIV-1 naive individuals for candidate FDG Ab precursors that demonstrated Man 9 -V3 or yeast binding, and/or contained I-shaped Abs. Antigen-specific flow sorting revealed that candidate FDG Ab precursors were present at an average frequency of 1 per ∼340,000 B cells ( Figure 3 A), which was considerably greater than the frequencies of bnAb precursors that targeted different HIV-1 Env epitopes ( Steichen et al., 2019 96. Steichen, J.M. ∙ Lin, Y.C. ∙ Havenar-Daughton, C. ... A generalized HIV vaccine design strategy for priming of broadly neutralizing antibody responses Science. 2019; 366 :eaax4380 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ; Havenar-Daughton et al., 2018 42.

Med. 2018; 10 :eaat0381 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ). From flow sorting, 37 glycan-reactive Abs used a variety of heavy and light chain genes, although 46% used Vκ2-24 for the light chain ( Figure 3 B) in contrast to a Vκ2-24 frequency of 0.3%–0.6% in HIV-1 naive individuals ( DeKosky et al., 2015 25. DeKosky, B.J. ∙ Kojima, T. ∙ Rodin, A. ... In-depth determination and analysis of the human paired heavy- and light-chain antibody repertoire Nat. Med. 2015; 21 :86-91 Crossref Scopus (272) PubMed Google Scholar ), demonstrating immunoglobulin repertoire skewing as previously reported for natural Abs ( New et al., 2016 72. New, J.S. ∙ King, R.G. ∙ Kearney, J.F. Manipulation of the glycan-specific natural antibody repertoire for immunotherapy Immunol. Rev. 2016; 270 :32-50 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ). The majority of flow sorted candidate FDG precursor B cells (76.1%, 405/532) were IgM + IgD + CD27 + B cells ( Figure 3 C).
Seven FDG Abs were chosen, based on glycan binding activity, for expression as mAbs ( Data S3 ). Three of these, IgG3 DH1005, IgM DH1009, and IgM DH1010, displayed a mix of Y- and I-shaped Abs ( Figures 3 D–3F), and the I-shaped form of DH1005 bound soluble recombinant HIV-1 Env trimer ( Figure 3 D). All seven mAbs showed glycan-dependent binding to Man 9 -V3 and bound Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans yeast ( Figure 3 G). Only IgG3 DH1005 neutralized env -pseudotyped HIV-1 bearing Man 9 -enriched Envs ( Figure 3 H) but did not neutralize wild-type HIV-1 with Envs bearing heterogeneous glycoforms (not shown), thus exhibiting a neutralization profile similar to DH717 Abs that we classified as FDG precursors. These data demonstrated that FDG Abs were abundant in the B cell repertoire of HIV seronegative humans and may be found in the pool of IgM + IgD + CD27 + marginal zone B cells ( Weller et al., 2004 107. Weller, S. ∙ Braun, M.C. ∙ Tan, B.K. ... Human blood IgM “memory” B cells are circulating splenic marginal zone B cells harboring a prediversified immunoglobulin repertoire Blood. 2004; 104 :3647-3654 Crossref Scopus (578) PubMed Google Scholar ; Weill et al., 2009 106. Weill, J.C. ∙ Weller, S. ∙ Reynaud, C.A. Human marginal zone B cells Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 27 :267-285 Crossref Scopus (265) PubMed Google Scholar ).
DH1010 Fab-dimerized IgM mAb isolated from an HIV-1 naive individual had a free cysteine at position 74 in the V H gene, similar to DH717 mAbs isolated from an HIV-1 vaccinated RM. Of 77,336 immunoglobulin heavy and light chain gene pairs studied in three HIV-1 naive individuals (not shown), none contained a cysteine at position 74. Additionally, none of 201 germline V H genes in the human Cloanalyst Ig gene database ( Ramesh et al., 2017 80. Ramesh, A. ∙ Darko, S. ∙ Hua, A. ... Structure and Diversity of the Rhesus Macaque Immunoglobulin Loci through Multiple De Novo Genome Assemblies Front. Immunol. 2017; 8 :1407 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ; see STAR Methods ) had C74, and <1% of the Abs in the Abysis database ( Swindells et al., 2017 99. Swindells, M.B. ∙ Porter, C.T. ∙ Couch, M. ... abYsis: Integrated Antibody Sequence and Structure-Management, Analysis, and Prediction J. Mol. Biol. 2017; 429 :356-364 Crossref Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ) had a V H gene encoding C74. These data demonstrated that human Abs with a cysteine in V H position 74 are rare but they may be selected by Man 9 -V3 and HIV-1 Env trimer as observed in RMs by selection of DH717 Abs.
Because the unique 2G12 bnAb arose in human HIV-1 infection ( Buchacher et al., 1994 14. Buchacher, A. ∙ Predl, R. ∙ Strutzenberger, K. ... Generation of human monoclonal antibodies against HIV-1 proteins; electrofusion and Epstein-Barr virus transformation for peripheral blood lymphocyte immortalization AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1994; 10 :359-369 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), we sought to isolate FDG bnAbs from RMs infected with pathogenic SHIVs ( Roark et al., 2021 81. Roark, R.S. ∙ Li, H. ∙ Williams, W.B. ... Recapitulation of HIV-1 Env-antibody coevolution in macaques leading to neutralization breadth Science. 2021; 371 :eabd2638 Crossref Scopus (2) PubMed Google Scholar ). Infection with HIV ( Bonsignori et al., 2017 11. Bonsignori, M. ∙ Kreider, E.F. ∙ Fera, D. ... Staged induction of HIV-1 glycan-dependent broadly neutralizing antibodies Sci. Transl. Med. 2017; 9 :eaai7514 Crossref Scopus (80) PubMed Google Scholar ) or a SHIV ( Roark et al., 2021 81. Roark, R.S. ∙ Li, H. ∙ Williams, W.B. ... Recapitulation of HIV-1 Env-antibody coevolution in macaques leading to neutralization breadth Science. 2021; 371 :eabd2638 Crossref Scopus (2) PubMed Google Scholar ), with the same Env, elicited plasma bnAbs that targeted a high mannose glycan-containing epitope in humans and RMs, respectively. In one SHIV-infected RM ( Roark et al., 2021 81. Roark, R.S. ∙ Li, H. ∙ Williams, W.B. ... Recapitulation of HIV-1 Env-antibody coevolution in macaques leading to neutralization breadth Science. 2021; 371 :eabd2638 Crossref Scopus (2) PubMed Google Scholar ), we interrogated the glycan-reactive memory B cell repertoires in blood and lymph node at week 52 post-infection, and blood at week 104 post-infection.
A seven-member IgG Ab clonal lineage, termed DH898 ( Data S3 ), isolated from lymph node memory B cells at 52 weeks post SHIV infection, used macaque genes Vκ2 paired with V H 1 encoding a 13-amino acid HCDR3 ( Figure 4 A). DH898 mAbs mediated Env glycan-dependent neutralization of difficult-to-neutralize env -pseudotyped HIV-1 bearing Env from the autologous SHIV infection and neutralized heterologous env -pseudotyped HIV-1 bearing Envs with Man 9 -enriched glycans ( Figure 4 B) but neutralized none of 119 geographically diverse difficult-to-neutralize env-pseudotyped HIV-1 bearing heterologous Envs with heterogeneous glycoforms ( Seaman et al., 2010 92. Seaman, M.S. ∙ Janes, H. ∙ Hawkins, N. ... Tiered categorization of a diverse panel of HIV-1 Env pseudoviruses for assessment of neutralizing antibodies J. Virol. 2010; 84 :1439-1452 Crossref Scopus (463) PubMed Google Scholar ; not shown). Like 2G12, DH898 mAbs demonstrated glycan-dependent binding to Man 9 -V3 ( Figure 4 C) and bound yeast glycans ( Figure S2 A). DH898 mAbs also showed glycan-dependent binding to a soluble recombinant HIV-1 Env trimer ( Saunders et al., 2019 87. Saunders, K.O. ∙ Wiehe, K. ∙ Tian, M. ... Targeted selection of HIV-specific antibody mutations by engineering B cell maturation Science. 2019; 366 :eaay7199 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figures S2 B and S2C). By NSEM, DH898 mAbs showed a mixture of canonical Y-shaped as well as I-shaped Abs ( Calarese et al., 2003 16. Calarese, D.A. ∙ Scanlan, C.N. ∙ Zwick, M.B. ... Antibody domain exchange is an immunological solution to carbohydrate cluster recognition Science. 2003; 300 :2065-2071 Crossref Scopus (646) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figures 4 D and S2 D).
To visualize the DH898 epitope and Fab dimer interface, we determined cryo-EM structures of a soluble recombinant HIV-1 Env trimer bound to recombinant DH898.1 Fab ( Figures 4 E–4G and S3 ; Data S4 ; Videos S1 and S2 ). We identified three populations—an unliganded trimer, and two other populations, each with a single DH898 Fab dimer bound to two different epitopes. In one population, the Fab dimer bound multiple glycans at Env positions 332, 392, and 396, which included high mannose glycans targeted by 2G12 ( Figures 4 G and S3 ; Video S2 ), and was consistent with DH898 IgG mAbs dependence on glycan at Env position 332 for neutralization of the autologous strain ( Figure 4 B). In the second population, the Fab dimer bound glycans at Env positions 386, 362, and 276 around the Env CD4-binding site ( Figures S3 L–S3N; Video S2 ). In both complexes, the Fab dimer interfaces were well resolved and did not show V H domain-swapping ( Figures 4 F and S3 M). Instead, the DH898 Fabs dimerized via a side-by-side association of their V H domains, mediated by interfacial aromatic and hydrophobic residues ( Figures 4 H, S2 E, S3 O, and S3P). The DH898 Fab dimer interface also involved a glutamate-arginine pair at residues E10 and R12 that were located such that they could form salt bridges between the two V H chains ( Figure 4 I-4J), analogous to a D72 and R57 aspartate-arginine pair seen in 2G12 ( Calarese et al., 2003 16. Calarese, D.A. ∙ Scanlan, C.N. ∙ Zwick, M.B. ... Antibody domain exchange is an immunological solution to carbohydrate cluster recognition Science. 2003; 300 :2065-2071 Crossref Scopus (646) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mutations predicted to disrupt the Fab dimer interface yielded a lower proportion of I-shaped Abs and loss of Ab binding activity. Conversely, mutations predicted to strengthen the Fab dimer interface resulted in higher proportion of I-shaped Abs, albeit without any enhancement of binding and neutralizing activity ( Figures S2 F–S2I), suggesting that the I-shaped conformation is necessary but not sufficient for enhanced function. These data demonstrated that DH898 were FDG Abs and suggested that they could be bnAb precursors.

DH898 bound glycans near the CD4bs site on HIV-1 Env, related to Figure 4
A second four-member clonal lineage, termed DH851 ( Data S3 ), comprised of one IgM and three IgG Abs, was isolated from week 52 lymph node and blood (IgG DH851.1-DH851.3) and week 104 blood (IgM DH851.4) memory B cells; DH851 Abs used macaque genes V λ 2 paired with V H 2 encoding an HCDR3 of 15 amino acids ( Figure 5 A). DH851 IgG mAbs potently neutralized both autologous and heterologous HIV-1 isolates bearing Envs with Man 9 -glycans ( Figure S4 A). Only those DH851 mAbs that were class-switched IgGs in vivo (DH851.1, DH851.2, and DH851.3) broadly neutralized autologous and heterologous difficult-to-neutralize HIV-1 isolates bearing Envs with heterogeneous glycoforms, whereas DH851.4 (an IgM) did not ( Figure 5 B). DH851.1, DH851.2, and DH851.3 mAbs showed 26% neutralization breadth against a panel of 119 geographically diverse HIV-1 strains ( Figure S4 B) and were dependent on glycans at Env position 339, 386, and 392 glycans for neutralization ( Figure S4 C), which included high mannose glycans targeted by 2G12 ( Chuang et al., 2019 19. Chuang, G.Y. ∙ Zhou, J. ∙ Acharya, P. ... Structural Survey of Broadly Neutralizing Antibodies Targeting the HIV-1 Env Trimer Delineates Epitope Categories and Characteristics of Recognition Structure. 2019; 27 :196-206.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ). Like 2G12, DH851 mAbs bound soluble recombinant HIV-1 Env trimers and Man 9 -V3 in a glycan-dependent manner, and bound Candida albicans or Cryptococcus neoformans yeast glycans ( Figures 5 C and S4 D–S4G). Both bnAbs 2G12 and IgG DH851.2 cross-blocked each other for binding recombinant HIV-1 Envs ( Figures 5 D and 5E).
NSEM of DH851 IgGs (DH851.1-DH851.3) revealed a mixture of Y- and I-shaped Abs ( Figures 5 F and S4 H). In contrast, neither the mAbs bearing the near-germline DH851UCA genes nor the non-bnAb DH851 lineage member, DH851.4, were I-shaped ( Figure S4 H). The lack of I-shaped configurations for DH851.4 Ab and its inability to neutralize wild-type HIV-1 isolates bearing Envs with heterogeneous glycoforms suggested that Fab dimerization was required for heterologous HIV-1 neutralization.
In a 5.6-Å cryo-EM reconstruction of DH851.3 bound to a soluble recombinant HIV Env trimer, we observed Env bound to three side-by-side Fab dimers ( Figures 5 G, 5H and S5 ; Data S4 ). Unlike 2G12, and like the I-shaped DH898 Abs, the DH851.3 Fab dimers did not show V H -domain-swapping, with a clear gap between the two Fabs in the cryo-EM reconstruction. The DH851.3 Fab dimers bound Env glycans at positions 241, 289, and 334 located within a previously described Env glycan-containing bnAb epitope near the V3 loop ( Kong et al., 2013 53. Kong, L. ∙ Lee, J.H. ∙ Doores, K.J. ... Supersite of immune vulnerability on the glycosylated face of HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120 Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2013; 20 :796-803 Crossref Scopus (249) PubMed Google Scholar ) and consistent with the observed cross-blocking with 2G12 ( Figures 5 D and 5E). DH851 interactions with Env were dominated by its V H domains ( Figure 5 I), which were rotated such that the beta-strands of both chains were nearly parallel ( Figures 5 J and 5K), as opposed to being angled as seen in DH898 ( Figure 4 I); nevertheless, the interface featured hydrophobic and aromatic residues similar to 2G12 and DH898 ( Figures 5 L, S3 P, S4 I, and S5 ). DH851.4 and the DH851UCA lacked key hydrophobic residues ( Figure S4 I), and NSEM did not show Fab-dimerization ( Figure S4 H). In particular, DH851.4 has a T81R mutation that would place a bulky charged residue in the dimer interface, analogous to the I19R mutation that disrupts V H domain-swapping and Fab dimerization in 2G12 ( Doores et al., 2010b 28. Doores, K.J. ∙ Fulton, Z. ∙ Huber, M. ... Antibody 2G12 recognizes di-mannose equivalently in domain- and nondomain-exchanged forms but only binds the HIV-1 glycan shield if domain exchanged J. Virol. 2010; 84 :10690-10699 Crossref Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar ). In DH851, a dimer strengthening double mutant, A19V+T21L, increased the fraction of I-shaped Abs as expected ( Figure S4 J).
The structures of DH898 and DH851 Fab dimers suggested a common signature for non-domain-swapped V H -V H Fab dimerization mediated by interfacial hydrophobic and aromatic residues. This sequence signature was also observed in DH501 ( Data S2 A), a glycan-reactive Ab previously isolated from a macaque following HIV-1 Env immunization ( Saunders et al., 2017a 85. Saunders, K.O. ∙ Nicely, N.I. ∙ Wiehe, K. ... Vaccine Elicitation of High Mannose-Dependent Neutralizing Antibodies against the V3-Glycan Broadly Neutralizing Epitope in Nonhuman Primates Cell Rep. 2017; 18 :2175-2188 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ). NSEM of DH501 IgG showed the presence of I-shaped Abs ( Data S2 B). Recombinant DH501 Fabs also showed Fab dimer populations ( Data S2 C), and the previously published DH501 crystal structure (PDB: 5IIE ) revealed two Fabs within the unit cell, with their V H -domains in a side-by-side orientation reminiscent of the DH851 and DH898 Fab dimers ( Data S2 D). Mutations designed to strengthen or weaken the crystallographic dimer interface, increased or decreased the proportion of I-shaped DH501 IgG population observed, respectively ( Data S2 E–S2G), thus confirming that the crystallographic dimer was in fact a biologically relevant Fab dimer. When docked as a rigid body, the DH501 dimer showed good fit to the DH851 cryo-EM map ( Data S2 H). Analysis of the DH501 crystallographic dimer thus provided high-resolution insights into a non-domain-swapped Fab dimer interface ( Data S2 J–S2O). These data revealed common sequence and structural features of non-domain-swapped FDG Abs DH898, DH851, and DH501 ( Figures S2 E and S4 I; Data S2 I) that includes the same V H hydrophobic pattern seen in 2G12, involving rare framework mutations.
We isolated another FDG bnAb lineage (DH1003) from a RM infected with a pathogenic SHIV different from the one that elicited DH851 ( Data S2 P and S3 ). Sequence analysis of DH1003 lineage Abs showed numerous hydrophobic residues among the key interface residues implicated in Fab dimerization ( Data S2 Q). Representative DH1003 mAbs showed predominantly I-shaped Abs by NSEM, demonstrated glycan-dependent binding to Man 9 -V3, bound to Candida albicans , and neutralized autologous and heterologous difficult-to-neutralize HIV-1 isolates bearing Envs with heterogeneous glycoforms ( deCamp et al., 2014 24. deCamp, A. ∙ Hraber, P. ∙ Bailer, R.T. ... Global panel of HIV-1 Env reference strains for standardized assessments of vaccine-elicited neutralizing antibodies J. Virol. 2014; 88 :2489-2507 Crossref Scopus (153) PubMed Google Scholar ; Data S2 S–S2V). These data demonstrated the reproducibility of FDG bnAb generation in macaque SHIV infections.
Class-switched and mutated DH898 and DH851 clonally related V H genes were found in peripheral blood cells collected prior to macaque SHIV infection (week 0), suggesting that host or environmental antigens may have initiated FDG Ab lineages. We found 596 DH898 and 235 DH851 clonally related sequences that were predominantly IgM. To determine the binding profile of week 0 clonally related DH851 V H sequences, recombinant mAbs bearing week 0 DH851 IgG (DH851.5) or IgM (DH851.6 and DH851.8) clonally related V H DJ H were paired with DH851 V λ genes. These pre-infection DH851 mAbs bound weakly to yeast antigens and soluble recombinant HIV-1 Env trimers, but did not bind Man 9 -V3; in contrast, post-SHIV-infection DH851 mAbs robustly bound yeast antigens, Man 9 -V3, and soluble recombinant HIV-1 Env trimers ( Figures S4 D, S4F, and S4G). Pre- and post-infection IgM DH851 lineage Abs showed only Y-shaped populations by NSEM, whereas post-SHIV infection IgG DH851 lineage Abs showed Fab-dimerized, I-shaped populations ( Figure S4 H). These data suggested that FDG precursors existed as mutated or class-switched non-Fab-dimerized Abs prior to SHIV infection, with lineage stimulation potentially triggered by glycan-bearing host or environmental antigens.
Site-specific glycan analysis demonstrated that oligomannose-type glycans, including high mannose constitutes 28% of the glycans on the recombinant spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the current COVID-19 pandemic ( Watanabe et al., 2020 104. Watanabe, Y. ∙ Allen, J.D. ∙ Wrapp, D. ... Site-specific glycan analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 spike Science. 2020; 369 :330-333 Crossref Scopus (317) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because FDG Abs recognized high mannose glycans, we tested them for binding SARS-CoV-2 S protein. FDG mAbs, including bnAbs 2G12 and DH851, bound the SARS-Cov-2 S protein to varying degrees in a glycan-dependent manner ( Figures 6 A and S6 ). A 3.1-Å cryo-EM reconstruction revealed a 2G12 Fab dimer bound to the S2 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, with high-mannose glycans 717 and 801 from one protomer and glycan 709 from the adjacent protomer clustered together to form the 2G12 epitope ( Figures 6 B, 6C, and S7 ). The V H domain-swapped configuration of the 2G12 Fab dimer and its binding interface with the SARS-CoV-2 S protein were well-resolved, with the bound glycans clearly visible in the cryo-EM map. Deletion of glycan 709 reduced or eliminated 2G12 binding to the panel of FDG Abs tested ( Figures 6 D, 6E, and S6 ), thus demonstrating a common epitope for the FDG mAbs on the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Additionally, we found that 2G12 also bound the SARS-CoV-2 and MERS S ectodomains ( Figure S6 ).
Previous reports indicated that the 2G12 bnAb was not polyreactive for binding recombinant human autoantigens ( Haynes et al., 2005 44. Haynes, B.F. ∙ Fleming, J. ∙ St Clair, E.W. ... Cardiolipin polyspecific autoreactivity in two broadly neutralizing HIV-1 antibodies Science. 2005; 308 :1906-1908 Crossref Scopus (605) PubMed Google Scholar ; Liu et al., 2015 60. Liu, M. ∙ Yang, G. ∙ Wiehe, K. ... Polyreactivity and autoreactivity among HIV-1 antibodies J. Virol. 2015; 89 :784-798 Crossref Scopus (115) PubMed Google Scholar ), but a recent study demonstrated that glycan-dependent HIV-1 Env bnAbs also bound host cells from HIV-1 uninfected individuals in a glycan-dependent manner ( Blazkova et al., 2019 7. Blazkova, J. ∙ Refsland, E.W. ∙ Clarridge, K.E. ... Glycan-dependent HIV-specific neutralizing antibodies bind to cells of uninfected individuals J. Clin. Invest. 2019; 129 :4832-4837 Crossref Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ). Similarly, we found that 12 of 23 (52%) human or macaque FDG Abs and 2G12 bnAb bound HEp2 cells but were either weakly or non-reactive with a panel of human autoantigens ( Figure 7 ). The specificity of FDG mAbs for glycans suggested that HEp2 cell-FDG reactivity was glycan-mediated.

Section: Discussion

In this study, we identified a new category of prevalent glycan-reactive Abs that target diverse pathogens including HIV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and yeast. Although the Fab dimerized architectures of these glycan-reactive Abs bear resemblance to the unique glycan-reactive, V H -domain-swapped HIV-1 bnAb 2G12, they differ from 2G12 in their diverse mechanisms of Fab dimerization that occur without V H domain swapping.
FDG Abs isolated prior to SHIV infection or HIV vaccination were mainly mutated IgM, thus raising the hypothesis for MZ or IgM-memory B cells being a source for these Abs. The B cell sources of natural Abs have been well characterized in the spleen and MZ of mice ( Baumgarth, 2016 6. Baumgarth, N. B-1 Cell Heterogeneity and the Regulation of Natural and Antigen-Induced IgM Production Front. Immunol. 2016; 7 :324 Crossref Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lalor et al., 1989 55. Lalor, P.A. ∙ Herzenberg, L.A. ∙ Adams, S. ... Feedback regulation of murine Ly-1 B cell development Eur. J. Immunol. 1989; 19 :507-513 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Ichikawa et al., 2015 48.

Immunol. 2015; 194 :606-614 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ), but the phenotype of the B cells that generate natural Abs in peripheral blood of humans are not fully established ( Holodick et al., 2017 45. Holodick, N.E. ∙ Rodríguez-Zhurbenko, N. ∙ Hernández, A.M. Defining Natural Antibodies Front. Immunol. 2017; 8 :872 Crossref Scopus (76) PubMed Google Scholar ; Griffin et al., 2011 40. Griffin, D.O. ∙ Holodick, N.E. ∙ Rothstein, T.L. Human B1 cells in umbilical cord and adult peripheral blood express the novel phenotype CD20+ CD27+ CD43+ CD70- J. Exp. Med. 2011; 208 :67-80 Crossref Scopus (402) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our data demonstrated that human and RM FDG B cells were predominately IgM + IgD + CD27 + , in agreement with circulating MZ B cells described in humans ( Weller et al., 2004 107. Weller, S. ∙ Braun, M.C. ∙ Tan, B.K. ... Human blood IgM “memory” B cells are circulating splenic marginal zone B cells harboring a prediversified immunoglobulin repertoire Blood. 2004; 104 :3647-3654 Crossref Scopus (578) PubMed Google Scholar ). FDG and 2G12 bnAbs have relatively short HCDR3 segments, target only glycans, and are more common than HIV-1 bnAbs with longer HCDR3s ( Haynes and Verkoczy, 2014 43. Haynes, B.F. ∙ Verkoczy, L. AIDS/HIV. Host controls of HIV neutralizing antibodies Science. 2014; 344 :588-589 Crossref Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar ; Steichen et al., 2019 96. Steichen, J.M. ∙ Lin, Y.C. ∙ Havenar-Daughton, C. ... A generalized HIV vaccine design strategy for priming of broadly neutralizing antibody responses Science. 2019; 366 :eaax4380 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ). FDG Abs also used varied immunogenetics, thus indicative of a category of Abs, unlike previous classes of bnAb lineages that use more restricted heavy and light chain genes ( Zhou et al., 2013 121. Zhou, T. ∙ Zhu, J. ∙ Wu, X. ..., NISC Comparative Sequencing Program Multidonor analysis reveals structural elements, genetic determinants, and maturation pathway for HIV-1 neutralization by VRC01-class antibodies Immunity. 2013; 39 :245-258 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (224) PubMed Google Scholar ; Bonsignori et al., 2018 12. Bonsignori, M. ∙ Scott, E. ∙ Wiehe, K. ... Inference of the HIV-1 VRC01 Antibody Lineage Unmutated Common Ancestor Reveals Alternative Pathways to Overcome a Key Glycan Barrier Immunity. 2018; 49 :1162-1174.e8 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We previously showed that in a clonal bnAb lineage (termed DH270), early lineage members only neutralized HIV-1 bearing Man 9 -enriched Envs, whereas mature bnAbs neutralized autologous and heterologous HIV-1 bearing Envs with heterogeneous glycoforms ( Bonsignori et al., 2017 11. Bonsignori, M. ∙ Kreider, E.F. ∙ Fera, D. ... Staged induction of HIV-1 glycan-dependent broadly neutralizing antibodies Sci. Transl. Med. 2017; 9 :eaai7514 Crossref Scopus (80) PubMed Google Scholar ), thus demonstrating evolution of Abs within a lineage to achieve bnAb status through recognition of Envs with heterogeneous glycoforms. Similarly, although FDG precursors generally neutralized only HIV-1 bearing Envs with high mannose glycans, FDG bnAbs neutralized HIV-1 bearing Envs with heterogeneous glycoforms.
Our data also demonstrated that FDG and 2G12 mAbs had limited polyreactivity. It was postulated that the recognition of a unique glycan patch on HIV-1 Env was key for 2G12 maturation and neutralization potency ( Scanlan et al., 2002 88. Scanlan, C.N. ∙ Pantophlet, R. ∙ Wormald, M.R. ... The broadly neutralizing anti-human immunodeficiency virus type 1 antibody 2G12 recognizes a cluster of alpha1-->2 mannose residues on the outer face of gp120 J. Virol. 2002; 76 :7306-7321 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). FDG Abs can also recognize the HIV-1 Env glycan patch, thus supporting the hypothesis for affinity maturation of FDG B cell lineages via HIV Env selection. Moreover, we demonstrated that avidity was important for glycan recognition by FDG Abs as vaccine-induced DH717 Fab had minimal Env-binding compared to DH717 IgG. We reported two examples where the Y-shaped forms of the Abs were less optimal for HIV-1 Env glycan recognition. First, 2G12 mutations that disrupted its Fab dimer resulted in loss of glycan binding ( Huber et al., 2010 47. Huber, M. ∙ Le, K.M. ∙ Doores, K.J. ... Very few substitutions in a germ line antibody are required to initiate significant domain exchange J. Virol. 2010; 84 :10700-10707 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Second, Y-shaped DH851.4 IgM showed decreased binding and limited neutralization capacity compared to the Fab-dimerized DH851.1-DH851.3 IgG Abs within the same lineage. Thus, through Fab dimerization, FDG Abs acquired improved affinity and/or avidity for binding Env glycans, including the high mannose patch targeted by 2G12.
FDG mAbs bound a glycan epitope in the S2 subunit of the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Consistent with a quaternary epitope, 2G12 binding was sensitive to SARS-CoV-2 S conformation with cold denaturation of the 2P S ectodomain resulting in reduced 2G12 binding ( Edwards et al., 2021 31. Edwards, R.J. ∙ Mansouri, K. ∙ Stalls, V. ... Cold sensitivity of the SARS-CoV-2 spike ectodomain Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2021; 28 :128-131 Crossref Scopus (2) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although these HIV-1 Env-directed FDG mAbs did not neutralize SARS-CoV-2 (not shown), our results suggest that FDG bnAbs may be matured to glycans on SARS-CoV-2 S. It remains unknown whether SARS-CoV-2 S-directed FDG mAbs have non-neutralizing protective effects.
The RM from which the FDG bnAb DH851 clonal lineage was isolated had relatively modest heterologous neutralizing plasma Abs that mapped to glycans in the high mannose patch as well as the peptide motif (GDIR) ( Roark et al., 2021 81. Roark, R.S. ∙ Li, H. ∙ Williams, W.B. ... Recapitulation of HIV-1 Env-antibody coevolution in macaques leading to neutralization breadth Science. 2021; 371 :eabd2638 Crossref Scopus (2) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, it is likely that FDG bnAbs that target only glycans were minor components of the B cell repertoire of this macaque.
Other modalities of Fab-dimerization have been recently described, including head-to-head dimerization mediated by the CDR loops and intermolecular Fab dimers ( Plath et al., 2016 76. Plath, F. ∙ Ringler, P. ∙ Graff-Meyer, A. ... Characterization of mAb dimers reveals predominant dimer forms common in therapeutic mAbs MAbs. 2016; 8 :928-940 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ). These Abs have been shown to target non-HIV antigens, including CD20 ( Rougé et al., 2020 83. Rougé, L. ∙ Chiang, N. ∙ Steffek, M. ... Structure of CD20 in complex with the therapeutic monoclonal antibody rituximab Science. 2020; 367 :1224-1230 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ) and malaria parasite ( Imkeller et al., 2018 49. Imkeller, K. ∙ Scally, S.W. ∙ Bosch, A. ... Antihomotypic affinity maturation improves human B cell responses against a repetitive epitope Science. 2018; 360 :1358-1362 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ), although the interactions they mediate differ substantially from the glycan interactions with the FDG Abs we describe in this study, where intramolecular Fab dimerization within the Ab is a mechanism for enhancing weak glycan interactions via avidity. Mouse B cell lines bearing mature 2G12 exhibited domain-swapped forms of the BCR ( Doores et al., 2013 29. Doores, K.J. ∙ Huber, M. ∙ Le, K.M. ... 2G12-expressing B cell lines may aid in HIV carbohydrate vaccine design strategies J. Virol. 2013; 87 :2234-2241 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ), but it remains unknown if the membrane-bound BCR of FDG bnAbs is analogous to BCR cross-linking that results in B cell activation ( Yang and Reth, 2010a 115. Yang, J. ∙ Reth, M. Oligomeric organization of the B-cell antigen receptor on resting cells Nature. 2010; 467 :465-469 Crossref Scopus (116) PubMed Google Scholar , 2010b 116. Yang, J. ∙ Reth, M. The dissociation activation model of B cell antigen receptor triggering FEBS Lett. 2010; 584 :4872-4877 Crossref Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ).
It is important to note that FDG bnAbs with the capacity to neutralize autologous and heterologous difficult-to-neutralize HIV-1 bearing heterogeneous glycoforms in this report were only isolated from SHIV-infected RMs. SHIV-induced DH851 and DH1003 FDG bnAbs were class-switched, suggesting B cell maturation events occurred in SHIV infection that did not occur during precursor expansion with vaccination. We have previously shown that HIV-1-infected individuals who make bnAbs have multiple immunoregulatory abnormalities that create a permissive immunological environment for bnAb development ( Moody et al., 2016 69. Moody, M.A. ∙ Pedroza-Pacheco, I. ∙ Vandergrift, N.A. ... Immune perturbations in HIV-1-infected individuals who make broadly neutralizing antibodies Sci. Immunol. 2016; 1 :aag0851 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Bradley et al., 2018 13. Bradley, T. ∙ Peppa, D. ∙ Pedroza-Pacheco, I. ... RAB11FIP5 Expression and Altered Natural Killer Cell Function Are Associated with Induction of HIV Broadly Neutralizing Antibody Responses Cell. 2018; 175 :387-399.e17 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ; Roskin et al., 2020 82. Roskin, K.M. ∙ Jackson, K.J.L. ∙ Lee, J.Y. ... Aberrant B cell repertoire selection associated with HIV neutralizing antibody breadth Nat. Immunol. 2020; 21 :199-209 Crossref Scopus (12) PubMed Google Scholar ). It will be of interest to determine if SHIV-infected RMs that make bnAbs have similar immunoregulatory abnormalities and whether FDG bnAbs can be found in chronic HIV-1-infected humans. Our data showed that we expanded FDG B cell lineages via vaccination, thus implying that FDG B cells were not tightly controlled by immune tolerance. Finally, that FDG Abs can bind multiple glycan clusters and use multiple BCRs, combined with FDG precursors being well represented in human B cell repertoire make this new category of glycan-reactive B cells an attractive target to consider for induction by HIV-1 vaccines. Since the submission of this paper, Lee et al. have reported that the FDG Ab 2G12 can neutralize strains of influenza (Lee et al., 2021) 57. Lee, C.-C.D. ∙ Watanabe, Y. ∙ Wu, N.C. ... A cross-neutralizing antibody between HIV-1 and influenza virus PLOS PATHOGENS. 2021; 17 , e1009407 Crossref Scopus (2) PubMed Google Scholar , further demonstrating the breadth of cross-binding activity of the 2G12 FDG Ab for glycosylated virus pathogens.
We evaluated glycan-reactivity of FDG Abs on recombinant HIV-1 Env and SARS-CoV-2 S proteins, which may exclude different glycoforms only found on these surface proteins on the intact viruses in vivo . The frequency of FDG precursors was estimated in peripheral blood cells of nine HIV-1 naive individuals, thus future studies in a larger cohort of individuals and in other immune tissues will be informative about the prevalence of these Abs. We defined blood-derived FDG B cells as MZ-like, thus future studies of spleen-derived MZ B cells will verify this pool of B cells as a source of FDG Abs.

All RMs were maintained in accordance with the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animals. Research was conducted in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act and other federal statutes and regulations relating to animals and experiments involving animals and adheres to principles stated in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, NRC Publication, 2011 edition.
Immunization of Indian origin RMs and blood draws were performed at (Bioqual Inc., Rockville, MD). The four animals in this study were as follows: RM5932 (male, 3.5 years old), RM5994 (male, ∼4 years old), RM5995 (female, 5.25 years old), and RM5996 (female, 5.25 years old). DH717 lineage mAbs were isolated from RM5996. All vaccine doses were divided in to equal volume and injected in the bilateral quadriceps muscles. The RMs were first immunized with a dose-escalation of Man 9 -V3 monomer (50 μg, 100 μg, and 500 μg) each formulated in 25 μg GLA-SE adjuvant. 50 μg of monomeric Man 9 -V3 was administered at weeks 0, 6, and 12. 100 μg of monomeric Man 9 -V3 was administered at weeks 18 and 24. 500 μg of monomeric Man 9 -V3 was administered at weeks 50 and 56. Dose escalation of monomeric Man 9 -V3 was then followed by 300 μg of Man 9 -V3 multimer (∼6-mer) scaffolded onto N-(2-Hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide (HPMA) linear copolymer in 25 μg of GLA-SE given at week 71. Subsequently, RMs were immunized with a series of sequential soluble stabilized recombinant HIV-1 Env trimers (termed SOSIPs) (200 μg each) adjuvanted in 1 mg of Hiltonol Poly ICLC adjuvant (Oncovir). HIV-1 Env SOSIP trimers used for immunization were derived from CH848 Env strains previously identified as candidate immunogens for eliciting bnAbs that target glycans on the Env high mannose patch in conjunction with the Env peptide backbone ( Bonsignori et al., 2017 11. Bonsignori, M. ∙ Kreider, E.F. ∙ Fera, D. ... Staged induction of HIV-1 glycan-dependent broadly neutralizing antibodies Sci. Transl. Med. 2017; 9 :eaai7514 Crossref Scopus (80) PubMed Google Scholar ); 10.17 (week 103), 10.31 (week 109), 80.06 (week 115), 5.41 (week 127) and 25.02 (week 135). RMs were finally immunized with Star-Man 9 -V3 bearing the PADRE T cell helper epitope (300 μg) in 25 μg GLA-SE at week 143. Blood samples were collected two weeks post-immunization. The RM immunogenicity study in this paper was designed to evaluate the immunogenicity and dose of Man 9 -V3 monomer and to determine the effect of multimerization of Man 9 -V3 and later full envelope trimers, as boosts. The rational for the doses used were based on our previous experience with peptide immunogens ( Zhang et al., 2016 118. Zhang, R. ∙ Verkoczy, L. ∙ Wiehe, K. ... Initiation of immune tolerance-controlled HIV gp41 neutralizing B cell lineages Sci. Transl. Med. 2016; 8 :336ra62 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, we designed a dose escalation immunization study with the Man 9 -V3 monomer to study its immunogenicity and determine whether increased valency by multimerization improved the immunogenicity of the glycopeptide. Man 9 -V3 was previously used as a bait to isolate an HIV-1 Env bnAb that targeted N332 glycan in the high mannose patch in conjunction with the GDIR motif in the Env peptide backbone ( Alam et al., 2017 3. Alam, S.M. ∙ Aussedat, B. ∙ Vohra, Y. ... Mimicry of an HIV broadly neutralizing antibody epitope with a synthetic glycopeptide Sci. Transl. Med. 2017; 9 :eaai7521 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ), both of which comprise the V3 glycan bnAb epitope. Thus, Man 9 -V3 was postulated to be a possible prime for bnAb precursors that target Env-glycan containing epitopes, including V3 glycan bnAbs; and the 5-valent soluble recombinant HIV-1 Env trimers were subsequently postulated to be candidate immunogens to boost these bnAb precursor B cells ( Bonsignori et al., 2017 11. Bonsignori, M. ∙ Kreider, E.F. ∙ Fera, D. ... Staged induction of HIV-1 glycan-dependent broadly neutralizing antibodies Sci. Transl. Med. 2017; 9 :eaai7514 Crossref Scopus (80) PubMed Google Scholar ). Hence, our approach to prime with Man 9 -V3 and boost with multimerized Man 9 -V3 and then the Env trimers. However, our studies showed that Man 9 -V3 and one of the trimers (CH848 10.17) were able to select FDG B cells rather than V3-glycan bnAbs, and are thus candidate immunogens for future vaccine strategies to elicit FDG Abs.
SHIV infection of Indian RMs were performed at (Bioqual Inc., Rockville, MD) and previously described ( Roark et al., 2021 81. Roark, R.S. ∙ Li, H. ∙ Williams, W.B. ... Recapitulation of HIV-1 Env-antibody coevolution in macaques leading to neutralization breadth Science. 2021; 371 :eabd2638 Crossref Scopus (2) PubMed Google Scholar ). HIV-1 transmitted-founder (TF) Envs were derived from viruses that established infection in humans, thus TF Env-bearing SHIVs ( Li et al., 2016 58. Li, H. ∙ Wang, S. ∙ Kong, R. ... Envelope residue 375 substitutions in simian-human immunodeficiency viruses enhance CD4 binding and replication in rhesus macaques Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113 :E3413-E3422 Crossref Scopus (118) PubMed Google Scholar ) provided a novel model for studying HIV-1 infection as described ( Roark et al., 2021 81. Roark, R.S. ∙ Li, H. ∙ Williams, W.B. ... Recapitulation of HIV-1 Env-antibody coevolution in macaques leading to neutralization breadth Science. 2021; 371 :eabd2638 Crossref Scopus (2) PubMed Google Scholar ). Blood and plasma samples were collected for binding and neutralization assays. HIV/SHIV bearing CH848TF Env was referred to as an autologous virus strain. DH851 and DH898 mAbs were isolated from a single macaque (RM6163; female, ∼5 years old) that was infected with a SHIV bearing HIV-1 CH848TF Env strain, and DH1003 mAbs were isolated from a different macaque (RM10N011; male, ∼8 years old) that was infected with a SHIV bearing HIV-1 BG505.T332N Env strain.
Our cohort of nine HIV-1 seronegative adults aged 18-48 years (mix of both males and females) were bled for leukapheresis PBMCs in the summer of 2019 or earlier, thus it is unlikely that they were COVID-19 convalescent subjects. From our observation that FDG mAbs bound glycans on SARS-CoV-2 spike, we hypothesized that FDG Abs can be elicited by SARS-CoV-2 spike high mannose glycans and this is now currently being actively explored in COVID-19 convalescent subjects.
A single colony of yeast was inoculated into 250 mL YPD broth and grown for 2 days at 30°C on a shaking incubator set at 225 rpm. The cells were harvested and washed thrice with PBS. The pellets were resuspended in 11 mL PBS and the cell concentration was determined (C. albicans, 3.40x10e9 CFUs/ml and C. neoformans, 1.62x10e9 CFUs/ml, respectively). To heat-kill the yeast, the cells were incubated for 24h at 60°C in a water bath. Three hundred microliters of the heat-killed yeast were plated onto YPD agar, incubated for 7 days to ensure no viable yeast were present.
The Man 9 -V3 monomer comprising a 30 amino acid V3-glcocopeptide with high-mannose (Man 9 GlcNAc 2 ) glycans at position 301 and 332 based on the clade B JRFL mini-V3 construct ( Pejchal et al., 2011 74.

A potent and broad neutralizing antibody recognizes and penetrates the HIV glycan shield Science. 2011; 334 :1097-1103 Crossref Scopus (523) PubMed Google Scholar ) was synthesized as previously described ( Alam et al., 2017 3.

Med. 2017; 9 :eaai7521 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ). Man 9 -V3 multimer was synthesized by reacting multiple copies of a Man 9 -V3 monomer with a multivalent amino group-reactive HPMA-based co-polymer that was prepared as previously described ( Lynn et al., 2015 61. Lynn, G.M. ∙ Laga, R. ∙ Darrah, P.A. ... In vivo characterization of the physicochemical properties of polymer-linked TLR agonists that enhance vaccine immunogenicity Nat.

Star nanoparticles delivering HIV-1 peptide minimal immunogens elicit near-native envelope antibody responses in nonhuman primates PLoS Biol. 2019; 17 :e3000328 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this study, Man 9 -V3 multimer and Star-Man 9 -V3 (∼50nm construct containing multiple Man 9 -V3 units) were used as macromolecular nanosized forms of Man 9 -V3 monomer for immunization of RMs.
Production of recombinant HIV-1 Envs, including gp120 monomers, and unstabilized gp140 and stabilized SOSIP trimers was previously described ( Francica et al., 2019 34.

Recombinant Envs were used for binding assays and NHP immunizations. The main Env strains for soluble stabilized recombinant HIV-1 Env trimers (SOSIPs) used in this study were previously described ( Bonsignori et al., 2017 11.

We tested wild-type and mutant (N301A, N301AN332A, N133DN138T and degly4) Env trimers listed above to evaluate mAb binding. For HIV-1 Env trimer immunizations in macaques, the following HIV-1 Env CH848 strains were generated as soluble stabilized recombinant trimers (SOSIPs); CH848 10.17., CH848 10.31, CH848 80.06, CH848 5.41 and CH848 25.02. These trimers constitute a sequential 5-valent series of CH848 Env stabilized trimers that had evolved during human CH848TF infection and were predicted to be involved in the induction of HIV-1 Env bnAbs that target glycans in the high mannose in conjunction with the GDIR motif in the Env peptide ( Bonsignori et al., 2017 11. Bonsignori, M. ∙ Kreider, E.F. ∙ Fera, D. ... Staged induction of HIV-1 glycan-dependent broadly neutralizing antibodies Sci. Transl. Med. 2017; 9 :eaai7514 Crossref Scopus (80) PubMed Google Scholar ). Since macaques were infected with a pathogenic SHIV bearing HIV-1 CH848TF Env, recombinant HIV-1 Env trimers bearing CH848TF were referred to as autologous Envs when testing mAbs isolated from SHIV-infected macaques. In instances where high mannose glycosylation was desired, Kifunensine (Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and added once to the cell culture media to a final concentration of 25 μM. The cells were cultured for 5 days and on the fifth day the cell culture media was cleared of cells by centrifugation and filtered with 0.8 um filter. The cell culture was concentrated with a Vivaflow 50 (Sartorius) with a 10 kd MWCO. The concentrated cell culture supernatant was rotated with lectin beads (Vistar Labs) overnight at 4°C. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation the next day and resuspended in MES wash buffer. The lectin beads were washed twice and the protein was eluted with methyl-α-pyranoside. The protein was buffer exchanged into PBS and stored at –80°C.
The SARS-CoV-2, SARS and MERS ectodomain constructs were produced and purified as previously described ( Wrapp et al., 2020 112. Wrapp, D. ∙ Wang, N. ∙ Corbett, K.S. ... Cryo-EM structure of the 2019-nCoV spike in the prefusion conformation Science. 2020; 367 :1260-1263 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, genes encoding residues 1−1208 of SARS-CoV-2 S (GenBank: MN908947), residues 1-1291 for MERS S (GenBank KJ650098.1 ) and residues 1-1190 for SARS S (UniProt P59594-1) with proline substitutions at residues 986 and 987 (SARS-CoV-2), 1060-1061 (MERS) and 968-969 (SARS) and a “GSAS” substitution at the furin cleavage site (residues 682–685) for SARS-CoV-2 was synthesized and cloned into the mammalian expression vector pαH. In all constructs, a C-terminal T4 fibritin trimerization motif, an HRV3C protease cleavage site, a TwinStrepTag and an 8XHisTag were also included. All other mutants were introduced in these backgrounds. Expression plasmids encoding the ectodomains sequences were used to transiently transfect FreeStyle293F cells using Turbo293 (SpeedBiosystems). Protein were purified on the sixth day post transfection from the filtered supernatant using StrepTactin resin (IBA). Affinity purified protein was run over a Superose 6/300 increase column. The purified proteins were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C.
Antigen-specific memory B cells were isolated from RMs or humans using fluorophore-labeled antigens as hooks in various sort strategies outlined below. Antigens used for sorts were conjugated with Alexa Fluor 647 (AF647), Brilliant Violet 421 (BV421), or VioBright 515 (VB515) fluorophores. With the exception of peptides, immune cells were concurrently incubated with a cocktail of staining Abs and fluorophore-labeled antigens. Fluorophore-labeled peptides required an incubation with immune cells prior to addition of the staining antibody cocktail to improve binding efficiency. Fluorophore-labeled peptides were used at a ratio of 2.5μg per 10 million cells, recombinant gp120 and gp140 proteins at 10μg per 10 million cells, and SOSIP trimers at 90pmol per 10 million cells, to stain antigen-specific memory B cells. All incubations took place in approximately 1mL of buffer per 10 million cells. Flow cytometry sorts were performed using a BD FACSAria II (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), and the data were analyzed using FlowJo (Treestar, Ashland, OR). Single cell Env-reactive Abs were CD3 (BD Cat#552852; 5μl per test)/ CD14 (BioLegend Cat#301832; 2.5μl per test)/ CD16 (BD Cat#557744; 5μl per test), and/or surface IgD (Southern Biotech Cat#2030-09; 1μl per test) negative. Macaque B cells were also CD27+/− (BioLegend Cat#302816; 5μl per test) and CD20 (BioLegend Cat#302336; 1μl per test) positive, while human B cells were CD38+/− (Beckman Coulter Cat#IM2371U; 1μl per test) and CD19 (BD Cat#557791; 1μl per test) positive.
Single sorted B wells were obtained from RMs and humans using previously described flow cytometry-based sorts ( Williams et al., 2017b 111. Williams, W.B. ∙ Zhang, J. ∙ Jiang, C. ...

Initiation of immune tolerance-controlled HIV gp41 neutralizing B cell lineages Sci. Transl. Med. 2016; 8 :336ra62 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Cells were individually sorted into 96 well plates containing lysis buffer and immediately stored at −80, as previously described ( Liao et al., 2009 59. Liao, H.X. ∙ Levesque, M.C. ∙ Nagel, A. ... High-throughput isolation of immunoglobulin genes from single human B cells and expression as monoclonal antibodies J. Virol. Methods. 2009; 158 :171-179 Crossref Scopus (157) PubMed Google Scholar ). Rhesus macaque and human V H DJ H and V L J L segments were isolated by single-cell PCR approaches that were previously described ( Liao et al., 2009 59. Liao, H.X. ∙ Levesque, M.C. ∙ Nagel, A. ...

Methods. 2009; 158 :171-179 Crossref Scopus (157) PubMed Google Scholar ; Alam et al., 2017 3. Alam, S.M. ∙ Aussedat, B. ∙ Vohra, Y. ... Mimicry of an HIV broadly neutralizing antibody epitope with a synthetic glycopeptide Sci. Transl. Med. 2017; 9 :eaai7521 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ). Antibody sequences were analyzed using a custom-built bioinformatics pipeline for base-calling, contig assembly, quality trimming, immunogenetic annotation with Cloanalyst ( https://www.bu.edu/computationalimmunology/research/software/ ), VDJ sequence quality filtering, functionality assessment, and isotyping. Antigen-specific single B cells were indexed sorted, thus allowing us to perform a backgate analysis to identify individual IgM+IgD+CD27+ cells overlayed against the total sorted B cell populations in FlowJo (Treestar, Ashland, OR). In vaccinated RMs, Env-reactive B cells were sorted using soluble unstabilized recombinant HIV-1 Env trimer (HIV-1 JRFL gp140) bearing Envs with Man 9 -enriched protein (Kifunensine-treated Env) conjugated to both AF647 and BV421 fluorophores. The antigens for sorts of SHIV-infected B cells used tetramerized Man 9 -V3 and HIV-1 Env SOSIPs. The following flow cytometry sort strategies were used to investigate the repertoire of SHIV-elicited Env-reactive B cells, including glycan-reactive B cells: LN wk52 [Man 9 -V3 peptide (+) and Aglycone V3 peptide (-); CH848TF gp120 (+) and CH848TF gp120 N332A (-); and CH848TF SOSIPv4.1 (+)]; PBMCs wk52 [CH848TF gp120 (+) and CH848TF gp120 N332A (-)]; and PBMCs wk104 [Man 9 -V3 peptide (+) and Aglycone V3 peptide (-);CH848TF SOSIPv4.1 (+); CH848.d949.10.17 DS.SOSIP (+) and CH848.d949.10.17 DS.SOSIP N332A (-); and CH848.d949.10.17 DS.SOSIP (+) and CH848TF SOSIPv4.1 (-)].
In HIV-1 naive humans, Env-reactive B cells were sorted using glycopeptides and HIV-1 Env SOSIPs in the following differential sort strategies: (#1) Man 9 -V3 (+) versus Aglycone V3 peptide (-) in a dual or triple color sort strategy; (#2) CH848 10.17 DS.SOSIP (+) versus CH848 10.17 DS.SOSIP_N332A (-); and (#3) CH848 10.17 DS.SOSIP_N133DN138T (+) versus CH848 10.17 DS.SOSIP_N133DN138T_N332A (-). In three individuals (LPK01-LPK03), we sorted 20M PBMCs using strategy #1 (dual color differential sort) or strategy #2 (total for 2 sorts = 40 million PBMCs). For dual color differential sort strategy #1, we sorted B cells that were reactive with Man 9 -V3 conjugated to one fluorophore, but not the aglycone V3 peptide conjugated to a different fluorophore. In one individual (LPK04), we studied B cells enriched from 100 million leukapheresis PBMCs per experiment using sort strategy #3 (total for 2 sorts = 200 million PBMCs). In five individuals (LKP05-LKP09), we studied B cells enriched from 100 million leukapheresis PBMCs using sort strategy #1 (triple color differential sort); here we used a more stringent approach to sort B cells that were reactive with Man 9 -V3 conjugated to two different fluorophores, but was not reactive with aglycone V3 peptide conjugated to a third fluorophore. For subjects LKP04-LKP09, we performed negative B cell enrichment from 100M PBMCs in each experiment using a commercially available B cell enrichment kit according to manufacturer’s protocol (StemCell Technologies; Vancouver, BC, Canada). We calculated the frequency of human FDG B cells as the percent of all sorted B cell-derived recombinant IgGs produced in small-scale transfection that bound Man 9 -V3 but not aglycone V3 peptide and/or yeast antigens in ELISA, relative to the total number of B cells analyzed via flow cytometry sort per individual. The estimated frequency of human FDG B cells was reported as the average frequency of FDG B cells across the nine individuals studied.
Recombinant mAbs were first generated in human embryonic kidney epithelial cell lines (HEK293T, ATCC, Manassas, VA; Cat#CRL3216) in small scale transfections using linear cassettes encoding antibody heavy and light chain genes that were PCR amplified from single B cells ( Liao et al., 2009 59. Liao, H.X. ∙ Levesque, M.C. ∙ Nagel, A. ... High-throughput isolation of immunoglobulin genes from single human B cells and expression as monoclonal antibodies J. Virol. Methods. 2009; 158 :171-179 Crossref Scopus (157) PubMed Google Scholar ). For generation of larger quantities commercially-obtained (GeneScript, Piscataway, NJ) plasmids with antibody heavy and light chain genes were used to transfect suspension Expi 293i cells using ExpiFectamine 293 transfection reagents (Life Technologies, GIBCO; Cat#A14524) as described ( Bonsignori et al., 2017 11. Bonsignori, M. ∙ Kreider, E.F. ∙ Fera, D. ... Staged induction of HIV-1 glycan-dependent broadly neutralizing antibodies Sci. Transl. Med. 2017; 9 :eaai7514 Crossref Scopus (80) PubMed Google Scholar ). Purified recombinant mAbs were dialyzed against PBS, analyzed, and stored at 4°C. All recombinant mAbs were expressed from plasmids encoding a human or macaque IgG constant region, and were QC’ed in western blot for appropriate heavy and light chain protein expression and/or via size exclusion chromatograpgy (SEC) for a single peak indicative of stable antibody expression.
To purify DH717.1 Fab monomer for crystallization studies, the heavy- and light-chain variable and constant domains were cloned into a modified pVRC-8400 expression vector using NheI and NotI restriction sites and the tissue plasminogen activation signal sequence. The C terminus of the heavy-chain constructs contained a non-cleavable 6x-histidine tag. Fabs were expressed using transient transfection of HEK293T cells using linear polyethylenimine (PEI) following manufacturer’s protocols. After 5 days of expression, supernatants were clarified by centrifugation. His-tagged Fabs were loaded onto Ni-NTA superflow resin (QIAGEN) preequilibrated with Buffer A (10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl), washed with Buffer A + 350 mM imidazole, and eluted with Buffer A + 350 mM imidazole, Fabs were then purified by gel filtration chromatography in Buffer A using a superdex 200 analytical column. The fractions corresponding to monomer were pooled and concentrated. While intermolecular disulfide bonds can occur due to purification artifacts, intramolecular disulfide are likely to be formed in vivo because of the structural proximity of two unpaired cysteines, such as what we see in the DH717.1 Fab dimers.
Envelope binding to recombinant mAbs, and plasma or sera were tested in ELISA as previously described ( Williams et al., 2017a 110. Williams, L.D. ∙ Ofek, G. ∙ Schätzle, S. ... Potent and broad HIV-neutralizing antibodies in memory B cells and plasma Sci. Immunol. 2017; 2 :eaal2200 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Saunders et al., 2019 87. Saunders, K.O. ∙ Wiehe, K. ∙ Tian, M. ... Targeted selection of HIV-specific antibody mutations by engineering B cell maturation Science. 2019; 366 :eaay7199 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ). Binding was assessed using synthetic peptides, recombinant HIV-1 Env gp120, gp140, and stabilized chimeric SOSIP trimers, and heat-killed yeast antigens. ELISA protocols had modifications that supported binding to different antigens. In general, antigens were directly coated to Nunc-absorb (ThermoFisher) plates overnight at 4°C or captured using streptavidin, AbC-mAb (AVIDITY, Colorado, USA) or PGT151 mAb that were coated to Nunc-absorp plates overnight at 4°C. Unbound proteins were washed away and the plates were blocked with either goat serum-based (SuperBlock) ( Liao et al., 2009 59. Liao, H.X. ∙ Levesque, M.C. ∙ Nagel, A. ... High-throughput isolation of immunoglobulin genes from single human B cells and expression as monoclonal antibodies J. Virol. Methods. 2009; 158 :171-179 Crossref Scopus (157) PubMed Google Scholar ) or non-serum-based ( Alam et al., 2017 3. Alam, S.M. ∙ Aussedat, B. ∙ Vohra, Y. ... Mimicry of an HIV broadly neutralizing antibody epitope with a synthetic glycopeptide Sci. Transl. Med. 2017; 9 :eaai7521 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ) blocking media for 1 hour. Serial dilution of serum and mAbs were added to the plate for 60 and 90 minutes, respectively. Binding Abs were detected with specie-specific HRP-labeled anti-IgG Fc Abs using 20μl per reaction with 1 hour incubation at room temperature. HRP detection was subsequently quantified with 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB). ELISA binding levels were measured at an optical density of 450 nm (OD 450nm ) and binding titers were analyzed as area-under-curve of the log-transformed concentrations (Log AUC).
Binding to biotin-Man 9 -V3 and biotin-aglycone-V3 was determined as previously described using streptavidin for capturing each peptide on Nunc-absorb ELISA plates ( Alam et al., 2017 3. Alam, S.M. ∙ Aussedat, B. ∙ Vohra, Y. ... Mimicry of an HIV broadly neutralizing antibody epitope with a synthetic glycopeptide Sci. Transl. Med. 2017; 9 :eaai7521 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ; Bonsignori et al., 2017 11. Bonsignori, M. ∙ Kreider, E.F. ∙ Fera, D. ... Staged induction of HIV-1 glycan-dependent broadly neutralizing antibodies Sci. Transl. Med. 2017; 9 :eaai7514 Crossref Scopus (80) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, we coated 30ng of streptavidin in 15μl at 2μg/ml per well of a 384-well Nunc-absorb ELISA plate, sealed and incubated overnight at 4°C. Synthetic peptides (10ng) were added to streptavidin in 10μl at 1μg/ml for one hour at room temperature to facilitate peptide capture. Binding to yeast antigens was tested at 1:400 ( Cryptococcus neoformans ) and 1:2000 ( Candida albicans ) dilutions made in sodium bicarbonate buffer; 15μl of each yeast solution was coated per well of a 384-well Nunc-absorb ELISA plate, sealed and incubated overnight at 4°C. Yeast antigen reactivity was performed using ELISA conditions for assessing glycan reactivity on glycopeptides ( Alam et al., 2017 3. Alam, S.M. ∙ Aussedat, B. ∙ Vohra, Y. ... Mimicry of an HIV broadly neutralizing antibody epitope with a synthetic glycopeptide Sci. Transl. Med. 2017; 9 :eaai7521 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ). HRP-conjugated specie-specific secondary Abs were used to detect antibody binding to synthetic peptides and yeast antigens - Goat anti-human IgG-HRP, 1:15000 dilution (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Cat# 109-035-098); and Mouse anti-monkey IgG-HRP, 1:20000 dilution (Southern Biotech, Cat# 4700-05). The yeast dilutions tested in ELISA were found to be the lowest dilutions at which we observed maximal binding by glycan-reactive Abs, such as 2G12 in optimization assays. DH1013 isolated from RM5996 was used as a positive control mAb for peptide binding to Man 9 -V3 and Aglycone V3 peptides, and 2G12 or DH501 ( Saunders et al., 2017a 85.

For ELISAs with HIV-1 Env SOSIPs bearing an Avi-tag, the trimer was captured by the AbC- mAb antibody against C terminus Avi-tag, while non Avi-tagged SOSIP trimers were captured by PGT151 bnAb expressed in 293 cells as described ( Saunders et al., 2019 87.

Williams, L.D. ∙ Ofek, G. ∙ Schätzle, S. ... Potent and broad HIV-neutralizing antibodies in memory B cells and plasma Sci. Immunol. 2017; 2 :eaal2200 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, Avi-tag and PGT151 mAbs were coated at 30ng per well of a 384-well plate in 15μl at 2μg/ml. HIV-1 Env SOSIPs (20ng) were added to Avi-tag or PGT mAbs in 10μl at 2μg/ml for one hour at room temperature to facilitate SOSIP capture. PGT151 mAb was used as a positive control for binding Avi-tagged SOSIP, while influenza-specific antibody CH65 ( Whittle et al., 2011 108. Whittle, J.R. ∙ Zhang, R. ∙ Khurana, S. ... Broadly neutralizing human antibody that recognizes the receptor-binding pocket of influenza virus hemagglutinin Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108 :14216-14221 Crossref Scopus (299) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used as a negative control. HRP-conjugated specie-specific secondary Abs were used to detect binding Abs (see above). For non-Avi-tagged SOSIPs that were captured by PGT151 mAb, biotinylated mAbs were used as positive (B-2G12 and B-PGT128) and negative (B-CH65) controls - biotinylated-mAbs were tested at 10μg/ml and 3-fold dilutions. This latter approach was used to test only rhesus mAbs and b-mAbs, since the secondary Abs would not detect human PGT151 mAb used for SOSP capture; Mouse anti-monkey IgG-HRP (see above) and Streptavidin-HRP, 1:30000 dilution (Thermo Scientific, Ref# 21130). FDG mAbs, DH1005-DH1011, bound Man 9 -V3 but not aglycone V3 peptide in ELISA ( Figure 3 ). Additionally, DH1005-DH1011 had varied binding levels to Env SOSIP trimers (not shown). Competitive ELISA to assess cross-blocking of recombinant mAbs were previously described ( Alam et al., 2013 2. Alam, S.M. ∙ Liao, H.X. ∙ Tomaras, G.D. ...

Med. 2017; 9 :eaai7514 Crossref Scopus (80) PubMed Google Scholar ). We biotinylated the Abs using the following product: BIOTIN-X-NHS, Cayman Chemicals, Cat# 13316. Here, we studied biotinylated 2G12 and DH851 mAbs in competition ELISAs using CH848TF or CH848 10.17 gp120 Envs.
Competitive inhibition of biotiniylated-mAbs was measured as a percent of binding in the presence of a competing non-biotinylated mAb relative to binding in the absence of this competing mAb. A successful assay had positive control blocking ≥ 40%. DH851 blocking on CH848TF gp120 was from a single experiment ( Figure 5 ), but the results were similarly observed for blocking on CH848 10.17 gp120 in three separate experiments (not shown).
Recombinant FDG mAbs were tested for binding SARS-CoV-2 trimer (lot 62KJ) in ELISA in the absence or presence of single monomer D-mannose sugar. SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike protein was captured by streptavidin to individual wells of a 384-well plate, and serially diluted mAbs were tested for binding. ELISA binding assays were optimized to use SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that was aliquotted and frozen upon production; desired aliquots of frozen spike protein were thawed once at 37° and stored overnight at room temperature. SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and Man 9 -V3 and Aglycone V3 peptides were captured via streptavidin on Nunc-absorb ELISA plates using PBS-based buffers and assay conditions as previously described ( Alam et al., 2017 3. Alam, S.M. ∙ Aussedat, B. ∙ Vohra, Y. ... Mimicry of an HIV broadly neutralizing antibody epitope with a synthetic glycopeptide Sci. Transl. Med. 2017; 9 :eaai7521 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ; Bonsignori et al., 2017 11. Bonsignori, M. ∙ Kreider, E.F. ∙ Fera, D. ... Staged induction of HIV-1 glycan-dependent broadly neutralizing antibodies Sci. Transl. Med. 2017; 9 :eaai7514 Crossref Scopus (80) PubMed Google Scholar ). HIV-1 CH505TF SOSIP trimer and commercially-obtained constructs of SARS-CoV-2 spike ectodomain (S1+S2 ECD, S2 ECD and RBD) (Sino Biological Inc Cat#40589-V08B1 and 40590-V08B respectively and RBD from Genescript Cat#Z03483) were captured using mouse anti-AVI-tag mAb (Avidity LLC, Aurora, CO). In brief, we coated 30ng of streptavidin in 15μl at 2μg/ml or 30 ng of mouse anti-AVI-tag mAb in 15μl at 2μg/ml per well of a 384-well Nunc-absorb ELISA plate, sealed and incubated overnight at 4°C. SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (2μg/ml) were added to streptavidin in 10μl per well of a 384-well plate for one hour at room temperature to facilitate protein capture. HIV-1 CH505TF SOSIP, and recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S1+S2 ECD, S2 ECD and RBD spike proteins, at final concentration of 2 μg/ml were added to anti-AVI mAb in 10μl per well of a 384-well plate for one hour at room temperature to facilitate protein capture. Mouse anti-monkey IgG-HRP (Southern Biotech, CAT# 4700-05) or Goat anti-human IgG-HRP (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, CAT# 109-035-098) secondary Abs were used to detect mAb bound to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. HRP detection was subsequently quantified with 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) by measuring binding levels at an absorbance of 450nm; binding titers were reported as Log area under the curve (AUC).
Commercially obtained D-mannose (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was used to outcompete mAb binding to glycans on SARS-CoV-2; D-mannose solutions were produced in ELISA buffers. Competition ELISAs with D-mannose were performed in two separate assays; each with [0.5M] (data not shown) or [1.0M] D-mannose. Mouse-Human chimeric mAb D001 (SARS-CoV RBD mAb; Sino Biological Inc Cat#40150-D001) was used as a control mAb; D001 was tested at 2μg/ml and 2-fold serial dilutions (10x), in contrast to all other mAbs tested at 100μg/ml and 3-fold serial dilutions (10x). Anti-influenza CH65 mAb was used a negative control mAb. We found that goat serum containing buffer (Superblock) – PBS, 4% (w/v) whey protein (BiPro USA), 15% normal goat serum (Invitrogen), 0.5% Tween 20, and 0.05% sodium azide (Sigma-Aldrich) – inhibited binding of glycan-dependent FDG mAbs to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, whereas positive control RBD-binding mAb D001 bound the spike protein in the presence of superblock. ELISAs using superblock were previously described ( Williams et al., 2017a 110. Williams, L.D. ∙ Ofek, G. ∙ Schätzle, S. ... Potent and broad HIV-neutralizing antibodies in memory B cells and plasma Sci. Immunol. 2017; 2 :eaal2200 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, whereas the 2G12 from Polymun bound to S protein in surface plasmon reasonance, it was less potent than the recombinantly expressed 2G12 Abs, and did not bind well in ELISA; commercial 2G12 from Polymun was provided in a maltose (mannose) buffer. D-mannose more competitively inhibited binding to fungal glycans by some FDG Abs. For example, SHIV-elicited DH898 mAbs were not outcompeted for binding as much as vaccine-induced DH717 mAbs. These data suggested that FDG Abs have differences in affinities for free-glycans in solution compared to glycan clusters on HIV-1 Env or the promiscuity in binding different glycoforms. In fact, structural analysis of DH898 mAbs in complex with recombinant HIV-1 Env trimers showed that DH898 mAbs bound glycans at two different epitopes on HIV-1 Env ( Figures 4 and S3 ). These data suggested that DH898 mAbs have a higher propensity to bind different glycan arrangements on HIV-1 Env and not only the high mannose patch where the vaccine-induced DH717 Abs, SHIV-induced DH851 bnAbs and 2G12 have been shown to bind.
mAb neutralizing activity was assessed in TZM-bl cells as described ( Montefiori et al., 2012 68. Montefiori, D.C. ∙ Karnasuta, C. ∙ Huang, Y. ...

Env -pseudotyped HIV-1 bearing Envs used in SHIVs for infection were referred to as autologous viruses, whereas viruses bearing Envs from global panels of geographically diverse multi-clade strains were referred to as heterologous viruses. Difficult-to-neutralize or tier 2 autologous or heterologous HIV-1 isolates are generally used to assess neutralization potency and breadth of HIV-1 Abs; global panel of HIV-1 strains ( deCamp et al., 2014 24. deCamp, A. ∙ Hraber, P. ∙ Bailer, R.T. ... Global panel of HIV-1 Env reference strains for standardized assessments of vaccine-elicited neutralizing antibodies J. Virol. 2014; 88 :2489-2507 Crossref Scopus (153) PubMed Google Scholar ) and119 heterologous tier 2 isolates ( Seaman et al., 2010 92. Seaman, M.S. ∙ Janes, H. ∙ Hawkins, N. ... Tiered categorization of a diverse panel of HIV-1 Env pseudoviruses for assessment of neutralizing antibodies J. Virol. 2010; 84 :1439-1452 Crossref Scopus (463) PubMed Google Scholar ). Env -pseudotyped HIV-1 bearing Envs with Man 9 -enriched glycans (termed Kif-treated HIV-1 strains) were grown in cells treated with 25μM Kifunensine to facilitate high mannose glycan expression on HIV-1 Envs and Kif-treated HIV-1 strains were tested for neutralization in TZM-bl cells as previously described ( Saunders et al., 2017a 85. Saunders, K.O. ∙ Nicely, N.I. ∙ Wiehe, K. ... Vaccine Elicitation of High Mannose-Dependent Neutralizing Antibodies against the V3-Glycan Broadly Neutralizing Epitope in Nonhuman Primates Cell Rep. 2017; 18 :2175-2188 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ). Env -pseudotyped HIV bearing Envs with Man 9 -enriched glycans express Env expressed in cell lines, but it remains unknown how additional glycoforms present on the Env generated in vivo might impact the binding specificities and function of our FDG mAbs that preferentially target Man 9 -glycans. For neutralization assays, a mixture of CH01+CH31 bnAbs is used as a positive control for neutralization of all HIV-1 strains, and murine leukemia virus (MLv) or vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) were used as negative retrovirus controls. For neutralization assays, a positive for neutralizing antibody activity in a sample is based on the criterion of > 3X the observed background against the MLV negative control pseudovirus. Note that DH898 mAbs were tested for neutralization of all tier 2 HIV-1 strains in the global panel, except CNE8. Additionally, we found neutralization titer variabilities in DH851 mAbs across different batches of mAbs, in agreement with the unstable dimerization of Fabs for these Abs. Only DH1005 neutralized [Kif]-treated HIV strains ( Figure 3 ), but none of the human FDG mAbs (DH1005-DH1010) neutralized non-[Kif]-treated HIV-1 strains (not shown).
Recombinant mAbs were tested for binding glycans in an oligomannose bead immunoassay as described ( Saunders et al., 2017a 85. Saunders, K.O. ∙ Nicely, N.I. ∙ Wiehe, K. ... Vaccine Elicitation of High Mannose-Dependent Neutralizing Antibodies against the V3-Glycan Broadly Neutralizing Epitope in Nonhuman Primates Cell Rep. 2017; 18 :2175-2188 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ). Custom glycan microspheres were generated with different individual glycans to evaluate mAb binding. Binding of mAb to glycan was determined with A Bio-Plex 200 HTS (Bio-Rad) machine with the Bioplex manager software (Bio-Rad) was used to quantify binding of mAb to glycan, and binding was measured as background-subtracted fluorescence.
mAb reactivity to nine autoantigens was measured using the AtheNA Multi-Lyte ANA kit (Zeus scientific, Cat#A21101). MAbs were 2-fold serially diluted starting at 50 mcg/mL. The secondary antibody provided with the kit was Phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-human IgG. The kit SOP was followed for the remainder of the assay. Samples were analyzed using AtheNA software. Positive (+) specimens received a score > 120, and negative (-) specimens received a score < 100. Samples that score 100-120 were considered indeterminate. FDG mAbs that had ANA reactivity were shown in Figure 7 . The following mAbs were negative for autoantigen binding (not shown): DH851.2, DH717.1, DH717.3, DH1005-DH1008, and DH1010-DH1011.
Indirect immunofluorescence binding of mAbs to human epithelial (HEp-2) cells (ZEUS IFA ANA HEp-2 Test System, Zeus Scientific, Somerville, NJ) was performed per manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 20μL of diluted mAbs (50μg/ml, and 25μg/ml) were added to the appropriate wells on the antinuclear antibody (ANA) slide. Slides were incubated for 20 minutes at room temperature in a humid chamber, and then washed with 1X PBS. Goat Anti-Rhesus Ig(H+L) FITC secondary was added at a concentration of 30μg/ml to each well. The slides were incubated for 20 minutes, then washed twice, dried, fixed with 33% glycerol and coverslipped. Slides were imaged using an Olympus AX70 microscope with a SpotFlex FX1520 camera. Images were acquired on a 40X objective using the FITC fluorescence channel with different acquisition time as indicated on each image. Positivity was determined by comparing Abs of interest to positive and negative non-human primate antibody controls, DH1037 and DH570.30 respectively. Staining patterns were identified using the Zeus Scientific pattern guide found on the website and previously reported ( Buchner et al., 2014 15. Buchner, C. ∙ Bryant, C. ∙ Eslami, A. ...

Illumina MiSeq sequencing of Ab heavy chain VDJ sequences was performed on peripheral blood cells as previously described ( Zhang et al., 2016 118. Zhang, R. ∙ Verkoczy, L. ∙ Wiehe, K. ... Initiation of immune tolerance-controlled HIV gp41 neutralizing B cell lineages Sci. Transl. Med. 2016; 8 :336ra62 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Williams et al., 2017b 111. Williams, W.B. ∙ Zhang, J. ∙ Jiang, C. ... Initiation of HIV neutralizing B cell lineages with sequential envelope immunizations Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :1732 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, for each time point, RNA from peripheral cells was divided equally into two separate portions that were used to generate independent cDNA aliquots for sequencing to confirm the absence or presence of Ab sequences of interest. Paired-end sequences were merged using FLASH ( Magoč and Salzberg, 2011 63. Magoč, T. ∙ Salzberg, S.L. FLASH: fast length adjustment of short reads to improve genome assemblies Bioinformatics. 2011; 27 :2957-2963 Crossref Scopus (5236) PubMed Google Scholar ), quality filtered (Q score > 30 for > 95% of sequence) and deduplicated. V, D, and J gene segment, clonal relatedness testing and reconstruction of clonal lineage trees were performed using the Cloanalyst software package ( Kepler, 2013 50. Kepler, T.B. Reconstructing a B-cell clonal lineage. I. Statistical inference of unobserved ancestors F1000Res. 2013; 2 :103 Crossref Scopus (69) PubMed Google Scholar ). Immunogenetics information of rhesus and human antibody sequences were assigned by Cloanalyst using Cloanalyst’s default libraries of rhesus and human immunoglobulin genes, respectively ( https://www.bu.edu/computationalimmunology/research/software/ ). B cell clonality was determined based on similar heavy chain rearrangements and CDR3 length as described ( Kepler et al., 2014 51. Kepler, T.B. ∙ Munshaw, S. ∙ Wiehe, K. ... Reconstructing a B-Cell Clonal Lineage. II. Mutation, Selection, and Affinity Maturation Front. Immunol. 2014; 5 :170 Crossref Scopus (66) PubMed Google Scholar ). For Abs that were inferred as being clonally-related by Cloanalyst, and had the same V H sequence but different alleles, we manually inspected the V H sequence for similar residues in the HCDR3, including the non-templated nucleotides.
The near-germline or unmutated common ancestor (UCA) of Ab lineages were inferred using the Cloanalyst software program with the macaque immunoglobulin gene library. DH851UCA was initially inferred based on the isolation of DH851.1-DH851.3 lineage members. DH851UCA.2 was later inferred using DH851.1-DH851.4. We found that DH851UCA and DH851UCA.2 had one amino acid difference in a framework region of both the heavy and light chain genes; the UCA sequences were deposited in GenBank. Data shown in this study described the characteristics of DH851UCA. For recombinant Ab expression, week 0 mAbs had clonally-related heavy chain genes detected via NGS paired with DH851.1 light chain, while the DH851UCA had the Cloanalyst-inferred heavy and light chain genes.
To exclude the possibility of generating unmutated common ancestor Abs that do not account for the allelic variability observed in the RM model ( Ramesh et al., 2017 80. Ramesh, A. ∙ Darko, S. ∙ Hua, A. ... Structure and Diversity of the Rhesus Macaque Immunoglobulin Loci through Multiple De Novo Genome Assemblies Front. Immunol. 2017; 8 :1407 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ; Corcoran et al., 2016 20. Corcoran, M.M. ∙ Phad, G.E. ∙ Vázquez Bernat, N. ... Production of individualized V gene databases reveals high levels of immunoglobulin genetic diversity Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 :13642 Crossref Scopus (85) PubMed Google Scholar ), we generated a NGS dataset as described above that comprised only of VH1 (DH898 lineage), VH2 (DH851 lineage) and VH4 (DH717 lineage) IgM+ repertoires at baseline or week 0 of the RMs. Here, we sought to find unmutated or least mutated FDG Ab clonal lineage members indicated from macaque baseline PBMCs. Week 0 clonally-related mAbs were generated by pairing the week 0 NGS-derived heavy chain genes with the light chain of the single B cell-derived Ab isolated following infection or vaccination as described ( Williams et al., 2015 109. Williams, W.B. ∙ Liao, H.X. ∙ Moody, M.A. ... HIV-1 VACCINES. Diversion of HIV-1 vaccine-induced immunity by gp41-microbiota cross-reactive antibodies Science. 2015; 349 :aab1253 Crossref Scopus (116) PubMed Google Scholar ). Clonally-related DH717 V H genes identified via V H gene deep sequencing post the Star-Man 9 -V3 boost had higher average mutation frequencies compared to DH717 V H genes identified after the initial trimer boost. However, our attempts to express recombinant mAbs bearing the mutated DH717 V H genes paired with the DH717.1 V λ failed, so it remains unknown whether these mutations improved antibody function.
Week 0 DH898 and DH851 FDG lineage precursors that existed prior to SHIV CH848TF infection in macaque RM6163 were evaluated using NGS in two separate experiments. cDNA of isotype-specific VH1 and VH2 genes were amplified from peripheral blood-extracted RNA and split into separate samples for cDNA library preparation and NGS (Run A and B). Sequences were quality filtered and computationally analyzed, and DH898 and DH851 clonal lineages assessed using Cloanalyst software program. We found 2 IgG and 594 IgM DH898 clonal lineage members among ∼3.5 million unique V H 1 sequences at week 0; IgA (151760), IgG (860757), and IgM (2457675). We found 21 IgA, 66 IgG and 148 IgM DH851 clonal lineage members among ∼2.1 million unique V H 2 sequences at week 0; IgA (516938), IgG (1282669), and IgM (759778).
RM VDJ libraries were generated following the manufacturers protocol (Chromium Next GEM Single Cell V(D)J protocol (v1.1, Rev E)) with three modifications. First, 15 μl of cDNA was used as input for the first BCR enrichment (step 4.1a). Second, RM-specific reverse primers were used to amplify BCR transcripts (step 4.1b and 4.3a). Third, we used 9 PCR cycles in the first BCR enrichment (step 4.1) and 11 PCR cycles for the second BCR enrichment (step 4.3). Primers were designed to amplify the BCR sequences from RMs using the previously published macaque Ig libraries ( Ramesh et al., 2017 80. Ramesh, A. ∙ Darko, S. ∙ Hua, A. ... Structure and Diversity of the Rhesus Macaque Immunoglobulin Loci through Multiple De Novo Genome Assemblies Front. Immunol. 2017; 8 :1407 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ) and Cloanalyst default rhesus Ig library ( https://www.bu.edu/computationalimmunology/research/software/ ). Reverse primers were designed to sit in the constant region for all isotypes (IgA, IgG, IgE, IgM, IgD) and both light chains (IgK, IgL). First round primers (5′ to 3′) were as follows for IgA, IgG, IgE, IgM, IgD, IgK, and IgL are [IgA] GGCGGGAAGTTTATGACGGTC, [IgG] TTGTCCACCTTGGTGTTGCT, [IgE] ATGGAGTGTGCACCACAT, [IgM] CCTGCATGACATCCTTGGAAG, [IgD] AGGTGCCAGGTGACAGTC, [IgK] TGTCCTGCTCTGTGACACT, and [IgL] TGACCTGGCAGCTGTAGCT. Second round primers (5′ to 3′) were as follows [IgA] CTTTTGCTCCAGGTCACGT, [IgG] CACGCTGCTGAGGGAGT, [IgE] GTCACCATCACCGGCT, [IgM] GCCAACGGCCACTTCGTT, [IgD] GGTTGTACCCAGTTATCAAGCAT, [IgK] TCCACCTTCCACTTTACGCT, and [IgL] TAGCTGCTGGCYGC.
Illumina NGS-generated raw data files were processed using the Cell Ranger single cell gene expression software provided by 10X Genomics. Sequences were quality filtered, followed by assembly and annotation using Cell Ranger adapted to contain RM Ig genes from three reference libraries (the Cloanalyst default Ig library – see link above, IMGT, and Ramesh et al. [2017 80. Ramesh, A. ∙ Darko, S. ∙ Hua, A. ... Structure and Diversity of the Rhesus Macaque Immunoglobulin Loci through Multiple De Novo Genome Assemblies Front. Immunol. 2017; 8 :1407 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ]). In order to adapt Cell Ranger to contain rhesus Ig libraries, we manually compiled all three RM Ig reference libraries and reformatted them to be compatible with Cell Ranger as described ( https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-vdj/software/pipelines/latest/advanced/references#segment ). Next, an updated text file specifying the sequences of the RM inner enrichment primers (second round primers shown above) was compiled and formatted for compatibility with Cell Ranger as described in the documentation for running customized libraries in Cell Ranger that is provided by 10X Genomics. The customized RM Ig reference library described above and the file containing the inner enrichment primers were then used in Cell Ranger to build and annotate contigs. Contigs assembled by Cell Ranger were reannotated and analyzed using only the Cloanalyst software with default macaque Ig library to determine B cell immunogenetics and clonality.
For transcriptome analyses of macaque single B cells, the Cell Ranger Single Cell Software Suite (version 3.1) was used to generate sequencing fastq files and to perform sample de-multiplexing, barcode processing, reference alignment and single-cell 3′ gene counting ( Zheng et al., 2017a 119. Zheng, G.X. ∙ Terry, J.M. ∙ Belgrader, P. ... Massively parallel digital transcriptional profiling of single cells Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :14049 Crossref Scopus (1269) PubMed Google Scholar ). Reads were aligned to the RM genome (Mmul_10). Matrices of cell barcodes and gene counts generated by Cell Ranger were loaded into Seurat R package (v3.2.0) for graph-based cell clustering, dimensionality reduction and data visualization ( Macosko et al., 2015 62.

Comprehensive Integration of Single-Cell Data Cell. 2019; 177 :1888-1902.e21 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1448) PubMed Google Scholar ). Differentially expressed genes between cell clusters or groups were determined using Seurat by the Likelihood-ratio test ( McDavid et al., 2013 66. McDavid, A. ∙ Finak, G. ∙ Chattopadyay, P.K. ... Data exploration, quality control and testing in single-cell qPCR-based gene expression experiments Bioinformatics. 2013; 29 :461-467 Crossref Scopus (167) PubMed Google Scholar ).

The binding of DH717.1 and DH717.1 C76S mAbs to 5 different CH848 Env’s was assessed by surface plasmon resonance on Biacore T-200 (GE-Healthcare) at 25°C with HBS-EP+ (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, and 0.05% surfactant P-20) as the running buffer. The Abs were captured on a CM5 chip by flowing 200 nM of the mAb over a flow cell immobilized with ∼9000 RU of anti-human Fc antibody. Binding was measured by flowing over 200 nM solution of Env’s in running buffer. 2G12 was used as a control and it was immobilized on one of the flow cells. The surface was regenerated between injections by flowing over 3M MgCl 2 solution for 10 s with flow rate of 100 μl/min. Blank sensorgrams were obtained by injection of same volume of HBS-EP+ buffer in place of trimer solutions. Sensorgrams of the concentration series were corrected with corresponding blank curves.
The SPR binding curves of 2G12 and DH717.1 mAbs and Fabs against CH848 10.17 DS.SOSIP and CH848 10.17 DS.SOSIP_N133DN138T trimers were obtained using the Biacore S200 instrument (GE Healthcare) in HBS-N 1X running buffer. Biotinylated CH848 DS.SOSIP trimers were immobilized onto a CM3 sensor via streptavidin to a level of 300-350RU. The 2G12 and DH717.2 mAbs and Fabs were diluted down to 50μg/mL and injected over the SOSIP trimer at 30μL/min for 180 s. A blank streptavidin surface was used for reference subtraction to account for non-specific binding. SPR single cycle kinetic and affinity measurements of the 2G12 and DH717.1 mAbs and Fabs were also obtained using the Biacore S200 instrument with the CH848 DS.SOSIP trimers directly immobilized to a level of 300-350RU via streptavidin. Five sequential injections of DH717.1 mAb and 2G12 mAb diluted from 5nM to 50nM were injected over the immobilized CH848 DS.SOSIP trimers at a flow rate of 50uL/min for 120 s per injection. 2G12 Fab2 was injected from 50nM to 500nM and DH717.1 Fab dimer was injected from 250nM to 2000nM over the CH848 DS.SOSIP trimers. The dissociation length of the single cycle injections was 600 s followed by regeneration with a 20 s pulse of 25mM NaOH. Results were analyzed using the Biacore S200 Evaluation Software (GE Healthcare). A blank streptavidin surface as well as buffer binding were used for double reference subtraction to account for non-specific antibody binding and signal drift. Subsequent curve fitting analysis was performed using the 1:1 Langmuir model with a local Rmax for both 2G12 and DH717.1 mAb and the heterogeneous ligand model for 2G12 Fab2. The reported kinetic binding curves are representative of 2 datasets.
For affinity measurements, the DH717.1 Fab was purified using size exclusion chromatography (SEC-FPLC) in PBS 1x. Approximately 10mg of DH717.1 Fab was loaded onto a Superdex 200 increase 10/300 column using a 500 μL loop and run at 0.5 mL/min using an Äkta Pure system (GE Healthcare). DH717.1 Fab peaks were collected via fractionation using a 96-well plate and were analyzed using the Unicorn 7.0.2 software (GE Healthcare). Using a linear regression derived from running protein standards (GE Healthcare) of known molecular weight, the molecular weights of the Fab monomer and dimer peaks were estimated. The monomer and dimer peak fractions were then pooled and concentrated using 10k, 0.5mL centrifugal filters (Amicon) and concentrations were measured using a NanoDrop UV-VIS spectrophotometer. Following SEC purification, DH717.1 Fab monomer and dimer stability were assessed using SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis and re-analysis by SEC-FPLC. SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis was performed using the BioRad system and 4%–15% TGX stain free gels. 7μg of each DH717.1 Fab fragment was loaded onto the gel under both reducing and non-reducing conditions. 10μg of a Precision Plus Protein standard (BioRad) was also loaded to help verify the size of the fragments. The gel was run at 200V for 35-40 minutes in Tris/Glycine/SDS running buffer. The Fab bands were analyzed via the Gel Doc EZ imager (BioRad). For SEC-FPLC re-analysis, 40μg of each DH717.1 Fab monomer and dimer were loaded onto a Superdex 200 increase 10/300 column using a 100 μL loop and run at 0.5 mL/min using the aforementioned Äkta Pure system.
The binding FDG Abs to CoV spikes was assessed by surface plasmon resonance on Biacore T-200 (GE-Healthcare) at 25°C with HBS-EP+ (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, and 0.05% surfactant P-20) as the running buffer. For the data shown in Figure 6 E, S proteins were captured via their C-terminal Twin Streptactin tags at ∼1000 RU levels on two alternate flow cells of a streptavidin coated chip, and 200 nM of each FDG antibody was flowed over all four flow cells; the binding curves were double-reference subtracted. The surface was regenerated between injections by flowing over 1M NaCl in 50mM NaOH solution for 10 s with flow rate of 100μl/min.
For determining affinity and kinetics of 2G12 interaction with SARS-CoV-2 spike, single cycle kinetics analysis was performed on the SARS-CoV-2 S protein immobilized on a streptavidin (SA) chip with five injections of 2G12 Fab, prepared by digestion with papain as described previously ( Murin et al., 2014 70. Murin, C.D. ∙ Julien, J.P. ∙ Sok, D. ... Structure of 2G12 Fab2 in complex with soluble and fully glycosylated HIV-1 Env by negative-stain single-particle electron microscopy J. Virol. 2014; 88 :10177-10188 Crossref Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ), at 3.125 nM, 6.25 nM, 12.5 nM, 25 nM and 50 nM concentrations. The data were fit to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model.
DH717.1 IgG was expressed and purified as above. IgG samples were digested with papain and further purified to produce Fab fragment. DH717.1 Fab was purified via size exclusion chromatography to separate the Fab monomers and dimers. The DH717.1 Fab monomer was mixed with 3 molar excess of Man 9 -V3 at a final complex concentration of 15 mg/mL for crystallization trials. The complex crystallized over a 100 μl reservoir of 100mM Na Citrate, pH 5.0, 30% PEG 4000 in 1-2 days at room temperature. The DH717.1 Fab dimer, concentrated to 10 mg/ml in 0.1M HEPES buffer with 0.15M NaCl, was crystallized over a 60 μl reservoir of 0.1M citric acid pH 3.5, 14% PEG 1,000 in a drop composed of 0.5 μl protein plus 0.5 μl reservoir. The crystals were cryoprotected by brief immersion in reservoir solution supplemented with 25% glycerol for the DH717.1 Fab monomer-glycopeptide complex, and 30% ethylene glycol for the DH717.1 Fab dimer, before being flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data of the monomer-glycopeptide complex were collected at NE-CAT beamline 24-ID-E and data of dimer were collected at SER-CAT with an incident beam of 1 Å in wavelength. Data were processed using HKL-2000 ( Otwinowski and Minor, 1997 73. Otwinowski, Z. ∙ Minor, W. Processing of X-ray diffraction data collected in oscillation mode Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276 :307-326 Crossref Scopus (36257) PubMed Google Scholar ). Matthews analysis of the monomer-glycopeptide complex and dimer data suggested 1 Fab and four Fabs present in the unit cell, respectively ( Matthews, 1968 65. Matthews, B.W. Solvent content of protein crystals J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33 :491-497 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Molecular replacement calculations for the monomer-glycopeptide complex were carried out with PHASER, using published DH270.5 (Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID 5TTP) as the starting model. The Fab model was separated into its variable and constant domains for molecular replacement. A molecular replacement solution for the dimeric DH717.1 with four Fabs was found using Phaser with search models DH717.1 Fv (above) and the constant region from DH522 UCA ( Terwilliger et al., 2008 101. Terwilliger, T.C. ∙ Grosse-Kunstleve, R.W. ∙ Afonine, P.V. ... Iterative model building, structure refinement and density modification with the PHENIX AutoBuild wizard Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2008; 64 :61-69 Crossref Scopus (934) PubMed Google Scholar ; Williams et al., 2017b 111. Williams, W.B. ∙ Zhang, J. ∙ Jiang, C. ... Initiation of HIV neutralizing B cell lineages with sequential envelope immunizations Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :1732 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ). The solution was improved through alternating rounds of manual rebuilding in Coot and reciprocal space refinement in PHENIX, and geometry optimization using Rosetta-Phenix refinement (phenix.rosetta_refine) ( Emsley et al., 2010 32. Emsley, P. ∙ Lohkamp, B. ∙ Scott, W.G. ... Features and development of Coot Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :486-501 Crossref Scopus (13879) PubMed Google Scholar ; Adams et al., 2010 1. Adams, P.D. ∙ Afonine, P.V. ∙ Bunkóczi, G. ... PHENIX: a comprehensive Python-based system for macromolecular structure solution Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :213-221 Crossref Scopus (14149) PubMed Google Scholar ). The crystal structure of the monomeric DH717.1 Fab complex showed well-defined electron density for the three protein-proximal mannose residues, while the rest of the Man 9 glycan and the V3 peptide were disordered.
MAbs were diluted to 100 μg/ml final concentration with buffer containing 10 mM NaCl, 20 mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, 5% glycerol and 7.5 mM glutaraldehyde After 5-minute incubation, excess glutaraldehyude was quenched by adding sufficient 1 M Tris stock for a final Tris 75 mM for 5 minutes; then samples were stained with 2% uranyl formate. Images were obtained with a Philips 420 electron microscope operated at 120 kV, at 82,000 × magnification and a 4.02 Å pixel size. The RELION program was used for CTF correction, automatic particle picking and 2D class averaging of the single-particle images. For human FDG precursor recombinant mAbs, only DH1005, DH1009 and DH1010 showed a mixture of I- and Y- shaped conformations ( Figure 3 ); the remaining mAbs only showed Y-shaped Abs (not shown).
For the DH898.1-bound complex, purified HIV-1 Env was mixed with 6-fold molar excess of recombinantly expressed and purified DH898.1 Fab to obtain a final concentration of 1.5 mg/ml Env, and incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. 2.5 uL of protein was deposited on a Quantifoil-1.2/1.3 holey carbon grid (Electron Microscopy Sciences, PA) that had been glow discharged for 30 s in a PELCO easiGlow Glow Discharge Cleaning System. After a 30 s incubation in > 95% humidity, excess protein was blotted away for 2.5 s before being plunge frozen into liquid ethane using a Leica EM GP2 plunge freezer (Leica Microsystems). For the DH851 Abs, attempts to obtain a structure of the complex by mixing with Fabs that were either recombinantly produced or obtained by proteolytic digestion of the IgG were unsuccessful, yielding mostly unliganded Env trimer populations and very small fractions of Env bound to Fab dimer (not shown). We next prepared a complex of DH851.3 bound to HIV-1 Env amenable to structural analysis by first making a complex of the Env with DH851.3 IgG, which was purified by size exclusion chromatography. The purified complex was then subjected to proteolytic digestion with HRV3c protease that cleaved at a site engineered between the Fab and Fc regions. Following purification over a protein A column to remove the Fc, the complex was purified by SEC, and concentrated to 1.5 mg/ml. Cryo-EM grids were prepared in a manner similar to the DH898.1 complex.
Cryo-EM imaging was performed on a FEI Titan Krios microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific) operated at 300 kV, aligned for parallel illumination. Data collection images were acquired with a Gatan K3 detector operated in counting mode with a calibrated physical pixel size of 1.066 Å with a defocus range between −1.0 and −3.5 μm using the Latitude S software (Gatan Inc.). The dose rate used was ∼1.0 e-/Å 2 ·s to ensure operation in the linear range of the detector. The total exposure time was 4 s, and intermediate frames were recorded every 0.067 s giving an accumulated dose of ∼60 e-/Å 2 and a total of 60 frames per image. A total of 6058 and 3230 images were collected for the DH851.3- and DH898.1-bound complexes, respectively. Cryo-EM image quality was monitored on-the-fly during data collection using automated processing routines.
Data processing was performed within cryoSPARC ( Punjani et al., 2017 78. Punjani, A. ∙ Rubinstein, J.L. ∙ Fleet, D.J. ... cryoSPARC: algorithms for rapid unsupervised cryo-EM structure determination Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :290-296 Crossref Scopus (1000) PubMed Google Scholar ) including particle picking, multiple rounds of 2D classification, ab initio reconstruction, heterogeneous and homogeneous map refinements, and non-uniform map refinements.
For DH898.1 reconstructions, micrographs were imported into cryoSPARC, CTF-corrected, and manually curated to eliminate astigmatism or defocus outliers and micrographs with excessive ice contamination, yielding 2978 final micrographs. Particles were picked using Blob Picker on 500 micrographs with a minimum and maximum particle diameter of 150 and 250 Å for circular blobs, yielding 259,587 particles, which were extracted with a 320-pixel box size and subjected to 2D class averaging with 100 classes. From these, seven classes were chosen for template picking applied to the full final micrograph set, yielding 1,655,400 particles that were extracted with a 256-pixel box size and subjected to multiple rounds of 2D classification and manual selection, multi-class ab initio refinements and multi-class heterogeneous refinements to eliminate junk particles. Early rounds of analysis quickly identified three particle populations consisting of unliganded Env SOSIP trimer, SOSIP trimer with a single Fab dimer bound near the CD4-binding site (CD4bs), and Fab dimers either free or bound to a poorly resolved blob of the approximate size of an Env gp120 subunit. An intermediate stage hetero-refinement with 91,638 particles used eight starting models that included four CD4bs SOSIP-Fab dimer complexes, two unliganded SOSIP trimers, and two Fab-blob complexes. This refinement yielded two junk classes (4,440 particles total), two Fab-blob classes (13,160 particles total), one unliganded SOSIP class (18,058), two CD4bs classes (40,350 total particles), and a new class with a single Fab dimer bound near the V3 glycan supersite of the SOSIP trimer (15,630 particles). We then returned to an earlier, larger stack with 324,010 particles, and subjected this to a hetero-refinement using the unliganded SOSIP, the CD4bs complex and the V3 complex as starting models, which yielded unliganded SOSIP classes with 82,025 particles, and CD4bs-complex classes with 72,951 particles, and a V3-complex class with 21,502 particles. These particle stacks for the unliganded SOSIP and the CD4bs-complex were further cleaned to remove junk particles and yielded final reconstructions with 48,127 and 59,012 particles and achieving final global resolutions of 3.9 and 4.7 Å, respectively, as measured by cryoSPARC’s auto-masked, phase-randomized-corrected gold standard FSC calculation at the FSC 0.143 level. The map of the V3-complex class was used to generate ten 2D templates that were used to re-pick the micrographs, yielding 1,827,101 particles extracted with 320-pixel box size. This stack was subjected to 2D classification and manual selection, multi-class ab initio refinements and multi-class heterogeneous refinements to yield a final reconstruction at 6.1-Å resolution with 14,873 particles. Using cryoSPARC’s 3D Variability tool we noted substantial movement of the fab dimer relative to the SOSIP trimer in the CD4bs complex; therefore we performed particle subtraction and local refinements focused on the fab dimer of the CD4bs-complex and the V3-complex. The local refinements reported the same or slightly worse resolution compared to the homogeneous refinements; however, the density for the Fab dimer was better defined as judged by eye, particularly the appearance of beta-strands within the Fab dimer interface. Local resolution at the FSC 0.5 level was estimated for all final reconstructions and maps were locally filtered and sharpened at 1.5x the reported B-value from the final refinements. Images were created in UCSF Chimera.
For the movies of the DH898.1-bound complex, a homogeneous set of ∼122k particles were identified and re-extracted from the original dose-weighted micrographs using a binning factor 2. 3D classification in RELION ( Scheres, 2012 90. Scheres, S.H. RELION: implementation of a Bayesian approach to cryo-EM structure determination J. Struct. Biol. 2012; 180 :519-530 Crossref Scopus (2255) PubMed Google Scholar ) was performed imposing C1 symmetry and using different models generated by cryoSPARC as references for alignment. All models were low-pass filtered to 60 Å before refinement. For the binding site located around a CD4 binding site glycan cluster, we identified one class with 42,745 particles that was consistent with the cryoSPARC reference model and subjected them to further 3D auto refinement. After convergence, the refinement was continued with a soft shape mask and resulted in an overall structure at 6.4-Å resolution. To obtain higher resolution, multibody refinement ( Nakane et al., 2018 71. Nakane, T. ∙ Kimanius, D. ∙ Lindahl, E. ... Characterisation of molecular motions in cryo-EM single-particle data by multi-body refinement in RELION eLife. 2018; 7 :e36861 Crossref Scopus (145) PubMed Google Scholar ) was performed on the refined particles using two individual soft masks (one for the Fab dimer, another for the Env trimer) created with UCSF Chimera ( Pettersen et al., 2004 75. Pettersen, E.F. ∙ Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ... UCSF Chimera--a visualization system for exploratory research and analysis J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25 :1605-1612 Crossref Scopus (21900) PubMed Google Scholar ) and RELION. The overall resolution for the gp120 trimer portion reached 4.7 Å and for the Fab dimer the estimated resolution was 6.7 Å. At this point we switched to un-binned particles and repeated the same processing strategy, but without significant improvements. We then carried out focused refinement on the Env trimer component using the re-extracted particles and imposing C3 symmetry, which lead to an improved map at 4.3-Å resolution. Based on these refinement parameters, CTF-refine and Bayesian-polishing were performed on the particles. Another round of 3D auto refine was performed using the polished particles and the reference model of the entire complex (with a soft shape mask applied), resulting in an overall resolution of 4.8 Å. Multibody refinement was performed once again based on these updated refinements. The final resolution for the gp120 trimer after post-processing was 4.65 Å and 5.8 Å for the Fab dimer. For the V3-binding site, 17,510 particles were classified out using the V3-binding reference model generated by cryoSPARC. The first round of 3D auto refinement yielded an 8.14 Å resolution map, and multibody refinement resulted in a 7.6 Å map for the gp120 portion and 8.4 Å for the Fab dimer. Given the lower resolution of this refinement and the fewer number of particles compared with binding-site1, CTF-refine and Bayesian polishing were not used for this class. In order to visualize the principal motions present in the data identified by the multibody refinement procedure, we reconstructed intermediate volumes using different relative orientations of each body and produced movies using the ‘Volume Series’ tool from ChimeraX ( Goddard et al., 2018 38. Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ∙ Meng, E.C. ... UCSF ChimeraX: Meeting modern challenges in visualization and analysis Protein Sci. 2018; 27 :14-25 Crossref Scopus (764) PubMed Google Scholar ). Additional editing of the videos was performed with Movavi Video Editor (Movavi) to label the different components and provide visual aids.
For DH851.3 reconstruction, micrographs were imported into cryoSPARC and CTF-corrected. Particles were picked using Blob Picker on 500 micrographs with a minimum and maximum particle diameter of 125 and 250 Å for elliptical blobs, yielding 99,285 particles, which were extracted with a 384-pixel box size, down-sampled to 128 pixel box size, and subjected to 2D class averaging with 100 classes. From these classes, five were chosen for template picking applied to the full micrograph set, yielding 1,276,458 particles that were extracted with a 384-pixel box size and subjected to multiple rounds of 2D classification and manual selection, multi-class ab initio refinements and multi-class heterogeneous refinements to eliminate junk particles. Refinements that imposed C3 symmetry yielded ∼4.8-Å overall resolution, but at the expense of losing density in the constant domains, making it difficult to trace the elbow region to determine whether the Fab dimer was or was not domain-swapped. A 3D variability analysis confirmed that there was considerable flexibility within the constant domains, so the C3 refinement was not pursued further. The final non-uniform C1 reconstruction with 52,398 particles yielded a 5.6-Å overall resolution. Particle subtraction and local refinements focused on the Fab dimer did not improve resolution or the definition of the Fab dimer map, as judged by the lack of visible beta-strands.
Starting model for the CH848 SOSIP used for the DH898 complex was from PDB 6UM6 . Starting model for the CH5050 SOSIP used for the DH851 complex was a homology model built using PDB 5VN8 as a template by submitting the DH898 sequence to SWISS-MODEL ( Waterhouse et al., 2018 105. Waterhouse, A. ∙ Bertoni, M. ∙ Bienert, S. ... SWISS-MODEL: homology modelling of protein structures and complexes Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46 :W296-W303 Crossref Scopus (2629) PubMed Google Scholar ). Homology models for DH898 and DH851 Fabs were built with SWISS-MODEL using the top reported template. Intermediate models were generated from the starting models using Rosetta ( Song et al., 2013 94. Song, Y. ∙ DiMaio, F. ∙ Wang, R.Y. ... High-resolution comparative modeling with RosettaCM Structure. 2013; 21 :1735-1742 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (429) PubMed Google Scholar ) to rebuild 500-1000 new models into the cryo-EM maps and selecting the model with the best combination of Rosetta energy and fit to the map. The cryo-EM half maps of CH848 SOSIP trimer and DH898.1 Fab dimer were used to improve the maps using a density modification program ResolveCryoEM ( Terwilliger et al., 2020 102. Terwilliger, T.C. ∙ Ludtke, S.J. ∙ Read, R.J. ... Improvement of cryo-EM maps by density modification Nat. Methods. 2020; 17 :923-927 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ). The models were then fit manually in Coot ( Emsley et al., 2010 32. Emsley, P. ∙ Lohkamp, B. ∙ Scott, W.G. ... Features and development of Coot Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :486-501 Crossref Scopus (13879) PubMed Google Scholar ) following iterative refinement using Isolde ( Croll, 2018 22. Croll, T.I. ISOLDE: a physically realistic environment for model building into low-resolution electron-density maps Acta Crystallogr. D Struct. Biol. 2018; 74 :519-530 Crossref Scopus (126) PubMed Google Scholar ) and subsequent manual coordinate fitting in Coot. These models were rigid fit into DH898.1 fab dimer bound to CH848 SOSIP trimer complex map, and the interacting glycans were fit manually in Coot followed by refinement in Isolde. DH851 structure was fit manually in Coot followed by refinement in Isolde as well. Structure and map analysis was performed using PyMol and ChimeraX ( Goddard et al., 2018 38. Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ∙ Meng, E.C. ... UCSF ChimeraX: Meeting modern challenges in visualization and analysis Protein Sci. 2018; 27 :14-25 Crossref Scopus (764) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Purified SARS-CoV-2 spike preparations were diluted to a final concentration of ∼1 mg/mL in 2 mM Tris pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl and 0.02% NaN3, were mixed with 6-fold molar excess of 2G12 Fab and incubated for 2 hours at room tempearture. 2.5 uL of protein was deposited on a CF-1.2/1.3 grid that had been glow discharged for 30 s in a PELCO easiGlow Glow Discharge Cleaning System. After a 30 s incubation in > 95% humidity, excess protein was blotted away for 2.5 s before being plunge frozen into liquid ethane using a Leica EM GP2 plunge freezer (Leica Microsystems).
Cryo-EM imaging was performed on a FEI Titan Krios microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific) operated at 300 kV. Data were acquired with a Gatan K3 detector operated in counting mode using the Leginon system ( Suloway et al., 2005 98. Suloway, C. ∙ Pulokas, J. ∙ Fellmann, D. ... Automated molecular microscopy: the new Leginon system J. Struct. Biol. 2005; 151 :41-60 Crossref Scopus (889) PubMed Google Scholar ). The K3 experimental parameters are 2.5 exposure with 50 frames at 50 ms framerate with a total dose of 66.43 e-/A2 and a pixel size of ∼1.058 Å/px. This system was also energy-filtered with a slit width of 20 eV. A total of 6804 images were collected.
Cryo-EM image quality was monitored on-the-fly during data collection using automated processing routines. Individual frames were aligned and dose-weighted using MotionCor2 ( Zheng et al., 2017b 120. Zheng, S.Q. ∙ Palovcak, E. ∙ Armache, J.P. ... MotionCor2: anisotropic correction of beam-induced motion for improved cryo-electron microscopy Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :331-332 Crossref Scopus (1875) PubMed Google Scholar ) implemented within the Appion pipeline ( Lander et al., 2009 56. Lander, G.C. ∙ Stagg, S.M. ∙ Voss, N.R. ... Appion: an integrated, database-driven pipeline to facilitate EM image processing J. Struct. Biol. 2009; 166 :95-102 Crossref Scopus (503) PubMed Google Scholar ). Data processing was performed within cryoSPARC ( Punjani et al., 2017 78. Punjani, A. ∙ Rubinstein, J.L. ∙ Fleet, D.J. ... cryoSPARC: algorithms for rapid unsupervised cryo-EM structure determination Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :290-296 Crossref Scopus (1000) PubMed Google Scholar ) including particle picking, multiple rounds of 2D classification, ab initio reconstruction, heterogeneous and homogeneous map refinements, and non-uniform map refinements. Heterogenous classifications were performed within RELION ( Scheres, 2012 90. Scheres, S.H. RELION: implementation of a Bayesian approach to cryo-EM structure determination J. Struct. Biol. 2012; 180 :519-530 Crossref Scopus (2255) PubMed Google Scholar ) using masks produced in Chimera.
Structure of the all ‘down’ state (PDB ID 6VXX ) previously published SARS-CoV-2 ectodomain, and a structure of the 2G12 Fab bound to Man1-2 (PDB ID 6N35 ) were used to fit the cryo-EM maps in ChimeraX. Coordinates were then fit manually in Coot ( Emsley et al., 2010 32. Emsley, P. ∙ Lohkamp, B. ∙ Scott, W.G. ... Features and development of Coot Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :486-501 Crossref Scopus (13879) PubMed Google Scholar ) following iterative refinement using Isolde ( Croll, 2018 22. Croll, T.I. ISOLDE: a physically realistic environment for model building into low-resolution electron-density maps Acta Crystallogr. D Struct. Biol. 2018; 74 :519-530 Crossref Scopus (126) PubMed Google Scholar ) and subsequent manual coordinate fitting in Coot. Structure and map analysis was performed using PyMol and ChimeraX ( Goddard et al., 2018 38. Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ∙ Meng, E.C. ... UCSF ChimeraX: Meeting modern challenges in visualization and analysis Protein Sci. 2018; 27 :14-25 Crossref Scopus (764) PubMed Google Scholar ).
For sequence analysis of DH851 Abs (see Figure S4 ), 2G12 was used as a positive control, which has four hydrophobic residues participating in contacts within the Fab dimer interface ( Calarese et al., 2003 16. Calarese, D.A. ∙ Scanlan, C.N. ∙ Zwick, M.B. ... Antibody domain exchange is an immunological solution to carbohydrate cluster recognition Science. 2003; 300 :2065-2071 Crossref Scopus (646) PubMed Google Scholar ); heavy chain residues 19, 77, 79 and 81. Residue 81 in the heavy chain of 2G12 was considered hydrophobic, because the amphipathic glutamine (Q) side chain was participating in a π-N bond with the aromatic phenylalanine (F) residue 77 of the adjacent heavy chain ( Calarese et al., 2003 16. Calarese, D.A. ∙ Scanlan, C.N. ∙ Zwick, M.B. ... Antibody domain exchange is an immunological solution to carbohydrate cluster recognition Science. 2003; 300 :2065-2071 Crossref Scopus (646) PubMed Google Scholar ). The isoleucine (I) at position 19 is especially important, because a single mutation to arginine (R) at this position is sufficient to completely disrupt Fab-dimerization and domain-swapping in 2G12 ( Doores et al., 2010b 28. Doores, K.J. ∙ Fulton, Z. ∙ Huber, M. ... Antibody 2G12 recognizes di-mannose equivalently in domain- and nondomain-exchanged forms but only binds the HIV-1 glycan shield if domain exchanged J. Virol. 2010; 84 :10690-10699 Crossref Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar ). The 2G12 interface contains three rare interface residues (asterisks), which were not present in the germline sequence ( Huber et al., 2010 47. Huber, M. ∙ Le, K.M. ∙ Doores, K.J. ... Very few substitutions in a germ line antibody are required to initiate significant domain exchange J. Virol. 2010; 84 :10700-10707 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) and thus represent mutations acquired during antibody affinity maturation. In contrast to the I-shaped 2G12, the Y-shaped antibody VRC01 has only a single hydrophobic residue, no rare residues, and three charged residues in these positions, including an arginine at position 19. The three DH851 Abs that showed I-shaped, Fab-dimerized Abs, DH851.1 to DH851.3, have three or four hydrophobic interface residues, most of them rare, and no charged residues. In contrast, DH851.4 to DH851.6, DH851.8 and the DH851UCA have only a single hydrophobic interface residue and these Abs are all Y-shaped, similar to the negative control VRC01. For DH1003 lineage analysis (see Data S2 Q), the specific pattern of hydrophobic residues within the interface correlated with the phylogram branch points, as indicated in the last column, suggesting that evolution of the lineage correlated with Fab-dimerization; this hypothesis will be explored further in subsequent studies.
We used a statistical test to look for distribution shifts between two time points (week 105 and 145) and the DH717 lineage cells within the RMs were considered the unit of analysis ( Figure 2 A). The asterisk indicated significance at p < 0.0001, using a non-parametirc Wilcoxon test performed in SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). In ELISA ( Figures 2 , S2 , and S4 ), error bars represented the standard error of the mean (GraphPad Prism) for mAb binding levels that was generated from multiple independent assay.
