Title: An ancestral mycobacterial effector promotes dissemination of infection


Abstract: Summary

The human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis typically causes lung disease but can also disseminate to other tissues. We identified a M. tuberculosis ( Mtb ) outbreak presenting with unusually high rates of extrapulmonary dissemination and bone disease. We found that the causal strain carried an ancestral full-length version of the type VII-secreted effector EsxM rather than the truncated version present in other modern Mtb lineages. The ancestral EsxM variant exacerbated dissemination through enhancement of macrophage motility, increased egress of macrophages from established granulomas, and alterations in macrophage actin dynamics. Reconstitution of the ancestral version of EsxM in an attenuated modern strain of Mtb altered the migratory mode of infected macrophages, enhancing their motility. In a zebrafish model, full-length EsxM promoted bone disease. The presence of a derived nonsense variant in EsxM throughout the major Mtb lineages 2, 3, and 4 is consistent with a role for EsxM in regulating the extent of dissemination.

Section: Introduction

Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mtb ), the etiologic agent of the disease tuberculosis (TB), is a pathogen of critical public health importance. 1 1.

Here, we describe an unusual outbreak of Mtb with high rates of extrapulmonary dissemination and bone disease. We uncover a functional variant in the ESX-5 secreted effector EsxM that precisely coincides with a transition from the ancestral allele present in Mtb lineages 1, 5, 6, and 7 to a derived truncation allele in lineages L2– L4. The ancestral version of EsxM present in the outbreak strain, and generally in L1 strains, leads to alterations in the modality of infected host macrophage migration and the rate of egress of infected macrophages from granulomas. Mtb generally requires airborne lung-to-lung transmission, so we therefore propose that limiting the degree of dissemination to tissues outside the lung may be advantageous with respect to the likelihood of transmission. We infer that the stop codon in EsxM was introduced in the most recent common ancestor of the L2–L4 Mtb strains, leading to decreased rates of dissemination and skeletal disease for strains carrying this variant.

We investigated a TB outbreak with extremely high rates of disseminated and skeletal disease ( Figures 1 A and 1B). The index case, a man originally from Vietnam, was diagnosed with pulmonary TB after over a year of symptoms, and a contact investigation was carried out. 46 46.

Remarkably, though the reported frequency of skeletal disease is 2% of all US cases, 2 2. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Reported Tuberculosis in the United States, 2020 US Department of Health and Human Services, CDC, 2021 Google Scholar four of the extrapulmonary cases (57% of cases in the outbreak) had skeletal disease. The binomial probability of observing four or more bone cases among seven TB patients if the probability of each case having bone TB is equal to the population proportion is approximately 5×10 −6 . Two of the bone TB cases had a single site of disease in the spine, and the other two had diffuse bony disease involving the ribs, scapula, iliac crest, spine, and sternum ( Figures 1 C–1E). One of the patients with diffuse bone disease had concurrent pulmonary involvement but no other site, and the other had no site of disease outside the bones. All secondary case patients were US-born (one White, the rest Black), HIV-negative, genetically unrelated to the index case and each other, and seemingly otherwise immunocompetent. The strains isolated from each patient had identical genotypes by mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units-variable number tandem repeats (MIRU-VNTR) typing and spoligotyping, suggesting a single transmitting strain, which we refer to as NCG ( Figure S1 ).
Extant Mtb strains are generally classified by lineage, with so-called “ancestral” strains being from L1, and L5– L7 and so-called “modern” strains being from L2– L4. 4 4.

After removal of genes associated with drug-resistance and those found in repetitive regions of the Mtb genome (including PE/PPE and PE-PGRS genes), we used the remaining 31,839 SNPs to construct neighbor-joining and maximum-likelihood phylogenies that placed NCG among L1 strains, confirming the initial genotyping results ( Figure 2 A).
We next comprehensively assessed lineage- and strain-specific variants across the 225 strains ( Table S1 ). When we compared variants appearing in extant strains from the ancestral lineages (L1, and L5– L7) and modern lineages (L2, L3, and L4), we discovered an ancestral variant present in all L1, and L5– L7 strains (including NCG) in the gene encoding the putative secreted effector EsxM that had not been previously noted as specific to these lineages ( Figure 2 A and Table S1 ).

It has previously been characterized as a pseudogene in the H37Rv reference genome due to an early stop codon that truncates ∼40% of the protein. We found that the “ancestral lineage” Mtb strains (L1 and L5– L7), in contrast, contain the complete open reading frame and do not carry the early stop mutation ( Figure 2 A). The characteristic EsxM truncation identified in “modern” strains (L2– L4) occurs at codon position 59, upstream of the C-terminal regions implicated in secretion. 55 55.

Immun. 2011; 79 :4042-4049 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar but had not been explicitly associated with the L1 and L5–L7 lineages historically referred to as ancestral. We therefore asked whether the stop-loss variant in EsxM is the ancestral or the derived allele. Other members of the Mtb complex such as Mycobacterium bovis as well as closely related mycobacterial species, including Mycobacterium avium and M. marinum , share the stop-loss variant (glutamine residue at amino acid 59) with the ancestral lineage strains of Mtb. ( Figure 2 B). Therefore, we conclude that the full-length EsxM variant is ancestral, and the early-stop variant found in L2– L4 strains of Mtb is more recently derived.
Although not formally tested in large case-control studies, several epidemiological studies, while not definitive, have suggested that L1 strains carrying the ancestral allele present with higher rates of extrapulmonary disease. 15 15.

Using this dataset, we found that infection with L1 strains (full-length EsxM) was associated with bone disease (p = 0.0001, OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.6–4.0) compared to the lineages with the derived esxM allele (L2–L4) ( Table S2 ). Thus, we decided to examine the role of the full-length EsxM variant in dissemination and bone disease, as well as the regulation and function of EsxM in both Mtb and the closely related pathogen M. marinum.
Though the EsxM variant is a strong candidate for a functional variant due to the early stop codon, we considered whether close ESX-5 paralogs might compensate, leaving the organism functionally unchanged. To test this hypothesis computationally, we calculated if any of the close EsxM paralogs showed a change in their rate of evolution in the modern lineages, which would be consistent with subfunctionalization resulting in little or no overall functional change; however, we did not detect a significant change in the rate of evolution for any of these paralogs ( Table S3 ). Further arguing against this hypothesis of complementation between paralogs is that these paralogous loci are differentially regulated at the transcriptional level, 60 60.

Because EsxM/EsxN proteins and their paralogs have high levels of sequence homology, we sought to investigate the regulation of these loci in varying contexts, including conditions previously reported to alter ESX-5 transcription in Mtb. 60 60. Elliott, S.R. ∙ Tischler, A.D. Phosphate starvation: a novel signal that triggers ESX-5 secretion in Mycobacterium tuberculosis Mol. Microbiol. 2016; 100 :510-526 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar We developed a qRT-PCR-based assay targeting divergent sequences at the 5′ end of each esxM - and esxM -like paralog transcript for M. marinum and Mtb . In M. marinum , we found that although esxM was substantially expressed during growth in liquid cultures, two other esxM -like transcripts were more abundant ( Figure 2 C). Upon phosphate starvation, the relative expression of esxM increased and was exceeded by only one paralog ( Figure 2 C). However, EsxM became the clear predominant paralog during infection, both in cell culture and during infection of zebrafish larvae, a natural host ( Figure 2 C).
We applied the same strategy to bacterial RNA from Mtb to investigate whether infection-dependent upregulation of esxM is conserved. We analyzed two Mtb strains: H37Rv, a L4 strain containing the early stop codon in EsxM, and the L1 NCG outbreak strain. Paralleling results from M. marinum , esxM transcript was expressed substantially in broth cultures but was not the most abundant paralog for either strain ( Figure 2 D). RNA-seq-based analysis of both Mtb strains grown in broth validated our qRT-PCR assay, with concordant results in transcript levels between the two assays ( Figure S2 B).
To test whether esxM was differentially regulated during Mtb infection, we infected C57Bl/6J mice intravenously (i.v.) with each strain and extracted bacterial RNA from mouse lungs at 6 weeks post-infection. We found that Mtb esxM became the predominantly expressed paralog during in vivo infections, with a dramatic upregulation of the esxM transcript ( Figure 2 D) for both the L1 NCG outbreak strain and the L4 H37Rv strain. These results are also consistent with previously reported cell culture infection experiments using Mtb . 57 57. Holt, K.E. ∙ McAdam, P. ∙ Thai, P.V.K. ...

In humans, M. marinum infections are temperature limited but can often result in tenosynovitis and osteomyelitis. 64 64. Johnson, M.G. ∙ Stout, J.E. Twenty-eight cases of Mycobacterium marinum infection: retrospective case series and literature review Infection. 2015; 43 :655-662 Crossref Scopus (75) PubMed Google Scholar In zebrafish and other teleosts, M. marinum infections can disseminate widely, often with bone involvement. 65 65. Matthews, J.L. Common diseases of laboratory zebrafish Methods Cell Biol. 2004; 77 :617-643 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar To test the hypothesis that esxM promotes dissemination, we genetically disrupted esxM in M. marinum to study dissemination, particularly to bone, using the natural zebrafish host.
To first test the impact of EsxM on protein secretion, we grew the WT (full-length EsxM), ΔesxM, and the complemented strain (extra-chromosomal expression of esxM from the hsp60 promoter) in Sauton’s media in vitro . We performed mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis of the secreted protein fractions. Importantly, the deletion and restoration of EsxM did not have widespread impacts on the M. marinum secretome. EsxM itself was only detected in culture filtrates from the complemented (and overexpressed) strain, likely due to low levels of expression and/or regulation of secretion under standard conditions, consistent with the lower levels of transcription we identified in broth-grown cultures ( Table S4 ). However, we were able to detect EsxN, the putative secreted partner of EsxM, from wild-type WT M. marinum culture filtrates, and found that deletion of the EsxM partner resulted in the absence of secreted EsxN, a phenotype that was fully complemented upon restoration of EsxM ( Figure S2 C). In contrast, other ESX-5 substrates were secreted at similar or increased levels in the esxM mutants, suggesting that any phenotype observed was specific to EsxM and not an indirect consequence of a general ESX-5 secretion defect ( Figure S2 C and Table S4 ).
As additional confirmation that EsxM could be secreted, we examined the expression of a tagged, complementing version of EsxM introduced into WT or esxM mutants under both standard and low-phosphate conditions. For both WT and mutant bacterial strains, we observed robust secretion of EsxM, detectable in the culture filtrate under low phosphate conditions ( Figures S2 D and S2E), an in vitro condition under which ESX-5 components are also transcriptionally induced ( Figure 2 C). 60 60.

Early events of mycobacterial infection largely rely on macrophages infected with intracellular bacteria. We first sought to identify dissemination of WT M. marinum possessing an intact copy of esxM via the egress of infected macrophages from early granulomas, a mechanism by which mycobacteria disseminate within their host. 23 23.

Due to the site of infection, most initial granulomas form ventrally. Intravital time-lapse experiments with longitudinal imaging over 15 h between 4 and 5 dpi captured trafficking of infected macrophages from nascent granulomas to sites above the midline, where dorsal granulomas can be established ( Figure 3 A and Video S1 ).

Macrophages are shown in red. M. marinum is shown in blue. Total time is 225 min
To quantitate dissemination to distal points, we measured the rate at which infection spread above the midline ( Figure 3 A). We found that WT M. marinum (EsxM full-length) disseminated to the dorsal side of the larval zebrafish midline in ∼70% of samples by 5 days post-infection (dpi) ( Figures 3 B and 3C). In contrast, ΔesxM mutants displayed a 2-fold reduction in dorsal dissemination ( Figures 3 B and 3C). The mutant could be complemented through constitutive extra-chromosomal expression of esxM ( Figures 3 B and 3C).
We observed no significant difference in bacterial burden in ΔesxM at the 5 dpi time point ( Figure S3 A), indicating that the initial dorsal dissemination phenotype is not a downstream effect of decreased overall burden. We also asked, using a slightly lower starting dose, whether overexpression of esxM in a WT M. marinum strain could enhance rates of dissemination; we observed a trend toward increased dissemination, although this was not statistically significant ( Figure S3 B). Overall, these experiments suggest that modulation of bacterial EsxM levels is associated with dissemination of infection to new sites and tissues.
Although we observed macrophages infected with EsxM-expressing M. marinum disseminating at a higher rate, this could arise through non-cell-autonomous effects of EsxM expression—for example, changing the overall inflammatory environment within the granuloma. To address this possibility, we co-infected larval zebrafish with differentially labeled WT and ΔesxM M. marinum and assessed dissemination from granulomas composed of mixed infected macrophages in equal proportions . Importantly, individual macrophages within the granuloma contained only one strain or the other, enabling testing of cell-autonomous effects. In mixed granulomas, granuloma macrophages infected with ΔesxM bacteria egressed at a dramatically lower rate than adjacent macrophages infected with WT M. marinum ( Figures 3 D–3F and Video S2 ). Thus, the esxM macrophage dissemination phenotype appears to be cell autonomous, suggesting local intracellular modulation of the infected host cell.

To assess whether secreted EsxM might directly modulate macrophage-mediated dissemination, we examined whether EsxM expression was sufficient to alter macrophage migration behavior and motility in the absence of any other bacterial proteins or lipids. In cultured mammalian macrophages, we found that cells heterologously expressing full-length EsxM from Mtb migrated through transwell membranes across a gradient at a higher rate than control macrophages in the presence of chemokines ( Figure 3 G).
To investigate macrophage behavior in response to a defined inflammatory stimulus, we performed zebrafish larval tail fin transections and measured recruitment of macrophages to the wound site. To understand the role of full-length EsxM in macrophage migration, we created a set of transgenic zebrafish lines that expressed bacterial EsxM ( M. marinum EsxM, codon optimized for expression in zebrafish) from a macrophage-specific promoter ( Tg ( mfap4:esxM-p2a-tdTomato xt49 )) ( Figures 4 A and 4B). Macrophages producing EsxM arrived at the wound after tail transection much faster and in greater numbers than control macrophages from a matched macrophage transgenic line expressing only the fluorophore ( Figures 4 C–4E and Video S3 ). We also found that esxM -expressing macrophages demonstrated an elevated maximum migration velocity compared to control macrophages ( Figure 4 F). As an additional control, we generated a transgenic line that drove macrophage-specific expression of the truncated EsxM found in modern lineages of Mtb ( Tg ( mfap4:esxM_Q59X-p2a-tdTomato xt50 )). These macrophages behaved similarly to controls ( Figures 4 C–4F and Video S3 ). As a control for the function of other ESX-secreted proteins, we created a transgenic line in which the paralogous protein EsxB from the ESX-1 locus was driven in macrophages ( Tg ( mfap4:esxB-p2a-mNeonGreen xt51 )). EsxB-expressing macrophages were indistinguishable from WT macrophages in these assays ( Figures S3 C and S3D).

We returned to our mixed granuloma model to assess the effects of EsxM on macrophage motility in a natural infection. We assayed the velocity of zebrafish macrophages infected with WT or ΔesxM M. marinum as they departed granulomas. ΔesxM -infected macrophages departed established granulomas at a much lower rate overall , and the subset of ΔesxM- infected macrophages that did depart migrated at a lower velocity ( Figures 3 D and S3 E). Overall, a strikingly low number of ΔesxM- infected macrophages departed established granulomas in the mixed infection experiments ( Figure 3 D).
To gain further insight into the observed cell-autonomous effect of EsxM on migration velocity, we measured the migration velocity of infected macrophages not in granulomas during the mixed infection. Here, we also observed a significant decrease in the migrating velocity of ΔesxM- infected macrophages compared to those infected with WT M. marinum , despite an overall higher rate of migration velocity relative to macrophages within granulomas ( Figure S3 F). Together, these results suggest that full-length EsxM is both required and sufficient for characteristic alterations in macrophage behavior, including egress from the initial granulomas that form during infection.
We next determined whether EsxM could enhance the migratory behavior of its primary host cell type in the context of infection with Mtb . We reconstituted the ancestral protein in an attenuated modern L4 Mtb strain. Using mc 2 6020, a double deletion ( ΔlysAΔpanCD ) auxotrophic mutant from the H37Rv background 66 66.

We found that RAW 264.7 macrophages infected with full-length esxM -expressing mc 2 6020 migrated directionally in a transwell assay at a higher rate than cells infected with control mc 2 6020, both in a serum gradient and in the presence of chemokines ( Figure 5 A). These results indicate that full-length, ancestral esxM expressed in a L4 Mtb strain promotes mammalian host cell migration during Mtb infection. During these experiments, we observed that the ancestral EsxM-expressing strain induced a distinct morphology of the infected macrophages compared to control infections, with the emergence of increased numbers of membrane spikes resembling filopodia ( Figure S4 A).
To explore this phenotype further in a human cell line, we used BLaER1 cells that, after transdifferentiation into macrophage-like cells, recapitulate critical aspects of macrophage biology. 67 67.

Similar to the result in RAW 264.7 cells, infection of the human macrophage cell line with Mtb expressing ancestral EsxM resulted in increased filopodial protrusions ( Figures 5 B and 5D). In addition, transdifferentiated BLaER1 cells infected with Mtb expressing ancestral EsxM took on a more extended morphology relative to those infected with the control Mtb strain ( Figures 5 C and 5D).
To characterize EsxM-dependent macrophage alterations more fully, we performed electron microscopy on infected macrophages from the Mtb mc 2 6020 strain with the control plasmid or the mc 2 6020 strain expressing ancestral, full-length EsxM. We found dramatic differences at the macrophage surfaces. Macrophages infected with the control strain had easily recognizable lamellipodia and prominent membrane ruffling, whereas those infected with Mtb expressing ancestral EsxM instead displayed prominent filopodia and extensive membrane blebs at the edge of the infected macrophage ( Figure 5 E).
These alterations closely resembled those described for a macrophage-specific knockout of Arpc2 in mouse macrophages. 69 69. Rotty, J.D. ∙ Brighton, H.E. ∙ Craig, S.L. ...

To examine how the differences we observed influence migration, we performed live imaging of transdifferentiated BLaER1 macrophages infected with the two Mtb strains that differ only in the expression of full-length EsxM. The leading edge of macrophages infected with the control Mtb strain displayed classical lamellipodia and ruffles that predicted the direction of movement ( Figure 6 A). In contrast, prominent filopodial projections marked the leading edge of the cells infected with Mtb expressing ancestral EsxM ( Figure 6 A). Thus, ancestral EsxM is required and sufficient in a variety of contexts to alter macrophage migratory dynamics and subsequent mycobacterial dissemination.
To confirm that the reconstitution experiments reflect the biology of the outbreak strain itself, we performed BLaER1 macrophage infections with cerulean-labeled versions of the L4 strain H37Rv and the NCG outbreak strain. Although we were not able to perform macrophage motility assays under BSL3 conditions, we found that cells infected with the NCG strain displayed similar alterations in morphology, with more extended branches than H37Rv-infected cells ( Figures 6 B, 6C, and S4 D).
We next explored in vivo whether this altered macrophage motility might contribute to the outbreak’s clinical phenotype using a zebrafish infection model. 72 72.

Common diseases of laboratory zebrafish Methods Cell Biol. 2004; 77 :617-643 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar We infected the osteoblast reporter line Tg(Ola.Sp7:mCherry-Eco.NfsB) pd46 and examined M. marinum -induced pathology in zebrafish bone.

Microbiology spectrum. 2017; 5 Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar We found that infection with M. marinum led to an increased signal from osteoblasts near sites of M. marinum infection and erosion of bone in contact with mycobacterial infection ( Figure 7 A–7B′).
We next developed an osteoclast-specific transgenic line using upstream regulatory sequences of the zebrafish tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase gene ( Tg(acp5a:mNeonGreen-CAAX ) xt52 ), which labeled osteoclasts specifically ( Figure 7 C). Using a dual osteoblast-osteoclast transgenic line derived from crossing the two lines, we infected zebrafish at 3 weeks post-fertilization (wpf) and traced the dissemination of M. marinum to skeletal sites two weeks later ( Figures 7 D and 7E). We found consistent and substantial dissemination of infection to bone at this time point ( Figures 7 D–7F). At sites of spinal infections in juvenile zebrafish, we noted a strong response by proximal osteoclasts and osteoblasts alike. Osteoclasts near M. marinum appeared in greater number and altered morphology ( Figure 7 E). Despite the close developmental relationship between macrophages and osteoclasts, we did not find any evidence of osteoclasts infected with M. marinum .
Finally, we infected juvenile zebrafish intraperitoneally with WT, ΔesxM , and the complemented mutant at 3 wpf and assessed the presence of spinal infections at 2 weeks post-infection (wpi). Although juvenile zebrafish infected with WT M. marinum developed spinal infections in ∼70% of samples by 2 wpi, this proportion was reduced to ∼20% in ΔesxM infections ( Figures 7 D–7F). The mutant could be complemented through constitutive extra-chromosomal expression of esxM ( Figures 7 D–7F).

Section: Discussion

Investigation of outbreak strains with extreme phenotypes can lead to mechanistic understanding of critical host-pathogen interactions that promote or restrain virulence and transmission. Here, we link an unusual Mtb outbreak with high rates of dissemination and skeletal disease to a specific Mtb -secreted effector that is present in the so-called “ancestral” lineages but truncated in major Mtb lineages L2–L4, the most broadly distributed lineages geographically.
Full-length EsxM is both necessary and sufficient to drive in vivo changes in the motility of infected macrophages, rates of granuloma egress and dissemination, and ultimately interaction with bone. Notably, reintroduction of the full-length EsxM into a modern Mtb strain resulted in a change in the migration modality of infected macrophages. Generally, lamellipodia at the leading edge are associated with macrophage migration within interstitial tissues. 83 83. Barros-Becker, F. ∙ Lam, P.Y. ∙ Fisher, R. ... Live imaging reveals distinct modes of neutrophil and macrophage migration within interstitial tissues J. Cell Sci. 2017; 130 :3801-3808 Crossref Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar In cells infected with an Mtb strain expressing reconstituted ancestral EsxM, a dramatic reprogramming of macrophage motility occurred, from lamellipodia-led migration to motility marked by filopodia at the leading edge and membrane blebbing. We hypothesize that ancestral and generalist mycobacterial pathogens benefit from dissemination via enhanced macrophage motility, and that the derived truncation of EsxM in L2–L4 curtails overall dissemination to some degree.
Our finding that the L2–L4 Mtb strains contain a derived, truncated version of EsxM suggests its functional change would have significantly altered their properties during human infection. Infection of non-transmissible tissue sites such as bone would not promote transmission. 84 84. Blaser, M.J. ∙ Kirschner, D.

Some additional properties of L2– L4 strains relative to L1 strains are likely attributable to a characteristic deletion present in L2– L4 strains associated with resistance to oxidative stress and hypoxia. 10 10.

We find that the ancestral version of this protein present in L1, and L5– L7 strains, as well as almost all pathogenic mycobacterial species, enhances macrophage motility—reprogramming macrophage migration in infected cells—and promotes dissemination. Results analyzing intrahost strain evolution from human autopsy studies have suggested similar patterns of intra-lung spread and inter-organ spread, indicating that there may be shared dissemination mechanisms, including macrophage trafficking. 93 93.

Though we identified a strong association between the full-length ancestral esxM allele and bone disease and identified a functional role for this effector using animal models, there are likely other bacterial variants or host factors that contribute to the extremely high rates of bone disease in the North Carolina outbreak. In addition, the in vivo regulation of the ESX-5 small, secreted proteins is complex. esxM becomes the predominant transcribed paralog in cell culture and animal models of infection, both in M. marinum and Mtb, but our evolutionary analysis also revealed strong conservation of other esxM paralogs ( Table S3 ) compared to published whole genome analysis of the overall rate of Mtb evolution. 48 48.

All zebrafish husbandry and experiments were approved by the Duke University Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol A091-20-04). Mouse studies were performed in strict accordance using the recommendations from the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institute of Health and the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare. Mouse studies were performed at Duke University using protocols approved by the Duke Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) (protocol A221-20-11) in a manner designed to minimize pain and suffering in M. tuberculosis -infected animals. Any animal that exhibited severe disease signs was immediately euthanized in accordance with IACUC approved endpoints.
Approval was obtained from the Duke University Medical Center Institutional Review Board to obtain the NCG isolate and to use deidentified clinical data for preparation of the manuscript. The index case was male; the outbreak comprised of three female patients and four male patients, with ages ranging from 25 to 55 years old. Detailed sex and age information is contained in Figure 1 A.
Zebrafish were maintained on a 14 h light/10 h dark cycle. Water conditions within the system were maintained at 28°C between pH 7.0–7.3 and conductivity 600–700 μS. Zebrafish were fed twice per day—once per day with dry food and once per day with Artemia .
All zebrafish strains used were in the ∗ AB wildtype background. Zebrafish experiments were performed with the approval of the Duke University Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol A091-20-04).

Male C57BL/6J were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (#0664). All mice were housed in a specific pathogen-free facility under standard conditions (12h light/dark, food and water ad libitum ). Mice were infected with Mtb between 8 and 12 weeks of age. All mice were male.
For in vivo experiments, 1x10 6 CFU of prepared H37Rv or NCG strains were delivered via i.v. tail vein injection, resulting in an infectious dose (Day 1 CFU) of 10 5 in the spleen and 10 4 in the lung. Groups of 3–4 mice per bacterial strain were infected. At 6 weeks post-infection, mice were euthanized, and organs were harvested then homogenized in a FastPrep-24 (MP Biomedicals). Bacterial burden was quantified by dilution plating half the organ on 7H10 agar and counting colony forming units (CFU) after three weeks of growth. The other half of the lung was placed in trizol, homogenized and frozen until RNA extraction.

Culture supernatants were double filtered with Steriflip-GP 0.22 μm filters (EMD Millipore) and concentrated ∼100–fold using Centricon Plus – 70, 3 kDa molecular weight cut-off centrifugal filters (Millipore). Proteins from the culture supernatants were then precipitated using 10% trichloroacetic acid overnight at 4°C and the pellets were washed twice with ice-cold acetone at maximum RPM. The pellets were then resuspended in 250 μL of extraction buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl – pH 7.5, 6% SDS, and 5 mM EDTA) with cOmplete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich). For cell lysate preparation, bacterial pellets were dissolved in 2 mL of extraction buffer with the protease inhibitor cocktail and lysed using 0.7 mm zirconia beads (BioSpec Products). The lysate was then separated from the cellular debris by centrifugation at maximum RPM. The culture filtrate and cell lysate protein concentrations were quantified using the DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad).
For immunoblot analysis, 30 μg of culture filtrates and cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to the PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad). The membranes were probed with rabbit α-HA-Tag (C29F4, Cell Signaling Technology, 1:1000 dilution) and mouse α-RNAP (8RB13, BioLegend, 1:5000 dilution) overnight at 4°C followed by 1 h incubation at room temperature with appropriate secondary antibodies (goat- anti -rabbit (1:5000 dilution), goat- anti -mouse (1:2500 dilution) conjugated with HRP, Thermo Scientific). After brief incubation with Super-Signal West Pico PLUS (Thermo Scientific) or Super-Signal West Femto maximum sensitivity Substrate (1:3 dilution, Thermo Scientific), the blots were exposed to Carestream Kodak Biomax MR film (Sigma-Aldrich) for signal detection.
Mtb H37Rv and NCG grown in Middlebrook 7H9 media were harvested at an OD 600 of 1 and the pellets were resuspended in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). The suspended bacterial pellets were then lysed using 0.7 mm zirconia beads as described previously. Subsequently, bacterial RNA was isolated using the Direct-zol RNA Miniprep kit (Zymo Research) and treated with RNAse-free DNAse I (NEB). Library prep using Illumina Stranded Total RNA Prep Ligation with Ribo-Zero Plus (Illumina) was performed by the Duke Center for Genomic and Computational Biology (GCB). The prepared libraries were subsequently sequencing using the NextSeq 500 High-Output platform to generate 75 bp single-end reads.
Transcript abundances were quantified using Kallisto v0.48 113 in single-end mode, with an estimated fragment length of 250 and a SD of 35, and sequence based bias correction. H37Rv cDNA was used as the index for pseudoalignment. Visualization of the data was done in RStudio using Sleuth v0.30.0. 110 110. Pimentel, H. ∙ Bray, N.L. ∙ Puente, S. ...

Drug resistance-associated mutations and genes in repetitive regions (PE/PPE and PGRS) of the genome were discarded, resulting in 31,839 SNPs used for phylogenetic analysis. For lineage analysis, we included SNPs from these regions (35,787 total) since a portion likely represent true variation among global strains.
The reads aligned to esxM were inspected manually for every strain included in the initial analysis. Furthermore, the 27 base pair sequence that includes the invariant sequence 10 bp upstream and 14 bp downstream of the TAG stop codon in esxM was searched in the fastq files of every isolate included in the initial analysis shown in Figure 2 , where the sequence was only found in isolates from the so-called “modern” lineages.
All trees were based on genome-wide SNPs derived according to the parameters specified above. A superset of SNPs was constructed for each strain with reference alleles occupying sites for which no variants were detected using custom Perl scripts. These SNPs informed neighbor-joining and maximum-likelihood methods of phylogeny construction. Neighbor-joining methodology was implemented with ClustalW2 using pairwise similarity scores of SNP supersets as a measure of genetic distance. 124 124. Thompson, J.D. ∙ Gibson, T.J. ∙ Higgins, D.G.

Macrophage migration following partial tail transection was tracked in ImageJ using the MTrackJ plugin. Quantitation of cell culture BLaER1 results was performed using automated plugin “Analyze Particles …” for Circularity as well as blinded analysis of filopodia frequency.
For Arpc2 cellular distribution analysis, cells were analyzed in ImageJ using in-house Jython scripts. Briefly, macrophage differentiated BLaER1 cells were infected with M. tuberculosis mc 2 6020 expressing either full-length EsxM or the mCerulean fluorescent protein. These were imaged singly at 100x, maximum intensity projected, and then a cellular outline is calculated from a channel that is well-distributed across the cell body (in this case, β-actin). This outline is then used to mask the cell and clear any external background. These cells are then visualized in the 3D Surface Plot plugin in FIJI/ImageJ, where the longest X axis is identified and the cells arranged in the XZ orientation along that axis. Smoothing is applied (value = 8.5 in this analysis) and all axes are removed and the background is changed to black before exporting to a static 2D image, which is then used for quantitation by scanning for >0 pixels on a binarized image and writing those coordinates to a.csv, which can then be further analyzed in R. The analysis in R consists of identifying the maximum Y coordinate at each pixel and using that to calculate the area under the curve for each cell across a defined interval of the cell (in percent X distance). Here, our analysis compared the edge 25% of the AUC for each condition, normalized to the AUC for that cell in the middle 50% (25–75%). This allows comparison of the distal/central fluorescence intensity ratio for each cell, which is then plotted in ggplot2. The script allows for arbitrary numbers of cells to be analyzed and compared at once, provided each cell is given a discrete identifier.
Cells were maximum-intensity projected and then the isolated using the “Analyze Particles …” function. The area outside of the cell was cleared and then the cells were visualized individually using “3D Surface Plot.” These plots were used to identify the longest axis along the cell and then exported to black background RGB images that were then binarized in 8-bit and each data-containing pixel was captured to .csv files. These files were then processed in R to identify the maximum outline of the curves and then the areas under the curve were calculated for each individual cell for a given interval, which were then compared using a t test.
Fold-change data were determined by the ratio of the average of triplicate measurements from the LFQ proteomics data ( Table S4 ). % Coefficient of variation were determined. The propagated average CV for the entire dataset was 8.04% and 8.02% for Δ esxM /WT and Complemented/WT respectively. In cases where protein abundance was significantly determined in one sample (eg WT) but missing in another we limited these values to 2′8 fold-change, the approximate dynamic range of the experiment. Significance was determined using Welsh’s modified T test; multiple testing was performed using the Benjamini-Hochberg with an alpha of 0.05. Corrected critical vales were p = 0.0164, and 0.0200 for Δ esxM /WT and Complemented/WT respectively. Samples were performed in biological duplicate.
Statistical tests utilized for each experiment are indicated in the figure legends.
