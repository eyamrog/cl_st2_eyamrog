Title: Guide RNA Categorization Enables Target Site Choice in Tn7-CRISPR-Cas Transposons


Abstract: Summary

CRISPR-Cas defense systems have been coopted multiple times in nature for guide RNA-directed transposition by Tn7-like elements. Prototypic Tn7 uses dedicated proteins for two targeting pathways: one targeting a neutral and conserved attachment site in the chromosome and a second directing transposition into mobile plasmids facilitating cell-to-cell transfer. We show that Tn7-CRISPR-Cas elements evolved a system of guide RNA categorization to accomplish the same two-pathway lifestyle. Multiple mechanisms allow functionally distinct guide RNAs for transposition: a conventional system capable of acquiring guide RNAs to new plasmid and phage targets and a second providing long-term memory for access to chromosomal sites upon entry into a new host. Guide RNAs are privatized to be recognized only by the transposon-adapted system via sequence specialization, mismatch tolerance, and selective regulation to avoid toxic self-targeting by endogenous CRISPR-Cas defense systems. This information reveals promising avenues to engineer guide RNAs for enhanced CRISPR-Cas functionality for genome modification.

Section: Introduction

CRISPR-Cas systems are widespread in bacteria and archaea, providing an efficient defense system from predation from bacteriophages and the burden imposed by other mobile elements ( Makarova et al., 2020 24. Makarova, K.S. ∙ Wolf, Y.I. ∙ Iranzo, J. ... Evolutionary classification of CRISPR-Cas systems: a burst of class 2 and derived variants Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2020; 18 :67-83 Crossref Scopus (1370) PubMed Google Scholar ). CRISPR-Cas systems have also been repurposed in nature for other functions that benefit from programmable guide RNA-based sequence recognition ( Faure et al., 2019a 12. Faure, G. ∙ Makarova, K.S. ∙ Koonin, E.V. CRISPR-Cas: Complex Functional Networks and Multiple Roles beyond Adaptive Immunity J. Mol. Biol. 2019; 431 :3-20 Crossref Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ). One compelling collection of systems involves multiple occasions where a specialized class of transposons, called Tn7-like elements, has co-opted different CRISPR-Cas systems for guide RNA-targeted transposition ( Faure et al., 2019b 13. Faure, G. ∙ Shmakov, S.A. ∙ Yan, W.X. ... CRISPR-Cas in mobile genetic elements: counter-defence and beyond Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2019; 17 :513-525 Crossref Scopus (184) PubMed Google Scholar ; Peters et al., 2017 37. Peters, J.E. ∙ Makarova, K.S. ∙ Shmakov, S. ... Recruitment of CRISPR-Cas systems by Tn7-like transposons Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :E7358-E7366 Crossref Scopus (185) PubMed Google Scholar ). Beyond providing an intriguing example of the propensity of evolution to mix and match useful functions, these systems have also been repurposed in the laboratory as promising tools for genome modification ( Klompe et al., 2019 21. Klompe, S.E. ∙ Vo, P.L.H. ∙ Halpin-Healy, T.S. ... Transposon-encoded CRISPR-Cas systems direct RNA-guided DNA integration Nature. 2019; 571 :219-225 Crossref Scopus (369) PubMed Google Scholar ; Strecker et al., 2019 43. Strecker, J. ∙ Ladha, A. ∙ Gardner, Z. ... RNA-guided DNA insertion with CRISPR-associated transposases Science. 2019; 365 :48-53 Crossref Scopus (400) PubMed Google Scholar ). Multiple questions remain regarding the basic function of Tn7-CRISPR-Cas elements, especially how they interact with canonical CRISPR-Cas systems.
The largest group of Tn7-CRISPR-Cas elements adapted a specific subtype of CRISPR-Cas systems in the type I-F group for guide RNA-directed transposition ( Peters, 2019 35. Peters, J.E. Targeted transposition with Tn7 elements: safe sites, mobile plasmids, CRISPR/Cas and beyond Mol. Microbiol. 2019; 112 :1635-1644 Crossref Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ). Canonical type I-F CRISPR-Cas systems, called type I-F1 systems, use four proteins (Cas8, Cas5, Cas7, and Cas6) as an effector complex called cascade to mature pre-crRNAs transcribed from a CRISPR array into functional guide RNA complexes. The repeats in the CRISPR array encode the guide RNA handles that are bound by Cas proteins, whereas target specificity is encoded in the spacers. Cas1 and Cas2 are proteins found across CRISPR-Cas systems for acquiring new spacers (also called adaptation) that are inserted into one end of the array adjacent to a special leader region. Type I CRISPR-Cas systems degrade targets recognized by the system using a helicase-nuclease protein, Cas3. Tn7-CRISPR-Cas elements derived from the canonical I-F1 systems are called I-F3 systems ( Makarova et al., 2020 24. Makarova, K.S. ∙ Wolf, Y.I. ∙ Iranzo, J. ... Evolutionary classification of CRISPR-Cas systems: a burst of class 2 and derived variants Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2020; 18 :67-83 Crossref Scopus (1370) PubMed Google Scholar ). I-F3 Tn7-CRISPR-Cas systems lack Cas3, and the Cas8 and Cas5 proteins are naturally fused. Tn7-CRISPR-Cas elements lack a spacer acquisition system and must collect new targeting information in trans using Cas1-2 functions borrowed from canonical CRISPR-Cas systems.
Prototypic Tn7 is known for the control it has over target site selection using five element-encoded proteins to direct transposition into a specific neutral chromosomal attachment ( att ) site or mobile genetic elements capable of cell-to-cell transfer ( Waddell and Craig, 1988 47. Waddell, C.S. ∙ Craig, N.L. Tn7 transposition: two transposition pathways directed by five Tn7-encoded genes Genes Dev. 1988; 2 :137-149 Crossref Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ). The core machinery used for all transposition involves a heteromeric transposase, TnsA+TnsB, for the breaking and joining functions that underlie transposition, which is controlled by a AAA+ regulator protein, TnsC ( Bainton et al., 1991 2. Bainton, R. ∙ Gamas, P. ∙ Craig, N.L. Tn7 transposition in vitro proceeds through an excised transposon intermediate generated by staggered breaks in DNA Cell. 1991; 65 :805-816 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (132) PubMed Google Scholar , 1993 3. Bainton, R.J. ∙ Kubo, K.M. ∙ Feng, J.-N. ...

Sci. 1998; 23 :486-490 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ). TnsABC must function with one of two target site selection proteins: TnsD/TniQ or TnsE. Tn7 transposition mediated by the sequence-specific DNA binding protein TnsD/TniQ allows high-frequency transposition into its att site downstream of the glmS gene. TnsD/TniQ recognizes the coding region of the essential and highly conserved glmS gene, ensuring a place for the transposon to integrate in a new bacterial host ( Mitra et al., 2010 28. Mitra, R. ∙ McKenzie, G.J. ∙ Yi, L. ... Characterization of the TnsD-attTn7 complex that promotes site-specific insertion of Tn7 Mob. DNA. 2010; 1 :18 Crossref Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ). Tn7 or diverged families of Tn7-like elements with homologs of TnsABCD have been identified in 10%–20% of sequenced bacteria, but in the diverged families, the TnsD/TniQ protein evolved new DNA binding specificities to recognize a wide variety of new att sites ( Peters, 2019 35.

Recruitment of CRISPR-Cas systems by Tn7-like transposons Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :E7358-E7366 Crossref Scopus (185) PubMed Google Scholar ). TnsABC from prototypic Tn7 also functions with the element-encoded protein TnsE to recognize plasmids capable of cell-cell transfer to facilitate transfer of the element between bacteria ( Parks et al., 2009 31.

We present a comprehensive bioinformatic analysis of I-F3 Tn7-CRISPR-Cas elements that reveals mechanisms that allowed evolution of guide RNA-directed transposition involving categorization of guide RNAs. This updated analysis indicates that all I-F3 Tn7-CRISPR-Cas insertion events are explained by guide RNAs encoded in CRISPR arrays within the element. A form of curation allows the I-F3 elements to maintain different classes of guide RNAs to mirror the two-pathway lifestyle found with prototypic Tn7, but with a guide RNA-only system. Guide RNA-directed transposition into the chromosome occurs via CRISPR arrays that are under control of a specialized transcriptional regulation system that directs pathway choice or using an atypical CRISPR repeat structure that allows the guide RNA to be private to the Tn7-CRISPR-Cas transposon. Guide RNAs encoded by the elements that recognize the chromosome also have mismatches that are tolerated for directing transposition but not for interference by a canonical I-F1 system. The guide RNA attributes found in I-F3 Tn7-CRISPR-Cas elements help explain how they interact with related type I-F CRISPR-Cas systems, such as the ability to tolerate self-targeting guide RNAs that would otherwise cause canonical CRISPR-Cas systems to degrade the host chromosome.

Section: Results

We conducted an updated bioinformatics analysis of the I-F3 family of Tn7-CRISPR-Cas elements ( Peters, 2019 35. Peters, J.E. Targeted transposition with Tn7 elements: safe sites, mobile plasmids, CRISPR/Cas and beyond Mol. Microbiol. 2019; 112 :1635-1644 Crossref Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ; Peters et al., 2017 37. Peters, J.E. ∙ Makarova, K.S. ∙ Shmakov, S. ... Recruitment of CRISPR-Cas systems by Tn7-like transposons Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :E7358-E7366 Crossref Scopus (185) PubMed Google Scholar ). An analysis of over 53,000 genomes from gammaproteobacteria identified 802 Tn7-like elements that encode the type I-F3 CRISPR-Cas system found in two branches ( Figure 1 ). One branch, I-F3a, primarily uses attachment sites adjacent to the yciA and guaC (IMPDH) genes. Elements in a second branch, I-F3b, are primarily found in an attachment site downstream of the ffs gene encoding the RNA component of the signal recognition particle and a minor branch with elements residing downstream of the rsmJ gene. As part of this analysis, we re-examined CRISPR arrays and made a striking finding that altered our understanding of how transposition is targeted across all of the I-F3 elements. We can show that the insertion position of all elements can be explained by guide RNA-directed transposition; for essentially all of the I-F3 elements, we can identify a spacer within element-encoded CRISPR arrays that matches a region ∼48 bp from the right end of the element ( Figures 1 , 2 A, and 2B; Table S1 ). In each of these cases, the spacer in the array matches the same protospacer in the yciA , guaC , ffs , or rsmJ genes ( Figure 2 B). In addition to being at one of the ends of the gene to direct transposition just outside of the reading frame, the spacers matching the yciA , guaC , and rsmJ genes are all found in the same reading frame register that aligns the variable wobble position of the codons with every sixth position in the guide RNA, a position known to flip out and not required to match the protospacer ( Fineran et al., 2014 14. Fineran, P.C. ∙ Gerritzen, M.J. ∙ Suárez-Diez, M. ... Degenerate target sites mediate rapid primed CRISPR adaptation Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111 :E1629-E1638 Crossref Scopus (205) PubMed Google Scholar ; Jackson et al., 2014 18. Jackson, R.N. ∙ Golden, S.M. ∙ van Erp, P.B. ... Structural biology.

Zhao, H. ∙ Sheng, G. ∙ Wang, J. ... Crystal structure of the RNA-guided immune surveillance Cascade complex in Escherichia coli Nature. 2014; 515 :147-150 Crossref Scopus (145) PubMed Google Scholar ). Around 6% of Tn7-CRISPR-Cas insertions identified in bacterial genomes are not located in one of the four major att sites ( Table S1 ). However, even with the insertions outside of the major att sites, we could still identify a spacer in the array that was specific to a protospacer ∼48 bp from the right end of the element ( Figure 1 ).
Of additional interest, the spacers that recognize each of the four major att sites are located in a specific position in the element-encoded CRISPR array(s). There are obvious trends with this position and the configuration of the CRISPR arrays that differed in the two major branches of I-F3 elements. In the branch of I-F3a elements, the spacer that matched the yciA or guaC att sites was located after a 70- to 90-bp gap in the array found immediately downstream of the tniQ , cas8/5 , cas7 , and cas6 operon ( Figures 2 A and 2C; see below). In these cases, where the CRISPR array was not contiguous, it was not clear whether the array was transcribed as a single pre-crRNA and/or whether all of the spacers were capable of being matured into functional guide RNA complexes (addressed below). In the I-F3b branch of elements that recognizes att sites associated with the ffs and rsmJ genes, the att -site-specific spacer tended to be found in the single CRISPR array located downstream of the tniQ-cas operon but always as the last spacer in the array ( Figures 1 and 2 A).
Only one transposition event was identified in a plasmid rather than in the chromosome in our analysis. The Tn7-CRISPR-Cas element in Aeromonas salmonicida S44, Tn6900, was on a large plasmid (pS44-1) that is predicted to be mobile based on the presence of genes with known roles in conjugal DNA transfer ( tra genes). Transposition into the site on the plasmid could still be explained by a guide RNA encoded in the array; however, in this case, the spacer was at the leader-proximal position in the array ( Figures S1 A–S1C). Interestingly, a near-identical Tn7-CRISPR-Cas element, Tn6899, found in the ffs att site in Aeromonas hydrophila AFG_SD03 ( Boehmer et al., 2018 4. Boehmer, T. ∙ Vogler, A.J. ∙ Thomas, A. ... Phenotypic characterization and whole genome analysis of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing bacteria isolated from dogs in Germany PLoS ONE. 2018; 13 :e0206252 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ), had a spacer that recognized the same plasmid-encoded gene but at a different position (Figures S1B and S1C), suggesting a possible plasmid vector important for dispersal of these elements within Aeromonas .
In addition to their distinct position in the CRISPR array, the att spacers were flanked by repeats with novel sequences. New spacers are added to a CRISPR array at the leader-proximal end of the array in a process that duplicates the leader-proximal repeat ( Xiao et al., 2017 50. Xiao, Y. ∙ Ng, S. ∙ Nam, K.H. ... How type II CRISPR-Cas establish immunity through Cas1-Cas2-mediated spacer integration Nature. 2017; 550 :137-141 Crossref Scopus (99) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, although repeats can diverge over time, the first and second repeats start out identical in CRISPR arrays. In I-F3 Tn7-CRISPR-Cas elements, the terminal spacer that was used for guide RNA-directed transposition into the chromosome was invariably flanked by repeats that were highly diverged from the leader-proximal repeat ( Figure 2 C; Table S1 ). We call the highly diverged repeats atypical repeats and a guide RNA formed from these sequences atypical guide RNAs.
To help us understand the unique nature of the CRISPR array structure found in I-F3 Tn7-CRISPR-Cas elements, we established guide RNA-directed transposition in a heterologous and genetically tractable system, E. coli . Elements identified in a plasmid in Aeromonas salmonicida S44 and in the ffs attachment site in Aeromonas hydrophila AFG_SD03 were of particular interest because they were nearly identical but found in different species at distinct insertion points, suggesting that they were recently functional ( Figure S1 A). For the transposition (Tns) and Cas proteins, we utilized a coding sequence configuration we predicted to be active for transposition by looking for consensus across multiple elements found in Aeromonas .
Previous studies trying to establish Tn7-CRISPR-Cas transposition in a heterologous host relied heavily on indirect PCR-based techniques to assess transposition, techniques that are vulnerable to artifacts ( Rice et al., 2020 39. Rice, P.A. ∙ Craig, N.L. ∙ Dyda, F. Comment on “RNA-guided DNA insertion with CRISPR-associated transposases” Science. 2020; 368 :eabb2022 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ; Strecker et al., 2020 44. Strecker, J. ∙ Ladha, A. ∙ Makarova, K.S. ... Response to Comment on “RNA-guided DNA insertion with CRISPR-associated transposases” Science. 2020; 368 :eabb2920 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ). To get a complete picture of Tn7-CRISPR-Cas transposition, we used an assay that monitored full transposition events. A mini Tn7-CRISPR-Cas element was situated in the chromosome, the donor site for transposition in our assays, constructed with cis -acting transposon end sequences predicted by putative TnsB-binding sites ( Peters, 2014 34. Peters, J.E. Tn7 Microbiol. Spectr. 2014; 2 :1-20 Google Scholar ) flanking an antibiotic resistance determinant. In this assay, candidate transposition targets resided on a conjugal F plasmid. After inducing expression of the components of the guide RNA-directed transposition system, full transposition events were detected by mating the conjugal plasmid into a tester strain and screening for the antibiotic resistance gene in the mini transposon ( Figure S2 A). The tnsABC , tniQ-cas8/5,7,6 , and the CRISPR array were expressed from three separate expression vectors.
Initially, we analyzed candidate guide RNAs produced from the wild-type configuration of the CRISPR array found in Tn6900 in A. salmonicida S44. In this configuration, the leader-proximal spacer was a perfect match to a mobile plasmid-encoded gene from the native host, and the second/terminal spacer had a degenerate match to the ffs protospacer with 10 mismatches ( Figure 3 A; Figure S1 C). Some of the mismatches between the spacer and the protospacer in the target were at every sixth position and, therefore, would not affect recognition of the ffs guide RNA target ( Figure S1 C). Monitoring transposition following expression of the native array configuration confirmed that functional guide RNAs were produced from the spacer with the canonical repeat structure at the leader-proximal position and the terminal spacer flanked by highly diverged atypical repeats ( Figure 3 B). Interestingly, guide RNA-mediated transposition occurred at a higher frequency with the ffs -specific spacer even though it contained mismatches and was flanked by atypical repeats ( Figure 3 B).
To test the individual contributions of the spacer, protospacer, and repeat sequences, we designed CRISPR array constructs with leader-proximal (typical) or terminal (atypical) flanking repeats as a single guide RNA expression construct and individually tested various native and synthetic spacer sequences. Not only were the guide RNAs with the atypical repeats functional, but they also consistently allowed a higher frequency of transposition compared with the typical repeat when tested with three different spacers ( Figure 3 C). Additionally, the ffs -specific spacer showed a higher frequency of transposition than the spacer directed at the plasmid target even though the plasmid spacer had a perfect match to its target and the ffs spacer had 10 mismatches to its target (several that were not at the sixth positions that are predicted to be flipped out) ( Figure 3 C). Altering the native ffs -specific spacer so that it was a perfect match to the ffs protospacer consistently allowed a modestly higher frequency of transposition ( Figures 3 C and 3D).
Guide RNA complexes were also designed using spacers matching different positions in lacZ ( Figures 3 D and 3E). We found that transposition frequency varied as much as 10-fold with different spacers even though the sequences recognized had the same candidate PAM sequence, a result that was not explained by the DNA strand that was targeted in the highly expressed lacZ gene ( Figures 3 D and 3E). However, regardless of the spacer tested, a modestly higher transposition frequency was found consistently with guide RNAs with the atypical repeats compared with typical repeats in the Tn7-CRISPR-Cas system from A. salmonicida S44 ( Figures 3 C and 3D). These experiments confirmed that a functional guide RNA complex could be produced from atypical repeats and hinted that the functionality of these complexes may show important differences from typical repeats. We found that multiple different positions could also be targeted in the E. coli chromosome using guide RNA-directed transposition, supporting the view that this is not a plasmid-specific process ( Figures S1 D and S1E).
Our experiments suggested that the guide RNA produced from atypical repeats was functional and appeared to allow enhanced transposition activity with the system derived from the Tn6900 element in A. salmonicida S44. To get a better understanding of the relevance of differences in the repeat sequences, we compared the sequences of the leader-proximal typical repeats with the atypical repeats flanking the terminal spacers to look for common trends across the two branches ( Figure 4 A). In both branches, there were common trends in the final repeat encoding the 3′ handle of the guide RNA with a tendency to lose the typical GTG (positions 1–3), a loss of conservation of the region cleaved from the final guide RNA (positions 21–28), and a general enrichment for adenines in the loop ( Figure 4 A). Functional differences from changes with the typical and atypical repeats were examined with Tn6900 by making changes to the repeat regions encoding the 5′ and 3′ handles of guide RNAs ( Figure 4 B). Although not subject to an extensive analysis, changing the GUG region to an AUU in the 3′ handle of a typical repeat (typical ∗ ) or changing the AUU to a GUG in the atypical repeat (atypical ∗ ) resulted in only small changes to the frequency of guide RNA-directed transposition ( Figure 4 B), suggesting that these conserved positions are not alone responsible for the atypical repeat frequency advantage and that a more complicated interdependency is at play.
Previous work with a different I-F3 Tn7-CRISPR-Cas systems found with the Tn6677 element from Vibrio cholerae HE-45 indicated that guide RNA complexes could be directed to programmed target sites in E. coli using guide RNAs ( Klompe et al., 2019 21. Klompe, S.E. ∙ Vo, P.L.H. ∙ Halpin-Healy, T.S. ... Transposon-encoded CRISPR-Cas systems direct RNA-guided DNA integration Nature. 2019; 571 :219-225 Crossref Scopus (369) PubMed Google Scholar ). The Tn6677 element is in the I-F3a branch of elements and provided a good point of comparison for understanding differences between the two branches of I-F3 Tn7-CRISPR-Cas elements ( Figure 1 ). Tn6677 naturally resides in the att site downstream of guaC , and, consistent with the trends we identified above, this element carries the att site targeting spacer in a noncontiguous array with an atypical repeat structure ( Figure 2 ). The Tns, Cas, and CRISPR array modules from Tn6677 were constructed under lactose and arabinose expression systems and tested in the transposition assay used for the Tn6900 derivative above ( Figure S2 A). We found that transposition into the native guaC attachment site used by Tn6677 required the guaC -specific guide RNA encoded in the array and that the atypical repeats in Tn6677 were also functional ( Figure 4 C). However, unlike the Tn6900 derivative, a similar frequency of transposition was found with the typical and atypical arrays ( Figure 4 C) or with modest changes in the typical and atypical repeats with the Tn6677 element ( Figure 4 D). Naturally occurring Tn7-like and Tn7-CRISPR-Cas elements control the left-to-right orientation with which they insert. Consistent with previous work, Tn6677 seemed to be somewhat relaxed for orientation control ( Figure S2 B; Klompe et al., 2019 21. Klompe, S.E. ∙ Vo, P.L.H. ∙ Halpin-Healy, T.S. ... Transposon-encoded CRISPR-Cas systems direct RNA-guided DNA integration Nature. 2019; 571 :219-225 Crossref Scopus (369) PubMed Google Scholar ). The Tn6900 derivative showed the expected bias for one orientation found with canonical Tn7 and found naturally when 24 independent insertions were analyzed ( Figure S2 B). Tn6900 derivative insertions were ∼48 bp from the protospacer and occurred with the target site duplication expected with full transposition ( Figure S2 C).
A question not addressed previously with Tn7-CRISPR-Cas systems involves possible cross-talk between CRISPR arrays with other type I-F CRISPR-Cas systems. If the CRISPR array from a Tn7-CRISPR-Cas element with the guide RNAs specific to the chromosome could be used by a standard I-F1 system, then the chromosome att site would be a target for degradation. This could limit the spread of I-F3 Tn7-CRISPR-Cas elements when it enters a new host that encodes a standard I-F1 CRISPR-Cas system. We investigated whether the typical and atypical guide RNAs encoded in the I-F3 CRISPR arrays could be accessed by a I-F1 system ( Chowdhury et al., 2017 6. Chowdhury, S. ∙ Carter, J. ∙ Rollins, M.F. ... Structure Reveals Mechanisms of Viral Suppressors that Intercept a CRISPR RNA-Guided Surveillance Complex Cell. 2017; 169 :47-57.e11 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (159) PubMed Google Scholar ). In our work testing the P. aerigunosa system, we co-expressed the Cas proteins and a single-spacer CRISPR array with a T7 expression system ( Vorontsova et al., 2015 46. Vorontsova, D. ∙ Datsenko, K.A. ∙ Medvedeva, S. ... Foreign DNA acquisition by the I-F CRISPR-Cas system requires all components of the interference machinery Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43 :10848-10860 Crossref Scopus (72) PubMed Google Scholar ). Repeats from the type I-F1 system from P. aerigunosa , the type I-F3a V. cholerae Tn6677 system, or the type I-F3b system derived from A. salmonicida Tn6900 were examined using a transformation efficiency assay examining plasmids with and without a protospacer. In control experiments, we observed robust interference using the I-F1 CRISPR-Cas system from P. aeruginosa PA14 ( Figure 5 ). Transformation was decreased over three orders of magnitude with the plasmid encoding a protospacer compared with a plasmid that lacked the protospacer. Similarly, the typical repeats of the I-F3 systems from Tn6677 and Tn6900 also allowed robust interference with the plasmid transformation assay when they contained an exact match to the protospacer in the plasmid. This was not unexpected because the repeats from the canonical I-F1 and I-F3 Tn7-CRISPR-Cas systems are similar ( Figure S3 ), and it is likely that the I-F3 Tn7-CRISPR-Cas systems rely on standard I-F1 systems for spacer acquisition.
We also tested the tolerance for mismatches in the I-F1 interference system based on the observation that mismatches were common in the att site guide RNAs found in the Tn7-CRISPR-Cas systems ( Table S1 ). Although the native mismatches had little or no effect on the ability to function for guide RNA-directed transposition with the Tn6900 derivative with 10 mismatches ( Figure 3 C) and Tn6677 element with 7 mismatches ( Figure 4 C), these same guide RNAs had a profound effect on interference with the I-F1 CRISPR-Cas system from P. aeruginosa PA14, allowing no observable interference in the transformation assay ( Figure 5 ). This indicates a form of privatization where mismatches with the guide RNA have a minimal or no effect on guide RNA-directed transposition; they are rendered unusable by the I-F1 system tested in our work.
We also determined whether the specialized atypical guide RNAs can be used by a canonical I-F1 system. When a spacer was situated with atypical repeats from the I-F3b system found with the Tn6900 derivative, guide RNA complexes formed with atypical repeats were reduced drastically in their ability to function for interference in the plasmid transformation assay, even with a perfect spacer-protospacer match ( Figure 5 ). The compromised use with the atypical repeats for interference was in contrast to the enhanced use we found for guide RNA-directed transposition with the I-F3b system ( Figures 3 and 4 ). This result indicates a second mechanism that would allow chromosomal targeting spacers to be tolerated in hosts with standard I-F1 CRISPR-Cas systems by allowing them to remain private to the I-F3b system. This privatization was absent in the Tn6677 I-F3a system from V. cholerae . With the I-F3a Vc system, robust interference was found with the typical repeats or the highly diverged atypical array from this element. However, the results below suggest that I-F3a Tn7-CRISPR-Cas elements can use a separate transcription network to help tolerate self-targeting spacers.
To better understand I-F3 Tn7-CRISPR-Cas element dissemination, we searched for genes conserved among diverse members of this group. Some of the other genes found conserved across I-F3 Tn7-CRISPR-Cas elements were predicted Xre-family transcriptional regulators. The xre gene resides at a conserved position between the tnsABC and tniQ-cas8/5,7,6 operons in nearly all I-F3 elements ( Figure 2 A). Although each of the two branches of I-F3 elements has xre genes, the predicted regulatory gene in each branch segregated with phylogenetically distinct families of controller (C) proteins associated with restriction-modification systems. I-F3a elements have a 68-amino-acid Xre protein related to C. Ahd I, and I-F3b elements have an ∼100-amino-acid Xre protein related to C. Csp 231I ( Figure S4 A). Candidate regulatory features could also be identified with the tniQ-cas and CRISPR arrays based on homology with the previously established systems ( Figure S4 B; see below; Streeter et al., 2004 45. Streeter, S.D. ∙ Papapanagiotou, I. ∙ McGeehan, J.E. ... DNA footprinting and biophysical characterization of the controller protein C.AhdI suggests the basis of a genetic switch Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32 :6445-6453 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We analyzed putative promoter regions in I-F3a elements and discovered candidate sites for Xre-mediated regulation upstream of xre as well as directly upstream of the att -targeting spacer in Tn6677 and other members of this branch of elements ( Figure 6 A). The regulatory regions were confirmed in vitro with two elements in the I-F3a branch, V. cholerae HE-45 Tn6677 (Vc) and V. parahaemolyticus RIMD221063 (Vp) ( Figure 6 C). A functional role of this interaction was shown by a LacZ reporter assay. Xre was found to autoregulate its own pXre promoter, which allowed minimal transcription without Xre, and was activated by low amounts of Xre and repressed as the expression of Xre increased ( Figure 6 E). The promoter identified for the att -targeting spacer (pAttGuide) was highly expressed when Xre was not present and increasingly repressed with increasing amounts of Xre induction ( Figure 6 E). As predicted and shown below, this system provides a burst of the atypical guide RNA that is specific to the guaC or yciA att sites with I-F3a elements upon entry into a new host via zygotic induction.
I-F3b elements were also surveyed for inverted repeat motifs to investigate the functional role of the conserved C .Csp 231I-like Xre regulator. Like I-F3a elements, conserved motifs were found in the promoter region of xre that were nearly identical to those used by C. Csp 231I ( Figure 6 B; Figure S4 B; McGeehan et al., 2011 27. McGeehan, J.E. ∙ Streeter, S.D. ∙ Thresh, S.J. ... Structural analysis of a novel class of R-M controller proteins: C.Csp231I from Citrobacter sp. RFL231 J. Mol. Biol. 2011; 409 :177-188 Crossref Scopus (12) PubMed Google Scholar ). Unlike the I-F3a elements, the conserved motif could not be identified upstream of the CRISPR arrays with the I-F3b elements; instead, we found a single copy of this motif upstream of the tniQ-cas8/5,7,6 operon ( Figures 2 A and 6 B). The regulatory regions were confirmed in vitro with two I-F3b elements from A. salmonicida S44 Tn6900 (As) and Vibrio sp. 10N.286.45.B6 (VB6). Binding to the two predicted motifs in the upstream region of Xre could be visualized as two separately migrating species ( Figure 6 D). Mutating the xre -proximal regulatory motif weakened interaction, as demonstrated by the higher concentration of protein required to achieve a full mobility shift ( Figure 6 D). We additionally visualized interaction with the motif upstream of tniQ-cas8/5,7,6 and confirmed the sequence-specific nature of binding by utilizing a mutated motif that weakened interaction. LacZ reporter assays were again used to confirm a functional role in regulation. The Xre regulator was shown to act as a repressor of its own pXre promoter ( Figure 6 F). Interestingly, mutation of the proximal binding site that impaired binding in vitro resulted in the Xre regulator acting as an activator, suggesting that interaction with the distal site activates transcription, whereas interaction with the proximal site represses it ( Figure 6 F). Similar to the result with the I-F3a elements, the Xre regulator was able to repress tniQ-cas8/5,7,6 expression, and this repression was impaired by mutation of the conserved binding motif ( Figure 6 F).
An additional assay was used to confirm zygotic induction following conjugal transfer of regulatory regions with examples from the I-F3a and I-F3b systems. Consistent with the biochemistry and expression control data with the Xre proteins found in Tn7-CRISPR-Cas elements and previously literature on controller proteins, the Xre proteins allow tight repression in an established donor and a strong burst of expression when transmitted into a new recipient ( Figure 7 ). Recipient strains expressing Xre regulators are immunized from this expression burst following conjugation. To signify the Xre-dependent control demonstrated with CRISPR-Cas promoters in Tn7-CRISPR-Cas elements, we propose naming the xre genes rtaC and rtbC (RNA-guided transposon/transposition I-F3a or I-F3b controller).

Section: Discussion

Our findings indicate that the major family of Tn7-CRISPR-Cas systems has evolved a categorization system using conventional and specialized guide RNAs. We find that all transposition can be accounted for by spacers in the element-encoded CRISPR array ( Figure 1 ) and that transposition with members of both major branches of these elements requires guide RNAs for att -targeted transposition ( Figures 3 and 4 ). We also show that the spacers used to target chromosomal sites show certain characteristics; in addition to residing in the last position in the array ( Figure 1 ), they are flanked by highly diverged repeats ( Figure 2 ) and maintain mismatches that show little or no effect on guide RNA-directed transposition ( Figures 3 C and 4 C) but that render them unusable for interreference with a conventional 1-F1 system ( Figure 5 ). The repeat divergence appears to be specifically beneficial for a type I-F3b element from A. salmonicida S44 because these atypical guide RNA complexes are almost completely unusable for I-F1-mediated interference, even when perfectly matched to a target ( Figure 5 ), while allowing a higher level of transposition than what is found with the typical guide RNAs ( Figure 3 ). We show that each of the branches of I-F3 Tn7-CRISPR-Cas systems have separately co-opted Xre family regulators ( Figure S4 ) that allow a burst of expression specifically for guide RNAs directing transposition into chromosomal att sites when they enter a new host ( Figures 6 and 7 ). The transposon-encoded guide RNAs that allow long-term memory to direct transposition into chromosomal sites are therefore privatized to the transposon-adapted I-F3 system using mismatch tolerance, specialized atypical guide RNAs, and selective regulation to guard against toxic self-targeting by canonical CRISPR-Cas defense systems.
A significant consequence of I-F3 Tn7-CRISPR-Cas elements accessing the chromosome using an element-encoded guide RNA is the hazard of canonical I-F1 CRISPR-Cas systems using the self-targeting guide RNA. Self-targeting spacers that are accessed by other canonical CRISPR-Cas systems would be a liability whenever the element entered a host that already had this family of CRISPR-Cas systems. Regarding this point, we find that a I-F1 system can use typical guide RNAs encoded in I-F3 CRISPR arrays in interference ( Figure 5 ). Standard I-F1 systems are found in Vibrionales and Aeromonadales, and with our analysis, we found multiple specific examples where I-F3 Tn7-CRISPR-Cas elements reside in strains that have standard I-F1 systems ( Table S1 ). Self-targeting spacers have been identified in the work of others and have even been used as a tool to help identify anti-CRISPR systems ( Borges et al., 2017 5. Borges, A.L. ∙ Davidson, A.R. ∙ Bondy-Denomy, J. The Discovery, Mechanisms, and Evolutionary Impact of Anti-CRISPRs Annu. Rev. Virol. 2017; 4 :37-59 Crossref Scopus (137) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, established members of anti-CRISPR systems are not widely conserved in elements with Tn7-CRISPR-Cas systems in our analysis ( Wiegand et al., 2020 49. Wiegand, T. ∙ Karambelkar, S. ∙ Bondy-Denomy, J. ... Structures and Strategies of Anti-CRISPR-Mediated Immune Suppression Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2020; 74 :21-37 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Mismatch tolerance likely forms a major mechanism of privatization in I-F3 systems. We suspect that mismatches accumulate in I-F3 guide RNAs that recognize chromosomal positions because of strong negative selection when they are found in a host with a I-F1 system. It is notable that 94% of the diverse I-F3 elements reside in only four different chromosomal att sites, indicating that acquisition of new sites occurs very rarely. This is likely explained by the many factors that would theoretically limit evolution of a new chromosomal att site. For example, initial acquisition of spacers from the chromosome is rare and, to become fixed in the population, likely demands a spacer that recognizes a highly conserved gene at a position near one end of the gene to ensure that the gene itself is not inactivated by transposition. As expected, three of the four major att sites are associated with known essential genes ( guaC , rsmJ , and ffs ), whereas the function of the fourth is unknown ( yciA ). Guide RNAs that target protein-coding genes show a concentration of mismatches at the third positions coincident with the wobble positions ( Figure S5 ). Mismatches are known to be tolerated at the sixths positions in I-F systems, but the tolerance for mismatches at the third positions appears to be a specific adaptation for cascade systems used for transposition ( Figure 5 ). Mismatch tolerance is likely to be an insufficient protection from self-targeting spacers with diverse I-F1 systems because other mechanisms also contribute to this process (see below).
In the case of the I-F3b system from A. salmonicida S44, the atypical repeat appears to be a specific adaptation that allows a higher frequency of guide RNA-targeted transposition ( Figures 3 and 4 ) and privatization from a canonical I-F1 interference system ( Figure 5 ). It is unresolved from our work how atypical guide RNAs in the I-F3b system can be private from the I-F1 system but could result from poor processing by the canonical system. A better understanding of what allows atypical guide RNAs to function differently in the I-F3b element derived from A. salmonicida should offer avenues for optimizing guide RNA-directed transposition in future work by modifying the repeats. Interestingly, the type I-F3a Tn7-CRISPR-Cas system from Tn6677 did not show enhanced transposition with the atypical array found in this system; the frequency of transposition was the same with the typical and the highly diverged atypical repeats ( Figures 4 C and 4D). Mismatch tolerance and the regulator program revealed in our work are likely important protections from self-targeting spacers, given that highly diverged repeats from Tn6677 were readily used by a canonical I-F1 interference system ( Figure 5 ).
We suspect that there are multiple distinct ways in which I-F3 Cas proteins have adapted to recognize specialized atypical repeats based on our bioinformatics. Interestingly, we notice that, in one subbranch within the I-F3b elements, the final spacer is truncated in length by 10–12 bp ( Figure 1 ; Figure S6 ). These smaller spacers produce functional guide RNAs, as predicted by the commensurate natural repositioning of the insertion closer to the protospacer ( Figure S6 ). Previous work in closely related CRISPR-Cas systems suggests that guide RNAs of this length will not be functional for targeting transposition or robust interference ( Klompe et al., 2019 21. Klompe, S.E. ∙ Vo, P.L.H. ∙ Halpin-Healy, T.S. ... Transposon-encoded CRISPR-Cas systems direct RNA-guided DNA integration Nature. 2019; 571 :219-225 Crossref Scopus (369) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kuznedelov et al., 2016 22. Kuznedelov, K. ∙ Mekler, V. ∙ Lemak, S. ... Altered stoichiometry Escherichia coli Cascade complexes with shortened CRISPR RNA spacers are capable of interference and primed adaptation Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44 :10849-10861 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the ability of the I-F3b systems to accommodate shorter guide RNAs could provide another mechanism of privatization from other I-F CRISPR-Cas systems. Intriguingly, naturally occurring minimal type I-F2 CRISPR-Cas systems tested in the laboratory are not functional for interference with similarly truncated guide RNAs but can still form complexes capable of forming R-loops to matching protospacers ( Gleditzsch et al., 2016 15. Gleditzsch, D. ∙ Müller-Esparza, H. ∙ Pausch, P. ... Modulating the Cascade architecture of a minimal Type I-F CRISPR-Cas system Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44 :5872-5882 Crossref Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Both branches of I-F3 elements use Xre (RtaC/RtbC) proteins for “zygotic” induction, where the gene program is reset when they enter a new host that lacks the regulatory protein ( Figures 6 and 7 ). This type of regulatory scheme is important for related controller (C) proteins with some restriction-modification systems to ensure that the new host is methylated before expression of the restriction component ( Rodic et al., 2017 40. Rodic, A. ∙ Blagojevic, B. ∙ Zdobnov, E. ... Understanding key features of bacterial restriction-modification systems through quantitative modeling BMC Syst. Biol. 2017; 11 :377 PubMed Google Scholar ). Using the I-F3a elements tested in our experiments as an example, the att -targeting spacer, guaC or yciA , is tightly repressed in Xre (RtaC)-containing donor cells but derepressed upon entering a new host ( Figures 6 and 7 ). This expression profile would program the Tn7-CRISPR-Cas element to transpose into the neutral chromosomal att sites upon entry into the new host. The strong repression (as demonstrated in donor cells) could then help guard against potential self-targeting with this guide RNA in the presence of endogenous I-F1 systems. Presumably a basal expression level from the primary CRISPR array would allow production of sufficient guide RNA complexes to recognize mobile elements to allow horizontal transfer of I-F3a elements into new hosts.
In the I-F3b elements, the TniQ-Cascade operon itself is subject to Xre (RtbC) regulation. Presumably, this bolus of expression would facilitate transposition into the chromosomal ffs or rsmJ att site. In CRISPR-Cas systems, the total number of effective guide RNA complexes will be a function of the amount of cascade components as related to the number of different spacers and their expression levels ( Martynov et al., 2017 26. Martynov, A. ∙ Severinov, K. ∙ Ispolatov, I. Optimal number of spacers in CRISPR arrays PLoS Comput. Biol. 2017; 13 :e1005891 Crossref Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, the I-F3b systems like the ones found with Tn6900 may draw additional benefit by swamping the cell with effector complexes to overwhelm any I-F1 systems potentially found in a new host. Although I-F3b elements may not generally rely on transcriptional regulation to privatize the self-targeting spacer from any endogenous CRISPR-Cas system, they have nonetheless co-opted a similar regulatory pathway to activate transposition function in a new host.
The outlier element found in Parashewanella curva C51 provides an interesting alternative hybrid two-pathway strategy from the other elements using the I-F3 CRISPR-Cas system ( Figure 1 ). Unlike the other I-F3 family elements indicated in Figure 1 , this element does not have a spacer that could form a guide RNA complex to recognize where it inserted in the chromosome. Interestingly, this element is from a small group of representatives that encode two TniQ proteins. One TniQ is associated with the Cascade operon, and the second is similar to a TniQ protein found in other Tn7-like elements lacking CRISPR-Cas components that reside in an attachment site downstream of the parE gene encoding the essential and conserved topoisomerase IV, subunit B ( Figure S7 ). These elements are predicted to use guide RNA-directed transposition to recognize mobile elements but presumably continue to rely on the mechanism used by prototypic Tn7 and most other Tn7-like elements ( Peters, 2014 34. Peters, J.E. Tn7 Microbiol. Spectr. 2014; 2 :1-20 Google Scholar ); in this case, with the TniQ protein recognizing the parE gene coding region. In two previously identified instances where type I-B CRISPR-Cas systems were captured by other Tn7-like members, the elements have a similar configuration with two tniQ genes and likely function in a similar way to allow a two pathway lifestyle ( Peters et al., 2017 37. Peters, J.E. ∙ Makarova, K.S. ∙ Shmakov, S. ... Recruitment of CRISPR-Cas systems by Tn7-like transposons Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :E7358-E7366 Crossref Scopus (185) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is unclear how Tn7-CRISPR-Cas elements with a type V-K CRISPR-Cas system control the use of two pathways, given that these elements only encode a single tniQ gene ( Faure et al., 2019b 13. Faure, G. ∙ Shmakov, S.A. ∙ Yan, W.X. ... CRISPR-Cas in mobile genetic elements: counter-defence and beyond Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2019; 17 :513-525 Crossref Scopus (184) PubMed Google Scholar ).
It will be interesting to learn how the adaptations found in I-F3 Tn7-CRISPR-Cas systems extend to canonical CRISPR-Cas systems and to other cases where CRISPR-Cas systems have been co-opted for new functions. The examples shown here join numerous others where it is now clear that CRISPR-Cas activity is regulated to offset potential negative effects of these potent systems ( Høyland-Kroghsbo et al., 2017 16. Høyland-Kroghsbo, N.M. ∙ Paczkowski, J. ∙ Mukherjee, S. ... Quorum sensing controls the Pseudomonas aeruginosa CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune system Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :131-135 Crossref Scopus (205) PubMed Google Scholar ; Patterson et al., 2016 32. Patterson, A.G. ∙ Jackson, S.A. ∙ Taylor, C. ... Quorum Sensing Controls Adaptive Immunity through the Regulation of Multiple CRISPR-Cas Systems Mol. Cell. 2016; 64 :1102-1108 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (156) PubMed Google Scholar ; Westra et al., 2010 48. Westra, E.R. ∙ Pul, U. ∙ Heidrich, N. ... H-NS-mediated repression of CRISPR-based immunity in Escherichia coli K12 can be relieved by the transcription activator LeuO Mol. Microbiol. 2010; 77 :1380-1393 Crossref Scopus (204) PubMed Google Scholar ). Transposition levels with the I-F3b system developed in our work are robust, occurring in as much as one third of the cell population, suggesting that it should be a good candidate for future application-based work. The new information with atypical guide RNAs also suggests additional avenues for altering guide RNA activity for practical applications in Tn7-CRISPR-Cas systems or, potentially, CRISPR-Cas systems in general.

The dataset of I-F3 Tn7-CRISPR-Cas elements generated during this study is available as Table S1 . This study did not generate any unique code.
Escherichia coli strains were grown at 30 or 37°C in lysogeny broth (LB) or on LB agar (unless stated otherwise in the Method Details) supplemented with the following concentrations of antibiotics when appropriate: 100 μg/mL carbenicillin, 10 μg/mL gentamicin, 30 μg/mL chloramphenicol, 8 μg/mL tetracycline, 50 μg/mL kanamycin, 100 μg/mL spectinomycin.
Annotated protein fasta files, genomic sequences and feature tables of Gammaproteobacteria were downloaded from National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) FTP site on September 22, 2019. In total, there were 53,079 genomes for analysis.
Profile HMMs associated with TnsA (PF08722,PF08721), TnsB (PF00665), TnsC (PF11426,PF05621), TniQ(PF06527), Cas5f(PF09614), Cas6f(PF09618), Cas7f(PF09615) and Xre family proteins(PF01381), which can be downloaded from The European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) Pfam database, were used for detecting homologs with hmmsearch (HMMER3).
Candidate proteins were grouped into tnsABC operons and tniQ-cas operon based on their orientation and proximity. Then each tnsABC operon was grouped with its downstream tniQ-cas operon into one transposon functional unit. The Xre/HTH (helix turn helix) proteins situated between the two operons and are homologous to restriction controller proteins (blastp, identity > 40%) were defined as candidate regulators.
Manually curated CRISPR repeats of Tn7-CRISPR-Cas elements were used to create a DNA sequence profile, which was used as a query for nhmmscan searches (HMMER3) to find CRISPR repeats in the downstream 20-kb region of cas6 . Putative repeats were grouped into arrays by their distances to each other. The distance between repeats was required to be > 55 bp and < 65 bp, the bit-score threshold is −1. The distance between last repeat and previous repeat was allowed to be between 43 bp and 55 bp, but in such cases its bit-score had to be > = 0.3. The sum of bit-scores of repeats in an array cannot be lower than 6.0. The longest non-overlapping arrays are collected as putative CRISPR arrays. All repeats besides the final repeat from the first array downstream of cas6 were used to create an updated repeat profile, and the CRISPR detection procedure was repeated with the new profile twice.
To detect protospacers that match the transposon-associated CRISPR spacers, each spacer was converted into position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) and used to search upstream 1-kb DNA of tnsA for matches with Biopython (threshold = 11.0). Because every 6th base of spacers is flipped out in type I CRISPR Cascade complex, all 6th positions of the matrix are set to have equal weight on all four bases.
Except for ffs (SRP-RNA), the major attachment site genes that containing the candidate protospacers are classified with the annotations provided in NCBI. The attachment site SRP-RNA gene ( ffs ) is often poorly annotated, so it was reannotated using cmsearch (Infernal) and SRP-RNA profile (RF00169) available on RFAM ( https://rfam.xfam.org/ ).
The TnsA, TniQ and Xre proteins were clustered using Cd-hit with identity threshold set to 90%. Multiple alignments of the representatives were done with MUSCLE. Similarity trees were made with FastTree using WAG evolutionary model and the discrete gamma model with 20 rate categories as previously described ( Peters et al., 2017 37. Peters, J.E. ∙ Makarova, K.S. ∙ Shmakov, S. ... Recruitment of CRISPR-Cas systems by Tn7-like transposons Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :E7358-E7366 Crossref Scopus (185) PubMed Google Scholar ). The visualization of the trees, major attachment sites, CRISPR arrays and matched spacers was done with ETEToolkit.
The transposons were classified into two groups based on associated xre lengths (68 aa for I-F3a or ∼100 aa for I-F3b) and similarities to C. Ahd I and C. Csp 231I. For each group, the 100bp upstream of xre, second CRISPR array, and tniQ-cas operon were collected and deduplicated with dedupe.sh (BBTools) with threshold of 70% identity or 30 edit distance. The sequences were then sent to MEME for motif detection and comparison.
To make consensus sequences of CRISPR repeats, the transposon representatives with non-redundant TniQ were selected with Cd-hit and separated into two groups based on their attachment sites being ffs / rsmJ or guaC / yciA . The upstream and downstream CRISPR repeats of the chromosome targeting spacers, and repeats not flanking chromosome targeting spacers were collected and sequence logos created using WebLogo 3.
All transposition assays were performed in MTP1191, or one of MTP997 or MTP1196 with an F plasmid derivative as indicated in Table S2 .
For Tn6900 transposition, strains used to monitor transposition were made competent by growing cells in LB media to mid-log, washed, and resuspended in ice cold a 0.1M CaCl 2 solution ( Peters, 2007 33. Peters, J.E. Gene transfer - Gram-negative bacteria, Chapter 31 Methods for General and Molecular Microbiology. ASM Press, 2007 735-755 Google Scholar ) and transformed with pMTP130, pMTP140, and a derivative of pMTP150, pMTP160, pMTP170, or pMTP190 as indicated in Table S2 onto LB agar supplemented with 100 μg/mL carbenicillin, 10 μg/mL gentamicin, 30 μg/mL chloramphenicol, and 0.2% w/v glucose. After 16 hours incubation at 37°C, several hundred transformants were washed up in M9 minimal media (Peters, 2007) supplemented with 0.2% w/v maltose and diluted to a calculated OD = 0.2 in M9 supplemented with 100 μg/mL carbenicillin, 10 μg/mL gentamicin, 30 μg/mL chloramphenicol, 0.2% w/v arabinose, and 100 μM IPTG to induce transposition.
For experiments monitoring transposition frequency through loss of sugar metabolism on MacConkey’s media, induction pools were incubated for 24 hours with shaking at 30°C before being serially diluted in LB and plated on MacConkeys 1% w/v lactose, sorbitol, or galactose. Plates were incubated at 37°C for 16 hours before colonies were counted.
For experiments monitoring transposition frequency by the mate out assay (Figure S2a), after 24 hours incubation with shaking at 30°C, a portion of induced cultures were washed once and resuspended in LB supplemented with 0.2% w/v glucose.
