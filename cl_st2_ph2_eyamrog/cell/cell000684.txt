Title: Quorum-sensing- and type VI secretion-mediated spatiotemporal cell death drives genetic diversity in Vibrio cholerae


Abstract: Summary

Bacterial colonies composed of genetically identical individuals can diversify to yield variant cells with distinct genotypes. Variant outgrowth manifests as sectors. Here, we show that Type VI secretion system (T6SS)-driven cell death in Vibrio cholerae colonies imposes a selective pressure for the emergence of variant strains that can evade T6SS-mediated killing. T6SS-mediated cell death occurs in two distinct spatiotemporal phases, and each phase is driven by a particular T6SS toxin. The first phase is regulated by quorum sensing and drives sectoring. The second phase does not require the T6SS-injection machinery. Variant V. cholerae strains isolated from colony sectors encode mutated quorum-sensing components that confer growth advantages by suppressing T6SS-killing activity while simultaneously boosting T6SS-killing defenses. Our findings show that the T6SS can eliminate sibling cells, suggesting a role in intra-specific antagonism. We propose that quorum-sensing-controlled T6SS-driven killing promotes V. cholerae genetic diversity, including in natural habitats and during disease.

Section: Introduction

Bacteria track cell population density using a process called quorum sensing (QS). QS relies on the production, release, accumulation, and detection of extracellular signal molecules called autoinducers (AIs). QS enables groups of bacteria to synchronize gene expression and collectively enact processes that demand many cells working together to make the task successful ( Papenfort and Bassler, 2016 44. Papenfort, K. ∙ Bassler, B.L. Quorum sensing signal-response systems in Gram-negative bacteria Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2016; 14 :576-588 Crossref Scopus (1416) PubMed Google Scholar ; Waters and Bassler, 2005 55. Waters, C.M. ∙ Bassler, B.L. Quorum sensing: cell-to-cell communication in bacteria Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21 :319-346 Crossref Scopus (3012) PubMed Google Scholar ). In Vibrio cholerae , the causative agent of the cholera disease and the model bacterium used for the present work, two parallel QS pathways funnel information contained in AIs to a shared transcription factor called LuxO ( Figure 1 ) ( Miller et al., 2002 40. Miller, M.B. ∙ Skorupski, K. ∙ Lenz, D.H. ... Parallel quorum sensing systems converge to regulate virulence in Vibrio cholerae Cell. 2002; 110 :303-314 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). At low cell density (LCD), in the absence of AIs, the AI receptors act as kinases ferrying phosphate to LuxO ( Wei et al., 2012 57. Wei, Y. ∙ Ng, W. ∙ Cong, J. ... Ligand and antagonist driven regulation of the Vibrio cholerae quorum-sensing receptor CqsS Mol. Microbiol. 2012; 83 :1095-1108 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ). LuxO∼P activates transcription of genes encoding four small RNAs (sRNA) called Qrr1-4. Qrr1-4 repress translation of HapR, encoding the master high cell density (HCD) QS regulator ( Lenz et al., 2004 33. Lenz, D.H. ∙ Mok, K.C. ∙ Lilley, B.N. ...

At HCD, when AIs have accumulated, the receptors act as phosphatases ( Neiditch et al., 2005 41. Neiditch, M.B. ∙ Federle, M.J. ∙ Miller, S.T. ... Regulation of LuxPQ Receptor Activity by the Quorum-Sensing Signal Autoinducer-2 Mol. Cell. 2005; 18 :507-518 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (170) PubMed Google Scholar ). LuxO is dephosphorylated and inactive. Production of the Qrr sRNAs is halted, HapR is translated, and it promotes expression of QS-controlled genes specifying collective behaviors ( Lenz et al., 2004 33. Lenz, D.H. ∙ Mok, K.C. ∙ Lilley, B.N. ...

The V. cholerae type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a QS-regulated, contact-dependent protein delivery system that enables attack and elimination of competitor cells ( MacIntyre et al., 2010 34. MacIntyre, D.L. ∙ Miyata, S.T. ∙ Kitaoka, M. ... The Vibrio cholerae type VI secretion system displays antimicrobial properties Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Quorum regulatory small RNAs repress type VI secretion in Vibrio cholerae Mol. Microbiol. 2014; 92 :921-930 Crossref Scopus (71) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, T6SS structural components are assembled into a membrane-spanning spear-like device loaded with toxic effector proteins ( Ho et al., 2014 20. Ho, B. ∙ Dong, T. ∙ Mekalanos, J.

Assembly and Subcellular Localization of Bacterial Type VI Secretion Systems Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2019; 73 :621-638 Crossref Scopus (76) PubMed Google Scholar ). The apparatus shoots the effectors into competitor cells by puncturing their cell walls. To prevent self-killing, T6SS-active bacteria produce immunity proteins that inactivate the toxic effector proteins ( Ho et al., 2014 20. Ho, B. ∙ Dong, T. ∙ Mekalanos, J.

Other defenses, such as production of exopolysaccharide or capsular polysaccharide also protect against incoming T6SS attacks ( Flaugnatti et al., 2021 16.

USA. 2018; 115 :7997-8002 Crossref Scopus (69) PubMed Google Scholar ). In V. cholerae , t6ss genes are located in one large and three auxiliary clusters ( Figure S1 ) ( Metzger et al., 2016 39. Metzger, L.C. ∙ Stutzmann, S. ∙ Scrignari, T. ... Independent Regulation of Type VI secretion in Vibrio cholerae by TfoX and TfoY Cell Rep. 2016; 15 :951-958 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ). The T6SS machinery is largely conserved among V. cholerae strains, however, its expression and regulation are strain specific. Important for this work is that a cis -acting single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) causes the El Tor environmental isolate 2740-80 to express its t6ss genes ( Dörr et al., 2022 11. Dörr, N.C.D. ∙ Proutière, A. ∙ Jaskólska, M. ...

Ng, S.L. ∙ Kammann, S. ∙ Steinbach, G. ... Evolution of a Cis-Acting SNP that Controls Type VI Secretion in Vibrio cholerae bioRxiv. 2022; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). By contrast, the closely related pandemic isolate C6706 that lacks the cis -acting SNP does not express t6ss genes under laboratory conditions. In V. cholerae strains that do express t6ss genes, at LCD, the Qrr sRNAs repress t6ss expression by two mechanisms: they directly repress the large t6ss cluster and they function indirectly by repressing hapR , an HCD activator of the auxiliary t6ss gene clusters ( Shao and Bassler, 2014 50. Shao, Y. ∙ Bassler, B.L. Quorum regulatory small RNAs repress type VI secretion in Vibrio cholerae Mol. Microbiol. 2014; 92 :921-930 Crossref Scopus (71) PubMed Google Scholar ). Direct cell-to-cell contact is required for T6SS toxin deployment ( MacIntyre et al., 2010 34. MacIntyre, D.L. ∙ Miyata, S.T. ∙ Kitaoka, M. ... The Vibrio cholerae type VI secretion system displays antimicrobial properties Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107 :19520-19524 Crossref Scopus (327) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, restricting maximal production of the T6SS machinery to HCD could boost killing efficiency and be bioenergetically favorable.
Bacterial colonies are structured communities in which cells occupy micro-habitats with varying physical and chemical compositions ( Bjedov et al., 2003 5. Bjedov, I. ∙ Tenaillon, O. ∙ Gérard, B. ...

These heterogeneous environments impose distinct selective pressures for advantageous variant genotypes to arise. Often, the appearance of variants manifests as colony sectors. In Staphylococcus aureus and V. cholerae , such variants display increased virulence in animal models and/or resistance to antibiotics ( Finkelstein et al., 1992 15. Finkelstein, R.A. ∙ Boesman-Finkelstein, M. ∙ Chang, Y. ... Vibrio cholerae hemagglutinin/protease, colonial variation, virulence, and detachment Infect.

Servin-Massieu, M. Spontaneous appearance of sectored colonies in Staphylococcus aureus cultures J. Bacteriol. 1961; 82 :316-317 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Understanding the mechanisms driving colony variation could provide insight into the general emergence of new genotypes and their corresponding traits.
Here, we investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying colony sectoring in V. cholerae . We find that sectoring in colonies initially composed of genetically identical cells is preceded by T6SS-mediated cell death that occurs in two different spatiotemporal phases, each driven by distinct T6SS effectors. Tracking cell death using fluorescence microscopy shows the first phase occurs along the colony rim. During this cell death phase, QS, t6ss , and vps genes exhibit regional differences in expression, which sets the cell death spatial pattern. T6SS-driven killing imposes a selective pressure for variant strains containing QS-inactivating mutations to arise. Loss of QS activity confers protection from T6SS-killing by two mechanisms. First, production of vibrio polysaccharide (Vps), normally a QS-repressed trait, increases and Vps acts to shield cells from incoming T6SS attacks. Second, elimination of QS-dependent activation of t6ss gene expression reduces overall T6SS-killing events. These changes confer regional growth advantages to the QS loss-of-function mutants that manifest as outgrowth into colony sectors. While requiring a T6SS toxin, the second cell death phase—which occurs in the colony interior—does not affect sectoring, and, intriguingly, does not rely on the T6SS-injection apparatus. We propose that T6SS-driven intra-specific antagonism promotes V. cholerae genetic diversity, including in natural habitats and during disease, both of which are well known to select for V. cholerae variants that display reduced QS activity.

Section: Results

Certain Vibrionaceae bacteria, including strains of Vibrio vulnificus , Vibrio parahaemolyticus , Vibrio harveyi , and V. cholerae , form colonies that, over time, develop sectors that differ in opacity compared to the original colony ( Chatzidaki-Livanis et al., 2006 7.

Simon, M. ∙ Silverman, M. Recombinational Regulation of Gene Expression in Bacteria 1983 Crossref Google Scholar ). Presumably, other characteristics not visible to the eye are also regionally altered in the sectors and/or elsewhere in such colonies. The mechanism driving particular vibrios to form heterogeneous communities is not known. Here, we investigate the molecular underpinnings of colony sectoring using V. cholerae as our model system.
Following ∼2 days of incubation on solid Luria-Bertani (LB) medium, colonies of the O37 serogroup strain V52 and V. cholerae El Tor biotype strain C6706 did not sector and their morphologies remained uniformly translucent ( Figure 2 A). By contrast, the closely related V. cholerae El Tor biotype strain 2740-80 formed opaque sectors that were distinct from the translucent morphology of the initially growing colony ( Figure 2 A). We purified isolates from ten individual V. cholerae 2740-80 sectors. Each isolate formed a homogeneous opaque colony that did not sector, suggesting that these variants have acquired mutations that lock them into the phenotype of the sector. The levels of opacity differed between isolates, with the most extreme variant colonies displaying wrinkled morphologies ( Figure 2 A shows seven of these isolates). In V. cholerae , over-production of Vps confers an opaque and wrinkled colony appearance, indicating that the variants from the sectors may have acquired mutations that drive increased Vps production. To investigate this possibility, we used whole genome and Sanger sequencing to pinpoint the mutations that had occurred in nine of the isolated V. cholerae 2740-80 variants. Seven variants possessed a single nucleotide change, a deletion, an insertion, or an insertion-element aided interruption in genes encoding the V. cholerae master QS regulators LuxO (3 variants) and HapR (4 variants) ( Table S1 and designated in Figure 2 A). One variant acquired a mutation in the 3′ UTR of the gene encoding the cold shock protein CspA, and the final variant had a mutation in pyrG encoding CTP synthase ( Table S1 ). Here, we focus on how alterations in QS drive changes in V. cholerae colony morphology and sectoring capability. We remark on the cspA and pyrG mutants in the Discussion .
To explore the connection between QS, sectoring, and colony morphology, we assessed whether the mutations in luxO and hapR that arose in the sectors specified gain- or loss-of-function alleles. Both LuxO and HapR are transcription factors. To measure their activities, we engineered luciferase ( lux ) transcriptional reporter fusions to well-characterized LuxO-controlled ( qrr 4) and HapR-controlled ( luxC ) promoters (designated qrr 4- lux and luxC-lux , respectively). First, regarding LuxO: LuxO is phosphorylated and activates qrr 4 transcription at LCD ( Figure 1 ). The V. cholerae 2740-80 variants harboring mutations in luxO expressed ∼100-fold more qrr 4 -lux than did V. cholerae 2740-80 at HCD. This result shows that the luxO variants are gain-of-function alleles ( Figure 2 B). Regarding HapR: HapR is produced and functions at HCD, when it activates transcription of genes ( Figure 1 ). All of the hapR variants except one expressed ∼100–1,000-fold less luxC-lux than did V. cholerae 2740-80 at HCD, showing that the HapR variants are either attenuated- or loss-of-function alleles ( Figure 2 C). Indeed, the colony morphologies of the loss-of-function hapR variants mimicked that of a Δ hapR strain (see Figure S2 A for examples). Only the HapR A52T variant did not display an altered luxC-lux level ( Figure 2 C). HapR A52T has been studied previously. The A52T alteration affects HapR binding to DNA to different extents at different target promoters, but it does not affect binding to the luxC promoter ( van Kessel et al., 2013 31. van Kessel, J.C. ∙ Ulrich, L.E. ∙ Zhulin, I.B. ... Analysis of Activator and Repressor Functions Reveals the Requirements for Transcriptional Control by LuxR, the Master Regulator of Quorum Sensing in Vibrio harveyi Vibrio harveyi MBio. 2013; 4 :e00378-13 Crossref Scopus (69) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, all but one of the QS mutants identified from the colony sectors “lock” the cells into the LCD QS mode.
QS promotes Vps production at LCD in V. cholerae ( Hammer and Bassler, 2003 17. Hammer, B.K. ∙ Bassler, B.L. Quorum sensing controls biofilm formation in Vibrio cholerae Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50 :101-104 Crossref Scopus (694) PubMed Google Scholar ). To connect the QS locked-LCD variant phenotypes to their opaque/wrinkled morphologies, we introduced a vpsL-lux transcriptional fusion into the strains and measured the output. vpsL encodes a biosynthetic protein required for Vps production. All of the LCD-locked QS variants displayed increased vpsL-lux expression compared with V. cholerae 2740-80 ( Figure 2 D). Thus, the LCD-locked QS states of the variants increases Vps production, and excess Vps converts the colonies from translucent to opaque/wrinkled. Importantly, although the colony wrinkling morphologies of the LCD-locked QS variants differed one from the other, none of the variant colonies sectored ( Figure 2 A).
Collectively, the above results suggest that the HCD QS mode drives colony sectoring. Moreover, the sectors contain cells with genotypes that differ from that of the parent strain and the different mutations in the cells in the sectors underlie their distinct morphologies. Because the QS receptors funnel all sensory information to LuxO, and LuxO functions upstream of HapR in the cascade ( Figure 1 ), in the remainder of this work, we focus on the luxO variant strains to understand how the LCD-locked state influences colony sectoring.
V. cholerae 2740-80, which sectors, highly expresses the genes encoding its T6SS, whereas V. cholerae C6706, which is also an El Tor biotype strain but does not sector, does not express t6ss genes under laboratory conditions. V. cholerae uses Vps as a physical barrier to block T6SS attacks ( Toska et al., 2018 52. Toska, J. ∙ Ho, B.T. ∙ Mekalanos, J.J. Exopolysaccharide protects Vibrio cholerae from exogenous attacks by the type 6 secretion system Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115 :7997-8002 Crossref Scopus (69) PubMed Google Scholar ). In V. cholerae 2740-80, at LCD, LuxO∼P activates vps gene expression and represses t6ss gene expression ( Figure 1 ) ( Hammer and Bassler, 2003 17. Hammer, B.K. ∙ Bassler, B.L. Quorum sensing controls biofilm formation in Vibrio cholerae Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50 :101-104 Crossref Scopus (694) PubMed Google Scholar ; Shao and Bassler, 2014 50. Shao, Y. ∙ Bassler, B.L. Quorum regulatory small RNAs repress type VI secretion in Vibrio cholerae Mol. Microbiol. 2014; 92 :921-930 Crossref Scopus (71) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, in our V. cholerae 2740-80 LCD-locked LuxO QS variants, vps expression is higher ( Figure 2 D). Similarly, at HCD, HapR represses vps expression; so in our hapR loss-of-function mutants, vp s expression increases ( Figure 2 D). Based on these patterns, we wondered whether cells in colonies of V. cholerae 2740-80 undergo T6SS-dependent killing. If so, individual cells that acquire mutations, such as in QS components that confer an increased ability to produce Vps, would reap growth advantages because they could use Vps to evade T6SS killing. This growth advantage could manifest in outgrowth as a sector. We designed experiments to test these ideas.
First, we assessed whether colonies of V. cholerae 2740-80 undergo T6SS-dependent killing and, if so, whether this affects colony sectoring. To do this, we quantified cell death in colonies of V. cholerae 2740-80 and in an isogenic strain lacking all four pairs of T6SS effector-immunity proteins (hereafter: Δ8 strain). We used time-lapse fluorescence microscopy to track live and dead cells and colony sectoring. For this analysis, all cells constitutively produced the mKO fluorescent protein (Red) to enable imaging of live cells and we used the fluorescent dye SytoX (Cyan) to mark dead cells. To enable visualization and fluorescence quantitation across the colonies, including in regions with sectors, we collapsed the time series data into single images by generating projections across time. Representative time series images are displayed in Figure 3 A, while Figures 3 B and 3C show the time projections. To quantify spatiotemporal cell death in non-sectored regions, we reduced the time-lapse data into space-time kymographs ( Figure 4 ). In both the time-projections and the kymographs, data were mapped using colors as quantitative readouts for intensities. There are many features in the images that differ between the strains under study. We focus on only four of those features here: region-dependent cell death, time-dependent cell death, T6SS-mediated cell death, and sectoring.
We first discuss the results from V. cholerae 2740-80. The colonies displayed two phases of cell death, which we call “Phase 1” and “Phase 2”, visible in the time projections and kymographs as regions exhibiting increased SytoX-dependent fluorescence relative to mKO fluorescence. Cell death during Phase 1 occurred between ∼8 and 40 h and was concentrated predominantly along the periphery of the colony (first four rows in Figure 3 A, top row Figure 3 B, and Figures 4 A–4C; indicated with the white arrows and the designation P1; Figures S3 A–S3E and Video S1 ). At ∼44 h, Phase 2 of cell death initiated in the colony interior as a ring and propagated in both the inward and outward directions in an apparent wave-like manner (first three and fifth rows in Figure 3 A, top row Figure 3 C, and Figures 4 A, 4B, and 4D; indicated with the white arrows and the designation P2; Figures S3 A–S3E, and Video S1 ). Importantly, ratio-metric kymograph and time-projection analyses of the dead and live cell distributions in the colony (SytoX/mKO) confirmed that the cell death patterns in the different regions and at the different times are not due to differences in cell numbers but, rather, are a consequence of alterations in the ratios of live and dead cells ( Figure 3 A bottom two rows and Figures 3 B, 3C, 4 C, and 4D). The ratio-metric data show that 10-fold more cell death occurs in Phase 1 than in Phase 2, hence, logarithmic ratios of the intensities are provided in Figure 4 D to highlight Phase 2 cell death. In all remaining ratio kymographs, we present the log-transformed data. The companion linear ratio data are provided in the Supplemental information .

Time-lapse image series for growth of V. cholerae 2740-80 constitutively producing mKO which marks live cells (left). Dead cells are marked with SytoX stain (middle). Intensity ratios (right) were obtained as in Figure 3. Intensities are color-mapped and the scale bars on the left of each panel represent color:intensity. Acquisition times are displayed on the bottom right of each panel.
Phase 1 cell death largely preceded the formation of sectors, which began along the colony rim ( Figure 3 A, denoted by yellow arrows). The finding that sector initiation sites co-localize with regions of high Phase 1 cell death is notable given that variants could have emerged anywhere in the colony, as has been observed previously, for example, in Bacillus subtilis ( Hashuel and Ben-Yehuda, 2019 18. Hashuel, R. ∙ Ben-Yehuda, S. Aging of a Bacterial Colony Enforces the Evolvement of Nondifferentiating Mutants MBio. 2019; Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ). Rather, in V. cholerae 2740-80, sectors arise exclusively in regions of high Phase 1 cell death. Furthermore, cells in the sectors were largely living compared to cells in neighboring non-sectored, parental regions of the colony that were undergoing high cell death ( Figure 3 A and Video S1 ). This result suggests that the mutations in the arising variant strains suppress the cell death mechanism.
Cell death dynamics were strikingly altered in the T6SS inactive Δ8 strain. Compared to V. cholerae 2740-80, Phase 1 cell death along the colony rim was ∼2- to 10-fold lower in the Δ8 strain and Phase 2 cell death in the colony interior did not occur ( Figures 3 B, 3C, and 4 E–4H). Despite displaying decreased cell death, the Δ8 strain developed sectors ( Figure 3 C). We conclude that the T6SS is involved in driving both phases of cell death in V. cholerae colonies. Because sectoring was not abolished in the Δ8 strain, mechanism(s) in addition to T6SS can drive sectoring.
We wondered which of the four T6SS effector-immunity (hereafter E-I) protein pairs causes cell death in V. cholerae 2740-80. To identify the pair, we engineered strains lacking one (Δ2), two (Δ4), or each combination of three (Δ6) E-I protein pairs. We monitored cell death in the four Δ2 strains, two Δ4 strains, and four Δ6 strains using time-lapse microscopy, as in Figures 3 and 4 . Data for select strains are displayed in Figure 5 . Data for the full set, i.e., for each Δ2, Δ4, and Δ6 strain, are displayed in Figure S4 (linear ratio kymographs), Figure S5 (logarithmic ratio kymographs), and Figure S6 (time series projections).
Each Δ2 strain, lacking one E-I protein pair, displayed Phase 1 cell death along the colony rim that was indistinguishable from that of V. cholerae 2740-80 ( Figures S4 A–S4F, S5 A–S5F, and S6 A). Data from the strain lacking the TseL-TsiV1 pair is provided as the representative of the Δ2 strains in Figure 5 C and should be compared to the data in Figures 5 A and 5B for V. cholerae 2740-80 and the Δ8 strain, respectively. The Δ4 strain lacking both the VgrG3-TsiV3 and the VasX-TsiV2 protein pairs, by contrast, showed the reduced Phase 1 cell death phenotype of the Δ8 strain ( Figures 5 B, 5D, S4 B, S4G, S5 B, and S5G, and S6 A). Because the Δ2 strains did not display defects in Phase 1 cell death, while the Δ4 strain was impaired for killing, we conclude that the VgrG3 and VasX effector proteins make redundant contributions to Phase 1 cell death. Confirming this assertion, among the Δ6 strains, only two strains, harboring either VgG3-TsiV3 or VasX-TsiV2 as the sole E-I protein pair, displayed Phase 1 cell death patterns like V. cholerae 2740-80 ( Figures 5 A, 5E–5G, S4 A, S4H–S4K, S5 A, S5H–S5K, and S6 A). Consistent with the idea that the remaining two E-I protein pairs, TseL-TsiV1 and TseH-TsiH, are dispensable for driving Phase 1 cell death, the Δ4 strain lacking both of these protein pairs acted like V. cholerae 2740-80 with respect to Phase 1 cell death ( Figures 5 A, 5H, S4 A, S4L, S5 A, S5L, and S6 A). Thus, either the VgG3 or the VasX effector can mediate Phase 1 cell death.
Regarding Phase 2 cell death, which occurs in the colony interior, among the Δ2 strains, cell death was abolished only in the strain lacking TseL-TsiV1, a phenotype mimicking the Δ8 strain (compare data in Figure 5 C in the colony interior to that in 5A and 5B and see Figures S4 A–S4F, S5 A–S5F, and S6 B). Further confirming the role of the TseL-TsiV1 protein pair in Phase 2 cell death, only one Δ6 strain, possessing TseL-TsiV1 as the sole E-I protein pair, showed a Phase 2 cell death pattern akin to that of V. cholerae 2740-80 ( Figure 5 A and 5E–5G; S4 A, S4H–S4K, S5 A, S5H–S5K, and S6 B). Thus, the TseL effector protein is required to drive Phase 2 cell death.
T6SS-dependent killing relies on an injection machine to deliver toxic effector proteins into prey cells. To examine whether the T6SS-dependent killing that takes place in the V. cholerae 2740-80 colonies requires the T6SS-injection apparatus, we deleted vasK , encoding an essential structural component of the injection machine from V. cholerae 2740-80 and from the Δ8 strain. Phase 1 killing along the colony rim was diminished in both the Δ vasK and the Δ8 strains, and combining the Δ vasK and Δ8 mutations (hereafter the Δ9 strain) reinforced the other’s effects, nearly eliminating Phase 1 cell death ( Figures 5 A, 5B 5I, 5J, S7 A–S7D, and S7H). Thus, possession of a functional T6SS-injection machinery contributes strongly to Phase 1 cell death. We offer possibilities that could account for the synergistic effects of the combined Δ vasK and Δ8 mutations in the Discussion .
With respect to Phase 2 cell death in the colony interior, the Δ vasK strain displayed no defect while Phase 2 cell death did not occur in the Δ8 and Δ9 strains ( Figures 5 A, 5B, 5I, 5J, and S7 I). Because Phase 2 cell death is driven by the TseL effector protein ( Figures 5 C, 5G and 5H), we conclude that TseL can cause cell death independent of the T6SS-injection apparatus. This experiment does not allow us to distinguish between whether TseL is translocated to target cells via an alternate mechanism or whether TseL-producing cells experience auto-poisoning.
To probe whether T6SS activity influences sectoring, we quantified the sectoring phenotypes in the strains under study. V. cholerae 2740-80, strains lacking individual or combinations of E-I protein pairs, the Δ8 strain, and the Δ vasK strain all made sectors ( Figures S6 B and S7 I). By contrast, the Δ9 strain consistently formed fewer and/or smaller sectors ( Figure S7 I). Using machine-learning-driven image segmentation, we measured the area occupied by sectors in the Δ9 strain and its progenitors. Sectors in the Δ vasK and Δ8 mutants occupied ∼2.5-fold more area than did sectors in V. cholerae 2740-80 ( Figure 5 K). Sectors in the Δ9 mutant occupied ∼2-fold less area than sectors in V. cholerae 2740-80 and ∼5-fold less area than in the Δ vasK and Δ8 strains ( Figure 5 K). We conclude that T6SS-killing activity drives colony sectoring. In the Discussion , we present possible explanations for the unexpected finding that the Δ vasK and Δ8 mutations each drive increases in sector area occupancy although, when combined, they reduce the colony area occupied by sectors.
The above results suggest that T6SS plays a key role in causing cell death and colony sectoring. As mentioned, excess Vps can defend against T6SS killing. We know that QS controls both t6ss and vps expression in V. cholerae . This understanding enables us to put forward and test the idea that the QS LCD-locked variants we isolated exhibit both reduced T6SS activity and high Vps production. Together, these altered traits suppress T6SS-dependent killing in the colony, which decreases overall cell death, the consequence of which is prevention of sectoring.
To assess whether the LCD QS state alters V. cholerae 2740-80 T6SS activity, we measured the capacity of the luxO variants we isolated to kill Escherichia coli in an inter-bacterial T6SS-dependent killing assay. As prey, we used an E. coli strain that constitutively produces lux , and thus, light output tracks with live prey cells. When the luxO variants were used as predators, there was a 10- to 100-fold decrease in prey killing relative to when V. cholerae 2740-80 was predator ( Figure 6 A). No killing occurred when the Δ vasK strain was the predator, confirming that killing requires T6SS activity ( Figure 6 A). To verify that the decreases in killing ability of the luxO variants were a consequence of decreased expression of t6ss genes, in one representative luxO variant ( luxO A97E ) , we quantified transcript levels for the genes specifying each E-I protein pair and select genes encoding T6SS structural components. Figure 6 B shows the results. Compared to V. cholerae 2740-80, the luxO A97E variant exhibited 2- to 4-fold decreased expression of every tested t6ss gene. Thus, LuxO-driven LCD behavior suppresses T6SS-killing activity in V. cholerae 2740-80.
We examined whether increased Vps production boosts the defense capacity of the V. cholerae 2740-80 LCD-locked QS variants against incoming T6SS attacks. We already know that all the V. cholerae 2740-80 LCD-locked QS variants exhibit increased expression of vps ( Figure 2 D), so we again used the luxO A97E allele as our representative for this analysis. To do the experiment, we introduced the luxO A97E and Δ vpsL mutations, both alone and in combination, into the Δ9 strain. This strategy allowed us to avoid possible complications from secondary mutations that might be present in the original luxO A97E variant strain. Moreover, because each strain in this set lacks all T6SS-immunity proteins, they are susceptible to T6SS-dependent killing following challenge with V. cholerae 2740-80. Lastly, all prey strains were also engineered to carry a constitutive lux reporter enabling tracking of survival. Relative to the Δ9 strain, the Δ9 luxO A97E strain displayed ∼100-fold increased survival against the V. cholerae 2740-80 predator while the Δ9 Δ vpsL and Δ9 Δ vpsL luxO A97E strains showed no survival enhancement ( Figure 6 C). No killing occurred when the Δ9 or Δ9 Δ vpsL strains were challenged with the Δ9 strain as predator, again confirming that T6SS activity drives killing in our assay ( Figure 6 C). Thus, in the luxO A97E LCD-locked variant, and presumably the other variants we isolated, increased Vps production driven by QS functioning in the LCD-mode promotes enhanced defense against incoming T6SS attacks. Moreover, the results show that the protective effect of high level Vps production can overcome the sensitivity to killing caused by complete lack of immunity factors.
Beyond effects on T6SS-killing and T6SS-defense, we examined whether the LCD-locked QS mode promotes an altered cell death pattern. Here, we again used the luxO A97E allele as the representative, and as above to avoid complications from possible secondary mutations in the original variant, we reconstructed all needed mutations in V. cholerae 2740-80 and in the Δ8 strain. Phase 1 cell death along the colony rim was abolished in the luxO A97E and Δ8 luxO A97E strains ( Figures 6 D–6H, S3 F–S3J, S7 A, S7B, S7E, and S7F). Indeed, the luxO A97E mutation eliminated the residual Phase 1 cell death that occurs in the Δ8 strain ( Figures 6 E–6G). Thus, QS fully controls Phase 1 cell death. Given that elimination of T6SS does not abolish all Phase 1 cell death in the Δ8 strain ( Figure 6 E), another QS-controlled process must be involved in Phase 1 cell death. By contrast, the luxO A97E strain displayed Phase 2 cell death in the colony interior like V. cholerae 2740-80 ( Figures 6 D, 6F, and 6I). The Δ8 luxO A97E strain mimicked the Δ8 strain and displayed no Phase 2 killing ( Figures 6 E–6G and 6I). Thus, Phase 2 cell death, which is TseL-dependent ( Figures 5 C, 5G, and 5H), is not subject to QS regulation. Finally, none of the strains carrying luxO A97E sectored, including in the Δ8 background ( Figure 6 I; see bottom two rows). Thus, the LCD QS state is epistatic to T6SS with respect to sectoring. Because the LCD-locked variants do not sector and have no Phase 1 cell death, but undergo Phase 2 cell death, we infer that Phase 1 cell death is key to the sectoring phenotype whereas Phase 2 cell death may be dispensable for sectoring.
To pinpoint the mechanism that connects QS to T6SS-driven cell death, Vps, and sectoring phenotypes, we focused on the Qrr sRNAs that repress translation of the large t6ss gene cluster, and indirectly activate vps gene expression ( Figure 1 ) ( Shao and Bassler, 2014 50. Shao, Y. ∙ Bassler, B.L. Quorum regulatory small RNAs repress type VI secretion in Vibrio cholerae Mol. Microbiol. 2014; 92 :921-930 Crossref Scopus (71) PubMed Google Scholar ). To test if the QS phenotypes hinge on Qrr activity, we constitutively expressed one of them, qrr 4 (Ptac- qrr 4), in V. cholerae 2740-80 and examined the phenotypic consequences. Introduction of Ptac- qrr 4 abolished Phase 1 cell death and sectoring in V. cholerae 2740-80, including the low-level cell death that occurs in the Δ8 strain ( Figure 6 J and S7 G). Phase 2 cell death occurred ( Figure 6 J). Thus, overexpression of Qrr4 is sufficient to mimic the phenotype caused by the luxO A97E mutation ( Figures 6 F and 6J). We conclude that in our LCD-locked luxO QS variants, it is the Qrr sRNAs that repress T6SS components and activate Vps production. Together, these changes lower cell death and abolish sectoring.
Our data showing that possession of a functional T6SS-injection machine contributes strongly to Phase 1 cell death and that T6SS-killing activity is suppressed by the Vps matrix ( Figure 6 ) suggest that V. cholerae 2740-80 cells in colonies kill neighboring kin cells ( Figure 5 ). To test this prediction, we engineered two strains; V. cholerae 2740-80 Δ vpsL and V. cholerae 2740-80 Δ vasK , each carrying a constitutive lux reporter to enable tracking of cell survival. Each of these luciferase-containing strains was mixed with the non-bioluminescent version of itself. This strategy allowed the bioluminescent strain to be the prey and the otherwise isogenic non-bioluminescent strain to be the predator. For the reference predator-prey control pair, we likewise mixed V. cholerae 2740-80 with V. cholerae 2740-80 lux . Relative to the control, V. cholerae 2740-80 Δ vpsL lux showed the lowest survival and V. cholerae 2740-80 Δ vasK lux displayed the highest survival ( Figure S2 B). Thus, when it possesses a functional T6SS machine, V. cholerae 2740-80 inhibits growth of its nearby genetically identical kin. However, the presence of Vps protects against kin-killing. These findings further confirm the results shown in Figure 6 .
Our data suggest that cell death patterns and sectoring in V. cholerae colonies arise because of spatiotemporal changes in QS, T6SS killing activity, and Vps-mediated defense against T6SS injection. To verify this notion, and as a companion to our activity analyses, we measured transcript levels of QS, T6SS, and Vps production genes in cells obtained from the rims and centers of V. cholerae 2740-80 colonies to determine if they too show particular spatial patterns. The experiment was conducted at 20 h of growth, when V. cholerae 2740-80 colonies are undergoing Phase 1 cell death along the colony rim ( Figure 4 ). As a control, we performed identical analyses with cells obtained from colonies of the V. cholerae 2740-80 luxO A97E strain that is LCD-locked and shows no Phase 1 spatial-temporal cell death pattern ( Figure 6 F).
Regarding V. cholerae 2740-80 colonies, expression of genes located in the major t6ss gene cluster and auxiliary cluster 2 were ∼2- to 5-fold lower in the colony center than at the rim where cell death takes place ( Figure 7 A). Gratifyingly, these two clusters include the vgrG 3- tsiV3 and vasX - tsiV2 genes encoding the E-I protein pairs which we demonstrated mediate Phase 1 cell death ( Figures 5 D–5F). Gene expression from auxiliary clusters 1 and 3 was unchanged or only modestly altered between the rim and interior ( Figure 7 A). By contrast, expression of the QS qrr 4 gene, encoding the Qrr4 sRNA repressor of t6ss genes ( Figure 6 J), and expression of genes involved in Vps production, which defend against incoming T6SS attacks ( Figure 6 C), were ∼3- to 6-fold higher in cells in the colony center than at the rim ( Figure 7 A). To accompany these results, in Figures S8 H and S8I, a QS-controlled transcriptional reporter ( luxC- mNeonGreen ) is quantified in colonies of V. cholerae 2740-80 and shows that HCD QS activity is higher along the rims than in the centers of colonies during Phase 1 cell death.
Regarding V. cholerae 2740-80 luxO A97E colonies, irrespective of location in the colony, expression of each measured t6ss gene was ∼3- to 20-fold lower than in cells from V. cholerae 2740-80 ( Figure 7 A). Levels of the qrr 4 transcript were lower throughout the V. cholerae 2740-80 luxO A97E colony despite ∼100-fold induction of the qrr 4 promoter in this strain ( Figure 2 B). This result is consistent with previous studies showing that in LCD-locked V. cholerae strains, interaction of target mRNAs with the Qrr4 sRNA promotes degradation of Qrr4 ( Lenz et al., 2004 33. Lenz, D.H. ∙ Mok, K.C. ∙ Lilley, B.N. ... The small RNA chaperone Hfq and multiple small RNAs control quorum sensing in Vibrio harveyi and Vibrio cholerae Cell. 2004; 118 :69-82 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (760) PubMed Google Scholar ). Lastly, relative to V. cholerae 2740-80, expression of Vps production genes at the colony rim were ∼2- to 30-fold higher, and at the colony center, they were up to ∼150-fold higher in the V. cholerae 2740-80 luxO A97E strain ( Figure 7 A).
We conclude that during Phase 1 cell death in V. cholerae 2740-80, genes involved in HCD QS and T6SS-killing are expressed at higher levels in cells residing along the rim of the colony than in the center, while cells in the center of the colony express higher levels of genes specifying LCD QS behaviors and T6SS-defense traits (i.e., Vps) than cells at the rim. We propose that these spatially distinct gene expression patterns drive the cell death patterns that occur in V. cholerae 2740-80 colonies. Presumably, differential expression of the same genes also occurs in a temporally distinct manner, as suggested by our data in Figures 4 and 5 , and in Figures S8 H and S8I, but that feature remains to be verified.
Two predictions arise from our findings that QS, T6SS, and Vps genes are expressed in particular spatial, and presumably temporal, patterns in V. cholerae 2740-80 colonies. First, forcing production of T6SS machinery in all cells in V. cholerae 2740-80 colonies would cause cell death across the entire population and eliminate any spatiotemporal pattern. Second, re-establishment of T6SS production in a LCD-locked QS strain would restore cell death and drive sectoring. To test the first prediction, we introduced a plasmid carrying the T6SS activators qstR and tfoX under control of an arabinose inducible promoter (called P t6ss -ON) into V. cholerae 2740-80 ( Bernardy et al., 2016 3. Bernardy, E.E. ∙ Turnsek, M.A. ∙ Wilson, S.K. ... Diversity of Clinical and Environmental Isolates of Vibrio cholerae in Natural Transformation and Contact-Dependent Bacterial Killing Indicative of Type VI Secretion System Activity Appl. Environ.

Independent Regulation of Type VI secretion in Vibrio cholerae by TfoX and TfoY Cell Rep. 2016; 15 :951-958 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ). To test the second prediction, we did the same experiment in the LCD-locked luxO A97E strain. In each case, we monitored cell death and sectoring.
Induction of P t6ss -ON-driven T6SS production caused a 10- to 40-fold increase in cell death in V. cholerae 2740-80 compared to the strain carrying the empty vector ( Figure 7 B, 7C, S8 A, and S8B). Notably, V. cholerae 2740-80 harboring the empty vector displayed the characteristic Phase 1 and Phase 2 cell death patterns, while introduction of P t6ss -ON caused cell death across the colony ( Figures 7 B and 7C). Thus, the normal pattern of cell death that occurs in V. cholerae 2740-80 colonies is a consequence of non-homogeneous t6ss expression and the ensuing non-homogeneous T6SS activity.
Introduction of P t6ss -ON into the luxO A97E strain caused little cell death until ∼40 h, after which cell death became detectable and occurred homogenously across the colony interior ( Figures 7 D–7E, S8 A, and S8B). Once cell death commenced, the level was roughly the same as that in V. cholerae 2740-80 carrying P t6ss -ON. We do not yet understand how repression of cell death is relieved after 40 h in the luxO A97E LCD-locked QS strain. Possibilities include spatial/temporal changes in expression of T6SS-defense genes (Vps) or QS genes (Qrr4) that allow T6SS-killing to occur during later growth times.
Regarding sectoring, V. cholerae 2740-80 carrying P t6ss -ON formed sectors, whereas only minimal sectoring occurred following introduction of P t6ss -ON into the luxO A97E strain, visible as radial streaks ( Figure S8 B. and see also enlarged images in Figure S8 C). We do not understand why sectoring was not fully restored. Likely, plasmid expression of the genes encoding the two T6SS activators does not perfectly mimic native control of the entire set of t6ss gene clusters. Nonetheless, we conclude that QS governs the region-specific expression of Phase 1 T6SS activity, thereby driving cell death and sectoring.
To garner additional evidence demonstrating that both cell death and sectoring are T6SS-dependent in V. cholerae , we used our P t6ss -ON construct to induce t6ss gene expression in V. cholerae C6706, which, as mentioned, does not express t6ss genes under laboratory growth conditions and does not sector ( Figure 2 A). We assessed the consequences to cell death and sectoring. V. cholerae C6706 carrying the empty vector displayed no Phase 1 cell death ( Figures 7 F, top row, and 7G). There was modest Phase 2 cell death, but notably, ∼10-fold lower than that in V. cholerae 2740-80 (compare data in Figure 7 G to that in Figure 7 B). Figures 7 F–7H show that P t6ss -ON-driven T6SS production increased cell death ∼10-fold in V. cholerae C6706. Cell death occurred across the entire colony, consistent with homogeneous expression of t6ss genes. Furthermore, sectors formed with timing similar to that in V. cholerae 2740-80 ( Figure 7 F, bottom row). Thus, high T6SS activity causes cell death and the appearance of sectors in both pandemic ( V. cholerae C6706) and pre-pandemic ( V. cholerae 2740-80) V. cholerae strains.
To discover whether the V. cholerae C6706 T6SS-dependent sectors are enriched in cells with altered QS behaviors, we imaged sectors in a V. cholerae C6706 strain harboring P t6ss -ON, a constitutively produced fluorescent reporter marking live cells (mNeonGreen), and a QS-activated-fluorescent reporter ( luxC -mScarlet). In ∼5%–10% of the sectors, the live cells present did not express the QS reporter, indicating that the cells in these sectors had acquired mutation(s) that result in LCD-locked QS behavior ( Figure 7 I; indicated with white arrows). We conclude that T6SS killing activity in V. cholerae colonies imposes a selective pressure to acquire LCD-locked QS mutations, presumably enhancing growth and promoting sector formation.

Section: Discussion

Here, we discover that QS-controlled T6SS-mediated cell death provides a selective pressure that allows QS-defective strains of V. cholerae to arise that are capable of evading T6SS-killing. T6SS-mediated cell death occurs in a two-phase, spatiotemporal manner. Distinct T6SS effectors, VgrG3 and VasX for Phase 1 and TseL for Phase 2, are required for killing. QS controls Phase 1 cell death and, indeed, the underlying QS, t6ss , and vps genes show regional differences in expression during Phase 1 cell death. Phase 1 cell death is key for sectoring to occur and thus for enhanced genetic diversity to arise in the population (see model in Figure S7 J).
Our findings reveal an unanticipated facet of V. cholerae T6SS biology: the V. cholerae T6SS machinery, which was understood to deliver toxins to non-kin cells, can be deployed to eliminate sibling cells. Thus, the T6SS may have unappreciated roles in intra-specific antagonism. It was surprising that sibling cells succumb to incoming T6SS attacks given that they produce T6SS-effector neutralizing immunity proteins. One previous example of T6SS-dependent kin-killing has been reported in Myxococcus xanthus , in which slow-growing or auxotrophic cells in the population exhibit reduced T6SS protein production, including T6SS immunity proteins, rendering them susceptible to killing by faster growing nearby cells that produce higher levels of T6SS toxins ( Troselj et al., 2018 30. Troselj, V. ∙ Treuner-Lange, A. ∙ Søgaard-Andersen, L. ... Physiological Heterogeneity Triggers Sibling Conflict Mediated by the Type VI Secretion System in an Aggregative Multicellular Bacterium MBio. 2018; 9 :e01645 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ). The Troselj et al. work provides clues to a potential biological rationale for kin-killing in V. cholerae colonies. It is known that cells residing in colonies compete for limited resources, including space and nutrients. One would expect such competition to be most fierce in mature/aged colonies, which is when cell death occurs in V. cholerae colonies. It could be that cells with superior fitness engage in cannibalism. They eliminate less-fit cells in the colony, and in so doing, acquire resources formerly used by (space) or released from (nutrients) the dead cells. One prediction of this notion is that kin-killing would be suppressed when nutrients are plentiful. Indeed, we find that growth in resource-rich nutrient broth suppresses cell death and sectoring ( Figures S8 D–S8G).
V. cholerae colonizes chitinous surfaces in its marine environment, and chitin acts as a cue that activates t6ss gene expression ( Borgeaud et al., 2015 6. Borgeaud, S. ∙ Metzger, L.C. ∙ Scrignari, T. ... The type VI secretion system of Vibrio cholerae fosters horizontal gene transfer Science. 2015; 347 :63-67 Crossref Scopus (267) PubMed Google Scholar ; Meibom et al., 2005 38. Meibom, K.L. ∙ Blokesch, M. ∙ Dolganov, N.A. ... Chitin induces natural competence in Vibrio cholerae Science. 2005; 310 :1824-1827 Crossref Scopus (477) PubMed Google Scholar ). Curiously, clinical and environmental isolates of V. cholerae harbor QS-inactivating mutations at a high frequency ( Joelsson et al., 2006 25. Joelsson, A. ∙ Liu, Z. ∙ Zhu, J. Genetic and Phenotypic Diversity of Quorum-Sensing Systems in Clinical and Environmental Isolates of Vibrio cholerae Infect. Immun. 2006; Crossref Scopus (124) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, interrogation of the QS function of 16 V. cholerae strains revealed that half of the surveyed strains possess dysfunctional QS systems that make the strains display QS LCD-type behaviors. Likewise, among the three original V. cholerae isolates used in our study, two of the strains, V. cholerae V52 and V. cholerae 2740-80, have QS systems that vary in function from the norm ( Figures S2 C–S2E). The mechanism driving the high frequency emergence of QS-dysfunctional strains of V. cholerae has remained mysterious. Our results demonstrate that during laboratory growth, T6SS-killing fosters the emergence of variants with altered QS function in V. cholerae colonies. Given that the T6SS machinery is induced on chitinous surfaces, we propose that T6SS-driven kin-killing likely also occurs in natural habitats and perhaps during disease, and this mechanism propels genetic diversity. It is also intriguing that the arising variant strains exhibit a range of T6SS activity levels and/or capacities to neutralize incoming T6SS attacks ( Figures 6 A, 6C, and S2 F). Such a possibility also exists for the other two variants recovered in our suppressor screen, which acquired mutations affecting CspA and PyrG. CspA, a cold shock protein, modulates T6SS killing activity, while the PyrG cytidine synthase likely influences T6SS function by altering levels of cytidine, a ligand for the CytR transcription factor that activates t6ss genes and represses biofilm formation genes ( Barbier et al., 1997 2. Barbier, C.S. ∙ Short, S.A. ∙ Senear, D.F. Allosteric Mechanism of Induction of CytR-regulated Gene Expression J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272 :16962-16971 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ; Townsley et al., 2016 53. Townsley, L. ∙ Sison Mangus, M.P. ∙ Mehic, S. ...

CytR Is a Global Positive Regulator of Competence, Type VI Secretion, and Chitinases in Vibrio cholerae PLoS One. 2015; 10 , e0138834 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, T6SS-driven intra-specific antagonism selects for acquisition of mutations in QS and other pathways that modify expression of t6ss offensive and defensive genes in V. cholerae . This mechanism could enable iterative improvements in tuning of T6SS activity to various niches. Indeed, this notion is best illustrated by HapR A52T ( Figures 2 B–2D and S2 F) which has distinct effects on different HapR target promoters. Pertinent to our study, the strain carrying HapR A52T does not repress vps genes, exhibits increased T6SS activity, and displays wildtype HapR behavior in driving QS genes. Thus, V. cholerae 2740-80 hapR A52T may be “optimized” with respect to its balance between offensive and defensive capacities, while continuing to be able to communicate with its bacterial neighbors.
We discovered that T6SS-driven Phase 1 cell killing relies on the T6SS VasK-dependent injection machinery ( Figure 5 I). Curiously, combining the Δ8 mutation, which eliminates all effectors, with the Δ vasK mutation, eliminating the injection apparatus, had a modest additive effect with respect to cell death (additivity is best visualized in Figures S7 B–S7D). Two possible explanations occur to us. First, despite lacking T6SS toxins, the Δ8 strain nonetheless possesses an intact T6SS injection machine. It is possible that a subset of cells in the colony have damaged cell envelopes, rendering them susceptible to harm upon physical penetration by the T6SS needle, which is expelled with considerable energy into target cells ( Kamal et al., 2020 28.

Wang, J. ∙ Brodmann, M. ∙ Basler, M. Assembly and Subcellular Localization of Bacterial Type VI Secretion Systems Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2019; 73 :621-638 Crossref Scopus (76) PubMed Google Scholar ). Emphasizing this line of thought, a recent study found that V. cholerae cells possessing only the injection machinery, but no effectors, can inhibit the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains lacking the TolB protein, which is important for maintaining outer membrane integrity ( Kamal et al., 2020 28. Kamal, F. ∙ Liang, X. ∙ Manera, K. ... Differential Cellular response to translocated toxic effectors and physical penetration by the Type VI Secretion System Cell Rep. 2020; 31 , 107766 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ). A second possibility is that the V. cholerae Δ8 strain continues to synthesize an as-yet-unidentified effector toxin that employs the T6SS injection apparatus for its killing activity.
Phase 2 cell killing required the T6SS TseL effector toxin but not the T6SS injection machinery ( Figures 5 C and 5I). It is currently unclear whether TseL causes self-killing or if it can be secreted via an alternate secretion mechanism. In support of the notion that TseL contributes to self-killing, Ho et al. (2017) 21. Ho, B.T. ∙ Fu, Y. ∙ Dong, T.G. ... Vibrio cholerae type 6 secretion system effector trafficking in target bacterial cells Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :9427-9432 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar showed that TseL can be trafficked from the cytosol to the periplasm via a non-T6SS-dependent mechanism. Thus, one possibility is that time- and region-specific trafficking of TseL to the periplasmic compartment promotes Phase 2 cell death. TseL is a phospholipase ( Dong et al., 2013 10. Dong, T.G. ∙ Ho, B.T. ∙ Yoder-Himes, D.R. ... Identification of T6SS-dependent effector and immunity proteins by Tn-seq in Vibrio cholerae Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110 :2623-2628 Crossref Scopus (217) PubMed Google Scholar ). An alternative possibility is that TseL residing in the cytoplasm destroys essential cytoplasmic factor(s), such as precursors in phospholipid biosynthesis, the absence of which would cause cell death.
In multicellular organisms, including humans, key segments of development rely on genetically regulated and time- and region-specific cell death processes ( Fink and Cookson, 2005 14. Fink, S.L. ∙ Cookson, B.T. Apoptosis, Pyroptosis, and Necrosis: Mechanistic Description of Dead and Dying Eukaryotic Cells Infect. Immun. 2005; 73 :1907-1916 Crossref Scopus (1648) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kerr et al., 1972 29. Kerr, J.F.R. ∙ Wyllie, A.H. ∙ Currie, A.R. Apoptosis: A Basic Biological Phenomenon with Wide-ranging Implications in Tissue Kinetics Br. J. Cancer. 1972; 26 :239-257 Crossref Scopus (13401) PubMed Google Scholar ). In a striking parallel, we show here that cell death in V. cholerae colonies is QS-regulated and occurs in a time- and region-specific manner. Cell death wave(s) were recently reported to guide eukaryotic apoptosis in Xenopus laevis (African frog) eggs ( Cheng and Ferrell, 2018 8. Cheng, X. ∙ Ferrell, J.E. Apoptosis propagates through the cytoplasm as trigger waves Science. 2018; 361 :607-612 Crossref Scopus (104) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our time-lapse videos and kymograph analyses hint that in V. cholerae , cell death during Phase 2 may also propagate as a wave (see especially Video S1 ). Although it is currently speculative, if correct, this feature would mirror what occurs in eukaryotes. We are currently exploring the origin of the wave-like behavior observed here.
Beyond the V. cholerae cell death patterns revealed here, recent studies show that other bacterial communities also display patterns. For example, in B. subtilis colony biofilms, genes involved in the nitrogen stress response are expressed in a concentric ring-like pattern. Intriguingly, similar to what we show here, the B. subtilis patterns occur in mature colonies and nutrient levels are key ( Chou et al., 2022 9. Chou, K.-T. ∙ Lee, D.-Y.D. ∙ Chiou, J.-G. ... A segmentation clock patterns cellular differentiation in a bacterial biofilm Cell. 2022; 185 :145-157.e13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cells in P. aeruginosa colony biofilms are reported to organize into concentric ring-like zones with each ring displaying a different metabolic capacity. Ring formation is controlled by light and temperature stimulation ( Kahl et al., 2022 27. Kahl, L.J. ∙ Eckartt, K.N. ∙ Morales, D.K. ... Light/Dark and Temperature Cycling Modulate Metabolic Electron Flow in Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilms mBio. 2022; 13 :e0140722 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Regarding the sequential timing of the two phases of cell death in V. cholerae 2740-80, we note that Phase 2 cell death commences only after Phase 1 death subsides. Also, in QS LCD-locked strains ( luxO A97E or V. cholerae 2740-80 carrying Ptac- qrr 4), which lack Phase 1 cell death, the timing of onset of Phase 2 cell death shifts dramatically, initiating ∼24 h earlier than in a strain that is wildtype for QS (compare timing in Figure 6 D to that in Figure 6 J). Thus, it appears that the timing and occurrence of Phase 1 killing sets the timing of Phase 2 killing. Possibly, Phase 1 killing, which occurs at the colony rim among the youngest members of the colony, functions to delay cell death in the population elders; as Phase 2 killing occurs in the colony interior which contains the oldest cells in the colony. Possibly, cells undergoing death at the colony rim release a “defer/delay” signal that is detected by cells in the colony interior. By alerting older cells to impending cell death, such a signal could function to buy them time to protect themselves. If so, such a scenario would present another fascinating parallel to eukaryotic cell death where, following initiation of apoptosis, dying cells release chemical signals that are detected by stem cells, prompting the stem cells (which are the oldest cells in eukaryotic tissue communities) to mount defenses that ensure their survival and, in turn, their capacity for future tissue re-population ( Xing et al., 2015 58. Xing, Y. ∙ Su, T.T. ∙ Ruohola-Baker, H. Tie-mediated signal from apoptotic cells protects stem cells in Drosophila melanogaster Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 :7058 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Our work shows that QS and T6SS mediate spatiotemporal cell death in Vibrio cholerae and Phase 1 cell death is underpinned by regionally distinct patterns of expression of QS, t6ss and vps genes. It would be fascinating to assess gene expression patterns and production/activities of QS, Vps, and T6SS components at the level of individual cells. However, currently imaging on agar surfaces precludes such single cell level analyses. In the future, when technologically feasible, gene expression and cell death patterns should be quantified with single cell resolution in V. cholerae colonies. Our findings in Figures 7 A and 7I and Figures S8 H and S8I show that community-wide gene expression occurs in spatially heterogeneous patterns. Our initial explorations suggest that gene expression patterns are altered temporally ( Figures S8 H and S8I), but this point remains to be tested rigorously.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae and E. coli Top10 were used for cloning. E. coli S17-1 λ pir was used for conjugations. Cultures of V. cholerae and E. coli were grown in LB medium at 37°C with shaking, with a headspace to growth medium volume ratio of 7. The only exception is that prey strains for killing assays were grown overnight at 30°C. When required, media were supplemented with streptomycin, 200 μg/mL; kanamycin 50 μg/mL; polymyxin B, 50 μg/mL; chloramphenicol, 1 μg/mL; spectinomycin, 200 μg/mL. In experiments requiring induction of gene expression, all media used were supplemented with 0.1% arabinose. All V. cholerae assays were performed at 30°C unless otherwise noted. LB medium (both liquid and solid) was prepared with dd H 2 O, 100% Tap H 2 O, or 80% Tap and 20% dd H 2 O. Changes in media preparation were a consequence of COVID-imposed supply issues and LB reagent acquired from multiple suppliers. Differences in batches affected the timing of assays and amount of sectoring. Consistent phenotypes could be obtained when solid LB medium was prepared with 80% Tap and 20% dd H 2 O and liquid LB medium was prepared with 100% Tap H 2 O. Bioluminescence-reporter assays were conducted as previously described ( Mashruwala and Bassler, 2020 35. Mashruwala, A.A. ∙ Bassler, B.L. The Vibrio cholerae Quorum-Sensing Protein VqmA Integrates Cell Density, Environmental, and Host-Derived Cues into the Control of Virulence mBio. 2020; 11 :e01572-20 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ). Where indicated, relative light units (RLU) denote bioluminescence output divided by the culture optical density.
Chromosomal alterations in V. cholerae strains were introduced using the pRE112 suicide vector harboring the counter-selectable sacB gene as previously described ( Edwards et al., 1998 12.

All strains used in the study are listed in the Key Resources Table . Unless otherwise specified, chromosomal DNA from V. cholerae 2740-80 was used as template for PCR reactions. Plasmids were constructed using pBAD-pEVS or pRE112 as backbones and assembled using enzyme-free XthA-dependent in vivo recombination cloning or yeast-recombination-assisted assembly as previously described ( Beyer et al., 2015 4.

Plasmids were introduced into V. cholerae strains by conjugation with E. coli S17-1 λ pir . Plasmids used in this work are listed in the Key Resources Table .
Kits for gel purification, plasmid-preparation, RNA-preparation (RNeasy), qRT-PCR, and RNA-Protect reagent were purchased from Qiagen. iProof DNA polymerase and deoxynucleoside triphosphates were purchased from Biorad.
A 700 μL aliquot of an overnight culture of V. cholerae was combined with 4 mm glass beads in an Eppendorf tube and subjected to vortex for 5 min to disperse aggregates. The culture was diluted with PBS to a final OD 600 of 0.5. The sample was again subjected to vortex, without glass beads, for 5 min. A 1 μL aliquot of this suspension was spotted onto 35 mL of solid LB agar in a one well plate and allowed to dry for 5 min at room temperature. The plate was incubated for the remainder of the assay at 30°C. Up to 24 such samples were aliquoted onto each agar pad. Sector formation became visible between 18 and 48 h. When required, the LB agar medium was supplemented with 2 μM SytoX dye (ThermoFisher) ( Asally et al., 2012 1. Asally, M. ∙ Kittisopikul, M. ∙ Rué, P. ... Localized cell death focuses mechanical forces during 3D patterning in a biofilm Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109 :18891-18896 18891–18896 Crossref Scopus (252) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Prey cells constitutively expressed the luxCDABE operon, incorporated onto the chromosome ( V. cholerae ) or a plasmid ( E. coli Top10). Prey cell light production was quantified to track surviving cells. To initiate the killing assay, 800 μL of overnight cultures of prey and predator strains were concentrated 2-fold by centrifugation and resuspension in 400 μL PBS. The predator cell suspension was combined with 4 mm glass beads in an Eppendorf tube and subjected to vortex for 5 min to disperse aggregates. In experiments in which effects of Vps production on T6SS-driven killing were examined, rather than apply vortex, cells were gently resuspended with a pipette to preserve biofilm structures. In the case of prey, cultures were divided in half. One-half was subjected to vortex, as described above, and used to obtain the OD 600 measurement. The other half of the culture was used as the prey cells. Predator and prey suspensions were diluted to a final OD 600 of 3 with PBS. Subsequently, 4 μL of prey cell suspension were combined with 16 μL of predator cell suspension and subjected to gentle pulse-vortex to mix. 1 μL of such cell suspensions were applied in a 12 x 8 grid arrangement in a one-well plate containing 35 mL of LB agar. Up to 24 samples were spotted onto the agar in each one well plate. Samples were allowed to dry for 5 min at room temperature. Subsequently, the plate was incubated in a Biospa Automated Incubator (Biotek) at 30°C and the bioluminescence from prey cells was quantified over time using a Synergy Neo 2 plate reader (Biotek). Under these assay conditions, maximal T6SS-driven killing of the Δ8 prey strain occurred at ∼125 min ( Figure S2 G). Data from this time-point are presented in the bar graphs in Figures 6 A and 6C.
V. cholerae strains were diluted from freezer stocks into 3 mL of LB medium and cultured for 3–6 h until turbidity occurred (OD 600 = 1–2). The cells were collected by centrifugation and DNA was purified from them using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit (Qiagen, Germany). Subsequently, the DNA was processed and sequenced. Variant calling to identify SNPs of interest was performed by the Microbial Genome Sequencing Center (Pittsburgh, PA). V. cholerae N16961 was used as the reference genome.
Strains were cultured for ∼18 h as described in the colony sectoring assay section. Subsequently, colonies were resuspended in PBS, 4 mm glass beads were added, and the suspension subjected to vortex for 5 min to disperse aggregates. The resulting cell suspension was treated for 15 min at room temperature with RNAProtect reagent per the manufacturer’s instructions. Thereafter, RNA isolation, cDNA library preparation, and qPCR was performed as described previously ( Mashruwala and Bassler, 2020 35. Mashruwala, A.A. ∙ Bassler, B.L. The Vibrio cholerae Quorum-Sensing Protein VqmA Integrates Cell Density, Environmental, and Host-Derived Cues into the Control of Virulence mBio. 2020; 11 :e01572-20 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Colonies were plated as described in the colony sectoring assay section. Thereafter, images of growing colonies were acquired using a Cytation 7 imaging plate reader (Biotek) using the attached temperature-controlled incubator at 30°C and a 4× air objective. Live-cell distribution was monitored using intensity from a chromosomally-integrated fluorescent reporter that constitutively produced the mKO protein (ex: 500 nm). Dead-cell distribution was monitored using staining intensity from SytoX (ex: 556 nm). The focal plane was maintained using the laser autofocus method. For each time point and in each acquisition channel, a 3x3 xy -montage of the colony was obtained and stitched together using the linear blend algorithm to form a single image. In every case, a depth of between 225 and 500 μm was sectioned. Maximum intensity z -projections were generated for each time point using the Biotek Gen5 software.
Colonies were plated as described above in the colony sectoring assay section. Following 2–3 days of growth, images were acquired using a Leica M125 stereo-microscope with a Leica MC170 HD camera.
Projections of time-lapse data were obtained using customized Fiji scripts that performed the following sequence of events: First, image background subtraction was performed using a rolling ball radius of 1,000 pixels. Second, to account for shifts during imaging, the sequence of images was registered using the MultiStackReg Fiji plugin and the Rigid Body algorithm. Next, the registered image sequences were collapsed using maximum intensity projections. Ratio images were obtained using the Fiji Image calculator tool to divide pixel intensities across the entire image of the dead-cell channel by that for the live-cell channel. The grayscale time-projections and ratio images were pseudo-colored using Red (live channel), Cyan (dead channel) or Mpl-inferno (ratio image) look-up tables. To aid in visualization, the time-projection images were cropped at the colony boundaries and pixel intensities outside the colony boundaries were set to zero.
Time-projection images for the first 38 h of colony growth were segmented and analyzed using the Fiji Trainable Weka Segmentation tool. First, a classifier model was trained to discriminate between the sectored and non-sectored regions of the colonies. The training dataset consisted of 25 time-projection images from the dead-cell channel using images of both parent and mutant colonies from experiments performed on multiple days. Using a custom Fiji script, the resulting classifier model was applied to time-projection images to obtain probability images in which each pixel in an image was assigned a probability of belonging to a particular image class. Regions of interest (ROI) were extracted from these probability images by thresholding using the RenyiEntropy algorithm followed by application of a combination of the filter and the particle size cutoff tools which were customized for each segmentation class. The obtained ROIs were manually curated for mis-segmentation, and the curated ROIs were used in measurements of area or intensities from the time-projection or the ratio images.
Fluorescence time-course images of colony growth were analyzed using a custom MATLAB script. First, the center of the colony was located with an iterative centroid-finding algorithm using the fluorescent channel that monitored live cells, beginning at the first image acquisition at 8 h. To eliminate occasional sudden shifts due to mechanical noise, the sequence of images was registered in the x , y plane without rotation correction. Next, spatiotemporal fluorescence intensities in both the live- and dead-cell channels were extracted for kymograph analyses as follows: A region of interest consisting of a radial section, akin to a pie slice, was specified and manually verified to lack sectoring. Colony boundaries were determined using a fixed intensity threshold for the maximum fluorescence signals. Pixel intensities from both the live- and dead-cell channels were averaged in the circumferential direction within the radial section to obtain the averaged fluorescence intensity profile along the colony radius and over time. The obtained intensity values were used to construct kymograph profiles quantifying the space-time development of live and dead cells within the colony.
Sample variances were calculated using Excel. Statistical significance was calculated using a two-tailed Student’s t test appropriate for the sample variance.
