Title: β-Coronaviruses Use Lysosomes for Egress Instead of the Biosynthetic Secretory Pathway


Abstract: Summary

β-Coronaviruses are a family of positive-strand enveloped RNA viruses that includes the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Much is known regarding their cellular entry and replication pathways, but their mode of egress remains uncertain. Using imaging methodologies and virus-specific reporters, we demonstrate that β-coronaviruses utilize lysosomal trafficking for egress rather than the biosynthetic secretory pathway more commonly used by other enveloped viruses. This unconventional egress is regulated by the Arf-like small GTPase Arl8b and can be blocked by the Rab7 GTPase competitive inhibitor CID1067700. Such non-lytic release of β-coronaviruses results in lysosome deacidification, inactivation of lysosomal degradation enzymes, and disruption of antigen presentation pathways. β-Coronavirus-induced exploitation of lysosomal organelles for egress provides insights into the cellular and immunological abnormalities observed in patients and suggests new therapeutic modalities.

Section: Introduction

β-Coronaviruses are positive-strand enveloped RNA viruses that comprise one of the four genera of the Coronaviridae family of viruses. β-Coronaviruses infect humans and other mammals, with infection resulting in a range of diseases with considerable morbidity and mortality. In late 2019, one member, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), originating in bats, spread to humans and caused a worldwide pandemic ( Lu et al., 2020 42.

Genomic characterisation and epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding Lancet. 2020; 395 :565-574 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (8469) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The ability of these viruses to infect many different cell types, including those of the pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatic, gastrointestinal, central nervous, and immune systems, results in complex multi-organ disease manifestations that can vary from individual to individual ( Puelles et al., 2020 58. Puelles, V.G. ∙ Lütgehetmann, M. ∙ Lindenmeyer, M.T. ... Multiorgan and Renal Tropism of SARS-CoV-2 N. Engl. J. Med. 2020; 383 :590-592 Crossref Scopus (1342) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ziegler et al., 2020 87. Ziegler, C.G.K. ∙ Allon, S.J. ∙ Nyquist, S.K. ..., HCA Lung Biological Network.

Especially with regard to the immune system, these viruses appear to deregulate the traditional innate and adaptive immune responses to pathogens ( Vardhana and Wolchok, 2020 80. Vardhana, S.A. ∙ Wolchok, J.D. The many faces of the anti-COVID immune response J. Exp. Med. 2020; 217 :e20200678 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Currently there is no cure, and the antiviral treatment options are few ( Williamson et al., 2020 84. Williamson, B.N. ∙ Feldmann, F. ∙ Schwarz, B. ... Clinical benefit of remdesivir in rhesus macaques infected with SARS-CoV-2 Nature. 2020; 585 :273-276 Crossref Scopus (487) PubMed Google Scholar ), and whether lasting immune responses can be generated to infection by natural means or through vaccine administration remains open to question ( Long et al., 2020 40. Long, Q.X. ∙ Tang, X.J. ∙ Shi, Q.L. ... Clinical and immunological assessment of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections Nat. Med. 2020; 26 :1200-1204 Crossref Scopus (2058) PubMed Google Scholar ).
One of the major reasons for the lack of antiviral therapies is the paucity of knowledge regarding the β-coronavirus-host cell interface. When the viral envelope fuses with the plasma membrane and/or endosome membranes, and the viral RNA genome is released into the cytosol, it translates into nonstructural and structural proteins. The nonstructural proteins assemble on endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived membranes and replicate the viral RNA ( Snijder et al., 2006 68. Snijder, E.J. ∙ van der Meer, Y. ∙ Zevenhoven-Dobbe, J. ...

Although a large amount of molecular detail is known regarding coronavirus entry and replication, very little is known regarding how the newly assembled coronaviruses egress from cells, including which cellular pathways they exploit and whether they induce cell lysis ( Fung and Liu, 2019 23.

The egress pathway for all β-coronaviruses starts with newly synthesized viral genomic RNA, coated with viral N proteins, budding into the lumen of the ER and the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) ( Cohen et al., 2011 14.

This results in viral particles enveloped with host membranes containing viral M, E, and S transmembrane structural proteins ( de Haan et al., 1998 18. de Haan, C.A. ∙ Kuo, L. ∙ Masters, P.S. ...

When in the ER/ERGIC, virus particles traffic to the Golgi apparatus and trans -Golgi network (TGN) for glycosylation and other post-translational modifications ( Fung and Liu, 2018 22.

Cell Biol. 1987; 105 :1215-1226 Crossref Scopus (125) PubMed Google Scholar ). But after the Golgi apparatus/TGN, it has been assumed that coronaviruses use vesicles of the biosynthetic secretory pathway to track to the plasma membrane and egress ( Machamer, 2013 43. Machamer, C.E. Accommodation of large cargo within Golgi cisternae Histochem. Cell Biol. 2013; 140 :261-269 Crossref Scopus (12) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tooze et al., 1987 76.

Cell Biol. 1987; 105 :1215-1226 Crossref Scopus (125) PubMed Google Scholar ), similar to other enveloped RNA viruses, such as hepatitis C virus, dengue virus, and West Nile virus ( Ravindran et al., 2016 60. Ravindran, M.S. ∙ Bagchi, P. ∙ Cunningham, C.N. ... Opportunistic intruders: how viruses orchestrate ER functions to infect cells Nat. Rev.

Viral journeys on the intracellular highways Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2018; 75 :3693-3714 Crossref Scopus (66) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Here we investigated the egress pathway of β-coronaviruses and found that, rather than the biosynthetic secretory pathway, these viruses use a lysosomal, Arl8b-dependent exocytic pathway for release into the extracellular environment. We show that GRP78/BIP, an ER chaperone that facilitates coronavirus infectivity ( Chu et al., 2018 13. Chu, H. ∙ Chan, C.M. ∙ Zhang, X. ... Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and bat coronavirus HKU9 both can utilize GRP78 for attachment onto host cells J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293 :11709-11726 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (132) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ha et al., 2020 29. Ha, D.P. ∙ Van Krieken, R. ∙ Carlos, A.J. ... The stress-inducible molecular chaperone GRP78 as potential therapeutic target for coronavirus infection J. Infect. 2020; 81 :452-482 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ), is co-released with β-coronaviruses through this pathway. As a consequence of viral exploitation of lysosomal exocytosis, we demonstrate that late endosomes/lysosomes are deacidified and lysosomal proteases are inactive. Significantly, we show that this perturbation of lysosome physiology has important functional consequences on the host cell, including disruption of antigen presentation pathways.

Section: Results

We began investigating the mechanism of β-coronavirus egress using mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), as it is the prototype of the family that can be studied under biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) conditions, with intranasal MHV infection in mice inducing pathogenesis similar to SARS, including acute pneumonia, lung injury, and hepatic and neurological disease ( Channappanavar et al., 2016 10.

Developing MHV-1 infection as an animal model for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) (43.30) J. Immunol. 2007; 178 :S42 Google Scholar ).
First we investigated the kinetics of replication and egress in this model system. HeLa-ATCC cells stably expressing murine CEACAM1 (HeLa-mCC1a) were infected with the MHV-A59 strain virus. Cell lysates and extracellular medium were collected at different intervals and processed for quantitative PCR (qPCR) determination of viral genomic RNA. The results were plotted as fold change over uninfected cell lysates and extracellular medium ( Figure 1 A). We found that the replication rate was highest until 8 h post infection (pi) and then plateaued. Virus egress was highest from 8–12 h pi before leveling off at 14 h pi ( Figure 1 A). The extracellular genomic RNA (i.e., egressed virus), released between 8 and 14 h pi, was infectious and could be titered ( Figure S1 A). Notably, viral egress took place in the absence of any cell lysis because there was no significant change in the permeability of the plasma membrane to the membrane-impermeant cell viability dyes trypan blue and propidium iodide when the virus accumulated extracellularly ( Figure 1 B; Figures S1 B and S1C).
β-Coronaviruses are widely thought to use the biosynthetic secretory pathway for egress. Given this, we next interrogated the status of the secretory pathway in infected cells and whether this pathway was utilized for MHV egress. Cells were transfected with Gaussia luciferase, a reporter for the biosynthetic secretory pathway ( Tannous, 2009 73. Tannous, B.A. Gaussia luciferase reporter assay for monitoring biological processes in culture and in vivo Nat. Protoc. 2009; 4 :582-591 Crossref Scopus (227) PubMed Google Scholar ), and infected with MHV or left uninfected. We confirmed that Gaussia luciferase transfection of cells did not block their subsequent infection by MHV ( Figure S1 D). Extracellular luciferase levels were measured by luminescence, and released viral genomes were quantified by qPCR ( Figure 1 C). We found that the kinetics of Gaussia luciferase secretion was not altered significantly throughout the MHV egress period, consistent with previous reports ( Machamer, 2013 43. Machamer, C.E. Accommodation of large cargo within Golgi cisternae Histochem. Cell Biol. 2013; 140 :261-269 Crossref Scopus (12) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tooze et al., 1987 76. Tooze, J. ∙ Tooze, S.A. ∙ Fuller, S.D. Sorting of progeny coronavirus from condensed secretory proteins at the exit from the trans-Golgi network of AtT20 cells J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105 :1215-1226 Crossref Scopus (125) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Given that the secretory pathway remained operational, we next asked whether β-coronaviruses utilized it for egress. We treated Gaussia luciferase transfected cells with Brefeldin A (BFA), a small molecule that rapidly shuts down all anterograde biosynthetic secretory traffic from the ER/ERGIC out to the plasma membrane and leads to resorption of the Golgi apparatus into the ER ( Lippincott-Schwartz et al., 1989 39. Lippincott-Schwartz, J. ∙ Yuan, L.C. ∙ Bonifacino, J.S. ... Rapid redistribution of Golgi proteins into the ER in cells treated with brefeldin A: evidence for membrane cycling from Golgi to ER Cell. 1989; 56 :801-813 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1506) PubMed Google Scholar ; Miller et al., 1992 50. Miller, S.G. ∙ Carnell, L. ∙ Moore, H.H. Post-Golgi membrane traffic: brefeldin A inhibits export from distal Golgi compartments to the cell surface but not recycling J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118 :267-283 Crossref Scopus (189) PubMed Google Scholar ). The uninfected/ Gaussia luciferase-transfected and MHV-infected/ Gaussia luciferase-transfected cells were treated with or without BFA at 6, 8, and 10 h pi, and extracellular media were collected at 14 h pi. This resulted in 8, 6, and 4 h of total BFA treatment time, respectively. From these collected media, Gaussia luciferase and MHV extracellular genomic RNA levels were quantified and plotted simultaneously ( Figure 1 D). Remarkably, the presence of BFA, from 6 h pi onward, did not affect MHV egress; neither quantification of extracellular viral genomic RNA ( Figure 1 D) nor viral titers ( Figure S1 A) of BFA-treated cells showed any significant change relative to untreated infected cells. The secretory pathway was sensitive to BFA in MHV-infected cells because the Golgi apparatus was completely disrupted ( Figure 1 E), and Gaussia luciferase secretion was blocked ( Figure 1 D). Furthermore, the viral egress observed was not due to cell lysis, irrespective of BFA treatment ( Figure S1 E). Thus, MHV could egress even when trafficking through the biosynthetic secretory pathway was blocked.
We then investigated the spatiotemporal distribution of MHV during egress to identify which cellular trafficking pathway it exploited. The M protein is the most abundant protein in the envelope of β-coronaviruses and drives virus assembly, membrane curvature, and budding into the ER/ERGIC by oligomerizing with itself and with viral RNA, N, E, and S proteins ( de Haan and Rottier, 2005 17. de Haan, C.A.M. ∙ Rottier, P.J.M.

The coronavirus E protein: assembly and beyond Viruses. 2012; 4 :363-382 Crossref Scopus (211) PubMed Google Scholar ). Immunolabeling cells at peak egress (12 h pi) with the J1.3 monoclonal anti-M antibody ( Narayanan et al., 2000 53. Narayanan, K. ∙ Maeda, A. ∙ Maeda, J. ... Characterization of the coronavirus M protein and nucleocapsid interaction in infected cells J. Virol. 2000; 74 :8127-8134 Crossref Scopus (201) PubMed Google Scholar ; Stohlman et al., 1982 70. Stohlman, S.A. ∙ Brayton, P.R. ∙ Fleming, J.O. ... Murine coronaviruses: isolation and characterization of two plaque morphology variants of the JHM neurotropic strain J. Gen. Virol. 1982; 63 :265-275 Crossref Scopus (75) PubMed Google Scholar ) and subsequent immunoelectron microscopy revealed antibody labeling to be concentrated 3-fold more on the envelopes of viral particles compared with membranes elsewhere (ER, ERGIC, Golgi apparatus, etc.) ( Figure 1 F; Figure S2 A). The J1.3 antibody may recognize free M proteins, but our quantitative analysis of electron micrographs indicated that the antibody mostly detected M in the context of assembled particles. In addition, consistent with recognition of assembled virus particles, MHV(M J1.3 ) antibody labeling colocalized with E and S envelope proteins throughout infection ( Figure 1 G; Figures S2 B and S2C).
We infected cells with MHV, washed off the virus, and fixed the cells at different times post-inoculation. We co-stained the fixed cells with anti-MHV(M J1.3 ), anti-E, and other antibodies against organelle-resident host proteins. At 6 h pi, consistent with previous reports showing newly synthesized viruses trafficking to the Golgi apparatus and TGN at the early stages of infection ( Machamer, 2013 43. Machamer, C.E. Accommodation of large cargo within Golgi cisternae Histochem. Cell Biol. 2013; 140 :261-269 Crossref Scopus (12) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tooze et al., 1987 76. Tooze, J. ∙ Tooze, S.A. ∙ Fuller, S.D. Sorting of progeny coronavirus from condensed secretory proteins at the exit from the trans-Golgi network of AtT20 cells J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105 :1215-1226 Crossref Scopus (125) PubMed Google Scholar ), MHV(M J1.3 ) labeling was perinuclear ( Figure 1 G, 6 h pi) and colocalized with TGN46, Golgin 97, and mannosidase II by immunofluorescence ( Figures S2 D–S2F).
However, at 12 h pi, the bulk of the MHV(M J1.3 ) labeling was no longer perinuclear and did not colocalize with these Golgi apparatus/TGN markers ( Figures S2 D–S2F). Instead, it was concentrated in puncta dispersed across the cytoplasm ( Figure 1 G, 12 h pi). The late endosomal/lysosomal transmembrane protein LAMP1 ( Figure 1 H, 12 h pi) and lumenal enzyme cathepsin D ( Figure S2 G) were colocalized with many of the MHV(M J1.3 )-labeled puncta. We quantified the colocalization of fluorescence signals in the MHV(M J1.3 ) and LAMP1 channels ( Manders et al., 1993 44. Manders, E.M.M. ∙ Verbeek, F.J. ∙ Aten, J.A. Measurement of co localization of objects in duaå colour confocal images J. Microsc. 1993; 169 :375-382 Crossref Scopus (1678) PubMed Google Scholar ), which revealed an ~5-fold increase in LAMP1 + / MHV + organelles during the egress period ( Figure 1 I). MHV(M J1.3 ) puncta not with LAMP1 were localized to the ER ( Figure S2 H). In SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero E6 cells, M labeling could also be detected within LAMP1 + organelles ( Figure 1 J).
We then fractionated MHV-infected cells at 12 h pi using Nycodenz gradients ( Graham et al., 1990 27. Graham, J.M. ∙ Ford, T. ∙ Rickwood, D. Isolation of the major subcellular organelles from mouse liver using Nycodenz gradients without the use of an ultracentrifuge Anal. Biochem. 1990; 187 :318-323 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ) and quantified MHV genomic content in each fraction by qPCR. This revealed viral genomic RNA to be enriched in the LAMP1 + fractions (2 and 3), which correspond to late endosomes/lysosomes, and in ERGIC53 + fractions (4 and 5), corresponding to Golgi apparatus/ER/ERGIC membranes, where MHV replication takes place ( Figures 1 K and 1L; Figures S3 A and S3B). In contrast, a similar fractionation done on poliovirus-infected HeLa cells revealed poliovirus to be enriched in ERGIC53 + /LC3 + fractions but not in LAMP1 + fractions ( Figure S3 C), a result consistent with poliovirus using ER/Golgi apparatus/ERGIC-derived autophagosomes for egress that are blocked from fusing with lysosomes ( Chen et al., 2015 11. Chen, Y.H. ∙ Du, W. ∙ Hagemeijer, M.C. ... Phosphatidylserine vesicles enable efficient en bloc transmission of enteroviruses Cell. 2015; 160 :619-630 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (352) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The LAMP1 + fractions are a mixture of lysosomes and late endosomes that overlap in many membrane and lumenal proteins ( Huotari and Helenius, 2011 31. Huotari, J. ∙ Helenius, A. Endosome maturation EMBO J. 2011; 30 :3481-3500 Crossref Scopus (1794) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR) mainly cycles between late endosomes and the Golgi apparatus/TGN ( Brown et al., 1986 6. Brown, W.J. ∙ Goodhouse, J. ∙ Farquhar, M.G. Mannose-6-phosphate receptors for lysosomal enzymes cycle between the Golgi complex and endosomes J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103 :1235-1247 Crossref Scopus (210) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, in poliovirus-infected cells, CI-MPR was detectable throughout fractions 2–5, reflecting this broad distribution ( Figure S3 C). In MHV-infected cells, it was mostly detectable in fraction 5 ( Figure S3 B). Consistent with this, imaging of MHV-infected cells coimmunostained with anti-CI-MPR and anti-LAMP1 antibodies revealed a 3-fold decrease in colocalization between CI-MPR and LAMP1 relative to uninfected cells ( Figures S3 D and S3E). This suggests that, in infected cells, MHV is largely associated with lysosomes and/or atypical late endosomes.
Significantly, MHV association with the lysosome fractions was not a result of endocytic reuptake of egressed virus. When infected cells were treated with Dyngo-4a, a potent inhibitor of endocytosis ( Park et al., 2013 55. Park, R.J. ∙ Shen, H. ∙ Liu, L. ... Dynamin triple knockout cells reveal off target effects of commonly used dynamin inhibitors J. Cell Sci. 2013; 126 :5305-5312 Crossref Scopus (194) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure S3 F) during egress, the quantity of MHV genomic RNA associated with the LAMP1 + fractions remained significant ( Figure 1 L).
Using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and immunoelectron microscopy (immuno-EM) methodologies, which have a resolution of a few nanometers, we further interrogated the association between β-coronaviruses and lysosomes in MHV- and SARS-CoV-2-infected cells ( Figure 2 ). By TEM, lysosomes can be easily recognized by specific hallmarks, such as intralumenal electron dense material and intralumenal membrane swirls ( Fawcett, 1966 20. Fawcett, D.W. The Cell W.B. Saunders, 1966 Google Scholar ). TEM of MHV- or SARS-CoV-2-infected cells during the egress stage revealed many such organelles filled with intact viruses of typical 70- to 90-nm particle size. These organelles were likely lysosomes because they displayed all of the physiological hallmarks ( Figures 2 A–2C). Immuno-EM against native LAMP1 revealed this protein to be on the membrane of these virus-filled organelles ( Figure 2 B), further confirming the colocalization of LAMP1 and MHV(M J1.3 ) observed by confocal imaging ( Figures 1 H–1J) and the biochemical association between LAMP1 + fractions and MHV genomes ( Figures 1 K and 1L).
We next investigated whether any host proteins co-trafficked with MHV during egress. The KDEL receptor, an ER/Golgi apparatus-cycling transmembrane protein critical for retrieving escaped ER-resident proteins from the Golgi apparatus ( Munro and Pelham, 1987 52. Munro, S. ∙ Pelham, H.R. A C-terminal signal prevents secretion of luminal ER proteins Cell. 1987; 48 :899-907 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1833) PubMed Google Scholar ) and its cargo, the KDEL sequence containing the ER lumenal chaperones GRP78/BIP ( Figures 3 A–3C) and calreticulin (data not shown), were found to colocalize with LAMP1 and MHV during peak virus egress. Soluble ER chaperones generally do not escape the ER/Golgi apparatus and get secreted ( Munro and Pelham, 1987 52. Munro, S. ∙ Pelham, H.R. A C-terminal signal prevents secretion of luminal ER proteins Cell. 1987; 48 :899-907 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1833) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, in MHV-infected cells, these chaperones were co-released with the virus, and this was not due to cell lysis because actin was undetectable in the extracellular medium ( Figure 3 D). Remarkably, chaperone release, much like MHV, was not inhibited by BFA when the drug was added during the peak virus egress period (8–14 h pi) ( Figure 3 E). Note that since the BFA molecular target GBF1 is required for the generation of coronavirus replication organelles, addition of BFA before 6 h pi suppressed replication ( Verheije et al., 2008 81. Verheije, M.H. ∙ Raaben, M. ∙ Mari, M. ... Mouse hepatitis coronavirus RNA replication depends on GBF1-mediated ARF1 activation PLoS Pathog. 2008; 4 :e1000088 Crossref Scopus (125) PubMed Google Scholar ) and GRP78/BIP, similar to uninfected cells, was not released. These data demonstrate that, during egress, MHV and ER chaperones are co-trafficked to lysosomal organelles and released from cells through a route bypassing the BFA-sensitive biosynthetic secretory pathway.
Lysosome exocytosis is a known BFA-insensitive pathway whereby lysosomes traffic to the cell periphery and fuse with the plasma membrane to release their lumenal contents ( Laulagnier et al., 2011 36. Laulagnier, K. ∙ Schieber, N.L. ∙ Maritzen, T. ... Role of AP1 and Gadkin in the traffic of secretory endo-lysosomes Mol. Biol. Cell. 2011; 22 :2068-2082 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). We conjectured that MHV may be exploiting this route for egress. In support of this, we found that plasma membrane LAMP1 levels were ~2.5-fold higher in infected cells ( Figures 4 A and 4B), implying significant fusion of lysosomes with the plasma membrane.
Cathepsin D (~30 kD) is a proteolytic enzyme that is synthesized as pro-cathepsin D (~50 kD) and is cleaved into the mature form by lysosomal proteases ( Samarel et al., 1989 64. Samarel, A.M. ∙ Ferguson, A.G. ∙ Decker, R.S. ... Effects of cysteine protease inhibitors on rabbit cathepsin D maturation Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257 :C1069-C1079 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Collection of extracellular media from MHV-infected cells at peak egress revealed ~2-fold more cathepsin D and ~3-fold more pro-cathepsin D secreted relative to uninfected cells ( Figures 4 C–4E).
Cell surface total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) imaging of transiently expressed pHluorin-LAMP1-mCherry ( Raiborg et al., 2015 59. Raiborg, C. ∙ Wenzel, E.M. ∙ Pedersen, N.M. ... Repeated ER-endosome contacts promote endosome translocation and neurite outgrowth Nature. 2015; 520 :234-238 Crossref Scopus (317) PubMed Google Scholar ) also showed ~3-fold more lysosome fusion events in MHV-infected than in uninfected cells ( Figure 4 F). Immuno-EM of infected cells showed LAMP1 + /MHV + organelles just beneath ( Figure 4 G, pink arrows) and LAMP1 on ( Figure 4 G, white arrows) the plasma membrane.
Arl8b is a small Arf-like Ras family GTPase that localizes to late endosomes/lysosomes ( Boda et al., 2019 4. Boda, A. ∙ Lőrincz, P. ∙ Takáts, S. ... Drosophila Arl8 is a general positive regulator of lysosomal fusion events Biochim. Biophys. Acta Mol. Cell Res. 2019; 4 :533-544 Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar ; Khatter et al., 2015 33.

A phenotypic compound screening assay for lysosomal storage diseases J. Biomol.

Michelet, X. ∙ Garg, S. ∙ Wolf, B.J. ... MHC class II presentation is controlled by the lysosomal small GTPase, Arl8b J. Immunol. 2015; 194 :2079-2088 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cells transiently transfected with Arl8b-GFP and infected and coimmunostained with anti-GFP, anti-MHV (M J1.3 ), and anti-LAMP1 antibodies revealed numerous Arl8b + /MHV + /LAMP + organelles at peak egress stages ( Figure 4 H, arrows).
To interrogate the potential role of Arl8b in MHV release, we treated cells with non-targeting or targeting Arl8b small interfering RNAs (siRNA) for 48–72 h, infecting the cells with MHV, and collecting extracellular supernatant and cell lysates at peak egress times (12–14 h pi). Cell lysate measurements of protein levels demonstrated an ~50% downregulation of Arl8b in siRNA-treated cells ( Figures S4 A and S4B). qPCR measurements of genomic MHV RNA demonstrated that Arl8b-depleted cells had decreased viral genome release by ~30-fold compared with non-target siRNA-treated cells, whereas RNA replication was unaffected ( Figure 4 I). Moreover, Arl8b depletion also resulted in a more than 50% decrease in extracellular GRP78/BIP levels ( Figure 4 J), confirming that MHV and GRP78/BIP utilize Arl8b-dependent lysosomal exocytic pathways for egress during infection.
We then wanted to find out whether, in addition to lysosomes, direct fusion of late endosomes or multivesicular bodies (MVBs) with the plasma membrane contributed to MHV egress. Neither Rab27 GTPase depletion nor GW4869 treatment, both implicated in blocking this fusion pathway ( Catalano and O’Driscoll, 2019 9. Catalano, M. ∙ O’Driscoll, L. Inhibiting extracellular vesicles formation and release: a review of EV inhibitors J. Extracell. Vesicles. 2019; 9 :1703244 Crossref Scopus (376) PubMed Google Scholar ) had any significant effect on MHV egress ( Figures S4 C–S4E). However, late endosomes/MVBs are intermediates in the biogenesis of lysosomes ( Huotari and Helenius, 2011 31. Huotari, J. ∙ Helenius, A. Endosome maturation EMBO J. 2011; 30 :3481-3500 Crossref Scopus (1794) PubMed Google Scholar ) and, thus, may have a role in viral trafficking to lysosomes.
Rab7 is a small GTPase found on lysosomes, late endosomes, and MVBs ( Figure 5 A). It has a critical role in lysosome biogenesis and lysosome maintenance ( Bucci et al., 2000 7. Bucci, C. ∙ Thomsen, P. ∙ Nicoziani, P. ... Rab7: a key to lysosome biogenesis Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11 :467-480 Crossref Scopus (851) PubMed Google Scholar ; Langemeyer et al., 2018 35. Langemeyer, L. ∙ Fröhlich, F. ∙ Ungermann, C. Rab GTPase Function in Endosome and Lysosome Biogenesis Trends Cell Biol. 2018; 28 :957-970 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (263) PubMed Google Scholar ); depletion of Rab7 inhibits maturation of late endosomes/MVBs and leads to reduced lysosome numbers in cells ( Vanlandingham and Ceresa, 2009 79. Vanlandingham, P.A. ∙ Ceresa, B.P. Rab7 regulates late endocytic trafficking downstream of multivesicular body biogenesis and cargo sequestration J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284 :12110-12124 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (317) PubMed Google Scholar ). Dual immuno-EM performed on Rab7-GFP-transfected/MHV-infected cells with anti-GFP and anti-MHV(M J1.3 ) revealed MHV-loaded and empty lysosomes with characteristic electron-dense bodies, membrane swirls, and limiting membranes studded with Rab7-GFP ( Figure 5 A).
To investigate the effect of perturbing Rab7 activity on β-coronavirus egress, we treated MHV-infected cells from 8–14 h pi with the Rab7-selective competitive nucleotide binding inhibitor CID1067700 ( Agola et al., 2012 1. Agola, J.O. ∙ Hong, L. ∙ Surviladze, Z. ... A competitive nucleotide binding inhibitor: in vitro characterization of Rab7 GTPase inhibition ACS Chem. Biol. 2012; 7 :1095-1108 Crossref Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar ). After CID1067700 treatment, we measured an ~40% decrease in intracellular LAMP1 protein levels by western blot ( Figure 5 B) relative to DMSO-treated MHV-infected cells. Furthermore, we observed an ~50% decrease in LAMP1 + punctate organelles (per cell), suggesting a decrease in lysosome numbers ( Figures 5 C and 5D). These phenotypes are consistent with previous reports of Rab7 depletion ( Vanlandingham and Ceresa, 2009 79. Vanlandingham, P.A. ∙ Ceresa, B.P. Rab7 regulates late endocytic trafficking downstream of multivesicular body biogenesis and cargo sequestration J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284 :12110-12124 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (317) PubMed Google Scholar ), but the full lysosome proteome will need to be characterized to determine how CID1067700 affects lysosomes.
Most significantly, although CID1067700 had no effect on cell viability or replication ( Figure 5 E, intracellular), this compound potently decreased viral egress in a dose-dependent manner: by 100-fold at 4 μM and by 1,000-fold at 40 μM ( Figure 5 E, extracellular). These data further support a critical role of lysosomal biogenesis and exocytic pathways in regulating egress of β-coronaviruses and potentially identify a new class of potent therapeutic agents to impede their spread.
We then assessed the functional consequences of the path of egress taken by β-coronaviruses in terms of lysosomal function. We used LysoTracker Red DND-99, a cell-permeable weak base dye that is acidotropic and accumulates in acidified organelles ( Sanman et al., 2016 65. Sanman, L.E. ∙ van der Linden, W.A. ∙ Verdoes, M. ... Bifunctional Probes of Cathepsin Protease Activity and pH Reveal Alterations in Endolysosomal pH during Bacterial Infection Cell Chem. Biol. 2016; 23 :793-804 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, labeling cells with the dye prior to fixing with aldehydes and staining with anti-LAMP1 antibodies (without detergents) revealed near-complete localization of the dye fluorescence to LAMP1 + organelles; i.e., lysosomes and late endosomes ( Figure 6 A).
HeLa-mCC1a cells and primary mouse macrophages infected with MHV for 12 h and Vero E6 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 for up to 24 h were labeled with LysoTracker Red before imaging. We observed a stark decrease in LysoTracker Red fluorescence intensity per punctum and in the number of LysoTracker Red + puncta, indicating that the acidity and number of acidified lysosomes in β-coronavirus-infected cells were decreased compared with uninfected cells ( Figures 6 B–6D). Separate LAMP1 staining confirmed that the decrease in LysoTracker Red + puncta in β-coronavirus-infected cells was not due to a decrease in late endosome/lysosome quantities ( Figures 1 H and 1J).
LysoSensor Green DND-189 is a useful dye for quantifying pH in lysosomes because it accumulates in acidified organelles; it has a low pK of 5.2, which renders it non-fluorescent except in highly acidic organelles such as lysosomes, and its fluorescence amplitude changes with pH in a calibratable manner ( Brazill et al., 2000 5. Brazill, D.T. ∙ Caprette, D.R. ∙ Myler, H.A. ... A protein containing a serine-rich domain with vesicle fusing properties mediates cell cycle-dependent cytosolic pH regulation J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275 :19231-19240 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ). Using LysoSensor Green, we found that the mean pH of lysosomes in uninfected cells was pH 4.7 (with a range of 4.2–5.2), and in MHV-infected cells it was 5.7 (with a range of 5.0–6.4), very significant deacidification, one full pH unit higher than under uninfected conditions ( Figures 6 E).
Lysosomal enzymes are optimized to function in these organelles’ highly acidic pH, and even small increases in pH can be sufficient to decrease protease activity ( Lie and Nixon, 2019 38. Lie, P.P.Y. ∙ Nixon, R.A. Lysosome trafficking and signaling in health and neurodegenerative diseases Neurobiol. Dis. 2019; 122 :94-105 Crossref Scopus (185) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sanman et al., 2016 65. Sanman, L.E. ∙ van der Linden, W.A. ∙ Verdoes, M. ... Bifunctional Probes of Cathepsin Protease Activity and pH Reveal Alterations in Endolysosomal pH during Bacterial Infection Cell Chem. Biol. 2016; 23 :793-804 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ). Given our observations above, we quantified the in situ lysosomal enzyme activities using self-quenched enzymatic substrates that are taken up by endocytosis and targeted to lysosomes and turn fluorescent upon enzymatic activity ( Humphries and Payne, 2012 30. Humphries, 4th, W.H. ∙ Payne, C.K. Imaging lysosomal enzyme activity in live cells using self-quenched substrates Anal. Biochem. 2012; 424 :178-183 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ). To account for any potential change in endocytic uptake, we co-incubated cells with a pH-insensitive fluorophore-coupled dextran that was endocytosed along with substrate into lysosomes. The mean fluorescence intensity of the substrate was quantified in lysosomes of uninfected and MHV-infected cells with a similar mean dextran fluorescence intensity. These measurements revealed that, consistent with the observed increased lysosomal pH in MHV-infected cells, lysosome enzyme activities were reduced by ~40% relative to uninfected cells ( Figure 6 F). Furthermore, the increased secretion of pro-cathepsin D from MHV-infected cells ( Figure 4 E) likely reflects this decreased lysosomal enzymatic activity.
In that context, it has also been reported that the SARS-CoV-1 open reading frame protein 3A (ORF3a) is a viroporin that localizes to lysosomes, disrupts their acidification ( Yue et al., 2018 86. Yue, Y. ∙ Nabar, N.R. ∙ Shi, C.S. ... SARS-Coronavirus Open Reading Frame-3a drives multimodal necrotic cell death Cell Death Dis. 2018; 9 :904 Crossref Scopus (185) PubMed Google Scholar ), and contributes to viral egress ( Castaño-Rodriguez et al., 2018 8. Castaño-Rodriguez, C. ∙ Honrubia, J.M. ∙ Gutiérrez-Álvarez, J. ... Role of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Viroporins E, 3a, and 8a in Replication and Pathogenesis mBio. 2018; 9 :e02325-17 Crossref Scopus (219) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lu et al., 2006 41. Lu, W. ∙ Zheng, B.J. ∙ Xu, K. ... Severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus 3a protein forms an ion channel and modulates virus release Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103 :12540-12545 Crossref Scopus (239) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yue et al., 2018 86. Yue, Y. ∙ Nabar, N.R. ∙ Shi, C.S. ... SARS-Coronavirus Open Reading Frame-3a drives multimodal necrotic cell death Cell Death Dis. 2018; 9 :904 Crossref Scopus (185) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a ( Gordon et al., 2020 26. Gordon, D.E. ∙ Jang, G.M. ∙ Bouhaddou, M. ... A SARS-CoV-2 protein interaction map reveals targets for drug repurposing Nature. 2020; 583 :459-468 Crossref Scopus (3035) PubMed Google Scholar ) was also targeted to lysosomes ( Figure S5 A) and limited LysoTracker Red accumulation within them ( Figure S5 B). Although further investigation will be needed, these data suggest that ORF3a may be responsible for deacidifying lysosomes so that SARS-CoV-2 can use them for egress.
Finally, we investigated the functional consequences of the altered lysosomal functions during β-coronavirus infection in terms of antigen processing. Myeloid cells rely on active lysosomal degradation of proteins to produce short peptides that are loaded and presented on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I of cells ( Trombetta and Mellman, 2005 78. Trombetta, E.S. ∙ Mellman, I. Cell biology of antigen processing in vitro and in vivo Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 23 :975-1028 Crossref Scopus (931) PubMed Google Scholar ). We tested whether the decrease in protein degradation by cells infected with MHV would limit antigen cross-presentation of antigens derived from large proteins while minimally affecting presentation of short peptides. We exposed bone marrow-derived primary macrophages to extracellular chicken ovalbumin (OVA 1–385 protein) or to an OVA-derived MHC class I-restricted oligopeptide (OVA 257–264 peptide) with or without MHV infection ( Figures 7 A and 7B). First we measured endocytosis of fluorescent OVA 1–385 protein by macrophages and found that it was not significantly affected by MHV infection ( Figure 7 C). Then we measured the amount of OVA antigen being presented by macrophages using the H-2Kb/ OVA 257–264 -responsive OT-1 T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic T cells ( Figure 7 D). We found that coronavirus infection made macrophages induce stronger T cell activation when presenting OVA 257–264 peptide, but weaker T cell activation was measured when cross-presenting OVA 1–385 protein ( Figure 7 D). Such results point out how disrupted lysosomal function in infected cells alters antigen cross-presentation from proteins while possibly boosting presentation from peptides (e.g., by enhancing open conformers of MHC on the surface of cells through increased delivery by lysosome exocytosis).
We further tested whether coronavirus infection induces presentation of open conformers of MHC in human cells. Specifically, open conformers of human leukocyte antigen F (HLA-F) could stem from lysosomal dysfunction, serve as activating ligands for natural killer (NK) cells, and determine innate immune responses ( Garcia-Beltran et al., 2016 24. Garcia-Beltran, W.F. ∙ Hölzemer, A. ∙ Martrus, G. ... Open conformers of HLA-F are high-affinity ligands of the activating NK-cell receptor KIR3DS1 Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17 :1067-1074 Crossref Scopus (173) PubMed Google Scholar ; Goodridge et al., 2013 25. Goodridge, J.P. ∙ Lee, N. ∙ Burian, A. ... HLA-F and MHC-I open conformers cooperate in a MHC-I antigen cross-presentation pathway J. Immunol. 2013; 191 :1567-1577 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ). We infected HeLa-mCC1a cells with MHV. At 12 h pi, we added KIR3DL1- immunoreceptor tyrosine based activation motif (ITAM) Jurkat reporter cells ( Garcia-Beltran et al., 2016 24. Garcia-Beltran, W.F. ∙ Hölzemer, A. ∙ Martrus, G. ... Open conformers of HLA-F are high-affinity ligands of the activating NK-cell receptor KIR3DS1 Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17 :1067-1074 Crossref Scopus (173) PubMed Google Scholar ) and measured their ERK phosphorylation after 15 min by flow cytometry ( Figures 7 E and 7F). In parallel, we used acid stripping to open up MHC conformers. We found that MHV-infected cells triggered open HLA-F-responding Jurkat cells more efficiently, whereas acid stripping of cells induced a similar (enhanced) response with or without infection ( Figure 7 G). This demonstrated that β-coronavirus infection results in enhanced levels of open conformers of HLA-F, another functional immunologically relevant consequence of altered lysosomal activity and cellular stress.

Section: Discussion

Since the 1970s, intact coronaviruses have been detected in lysosomes at late stages of infection ( Ducatelle and Hoorens, 1984 19. Ducatelle, R. ∙ Hoorens, J. Significance of lysosomes in the morphogenesis of coronaviruses Arch. Virol. 1984; 79 :1-12 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ), but the significance of these observations remained unexplored. Here we demonstrated that β-coronaviruses egress from infected cells by tracking a path through lysosomal organelles. This is unlike other enveloped RNA viruses, whose egress tracks with the biosynthetic secretory pathway or directly buds out of the plasma membrane ( Robinson et al., 2018 61. Robinson, M. ∙ Schor, S. ∙ Barouch-Bentov, R. ... Viral journeys on the intracellular highways Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2018; 75 :3693-3714 Crossref Scopus (66) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ravindran et al., 2016 60. Ravindran, M.S. ∙ Bagchi, P. ∙ Cunningham, C.N. ...

Consistent with previous reports ( Machamer, 2013 43. Machamer, C.E. Accommodation of large cargo within Golgi cisternae Histochem. Cell Biol. 2013; 140 :261-269 Crossref Scopus (12) PubMed Google Scholar ; McBride et al., 2007 47. McBride, C.E. ∙ Li, J. ∙ Machamer, C.E.

Sorting of progeny coronavirus from condensed secretory proteins at the exit from the trans-Golgi network of AtT20 cells J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105 :1215-1226 Crossref Scopus (125) PubMed Google Scholar ), our experiments show that the secretory pathway remains largely operational in β-coronavirus-infected cells, with newly assembled virus particles budding into the lumen of the ER/ERGIC and trafficking to the Golgi apparatus/TGN during the early stages of infection. However, after reaching the Golgi apparatus/TGN, β-coronaviruses traffic to lysosomes and use exocytic lysosomes instead of the biosynthetic secretory pathway to egress ( Figures 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 ), as demonstrated by our experiments.
Work is in progress to delineate the route β-coronaviruses take to reach lysosomes, but least two BFA-insensitive (i.e., non-biosynthetic secretory) trafficking routes are possible ( Strous et al., 1993 72. Strous, G.J. ∙ van Kerkhof, P. ∙ van Meer, G. ... Differential effects of brefeldin A on transport of secretory and lysosomal proteins J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268 :2341-2347 Abstract Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). First is a direct route from the Golgi apparatus/TGN to lysosomes via late endosomes/MVBs. These organelles are known to mature into lysosomes through a Rab7 GTPase-regulated pathway ( Stroupe, 2018 71. Stroupe, C. This Is the End: Regulation of Rab7 Nucleotide Binding in Endolysosomal Trafficking and Autophagy Front. Cell Dev. Biol. 2018; 6 :129 Crossref Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, when we treated cells with CID1067700, a competitive inhibitor of Rab7 activation, lysosome numbers appeared to be reduced, and β-coronavirus egress was inhibited by ~3 logs. CID1067700 has been used in vivo with little toxicity ( Lam et al., 2016 34. Lam, T. ∙ Kulp, D.V. ∙ Wang, R. ... Small Molecule Inhibition of Rab7 Impairs B Cell Class Switching and Plasma Cell Survival To Dampen the Autoantibody Response in Murine Lupus J. Immunol. 2016; 197 :3792-3805 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ). Given this, it will be important to test whether CID1067700 can be an inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 spread in mice and non-human primate models. A second, more circuitous route to lysosomes would involve retrograde transport back to the ER/ERGIC. From there, viruses would reach lysosomes, again through late endosome/MVB intermediates or through the little-understood process of microphagy, where lysosomes directly engulf the ER ( Chino and Mizushima, 2020 12. Chino, H. ∙ Mizushima, N. ER-Phagy: Quality Control and Turnover of Endoplasmic Reticulum Trends Cell Biol. 2020; 30 :384-398 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (164) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We report here that the KDEL receptor and its cargo, the KDEL sequence-containing ER chaperones GRP78/BIP and calreticulin (data not shown) were selectively co-trafficked with coronaviruses to lysosomes and co-released with them outside of the cell ( Figure 3 ). In contrast, other secretory pathway resident proteins, such as mannosidase II, TGN46, Golgin 97, ERGIC53, and CI-MPR, remained behind and did not co-traffic to lysosomes ( Figures S2 and S3 ). In the ER, GRP78/BIP, in its role as a chaperone, likely binds and helps fold newly synthesized coronavirus proteins. Surprisingly, our findings indicate that this interaction is maintained while coronaviruses egress through exocytic lysosomes. Notably, during entry, GRP78/BIP interaction with SARS/MERS has been reported to facilitate the infectivity of these viruses ( Chu et al., 2018 13. Chu, H. ∙ Chan, C.M. ∙ Zhang, X. ... Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and bat coronavirus HKU9 both can utilize GRP78 for attachment onto host cells J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293 :11709-11726 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (132) PubMed Google Scholar ), and the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 has been postulated to directly bind GRP78/BIP ( Ha et al., 2020 29. Ha, D.P. ∙ Van Krieken, R. ∙ Carlos, A.J. ... The stress-inducible molecular chaperone GRP78 as potential therapeutic target for coronavirus infection J. Infect. 2020; 81 :452-482 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, one benefit of maintaining this interaction through exocytic lysosomes may be that coronaviruses are ready to infect a nearby cell as soon as they egress and are not limited by extracellular GRP78/BIP availability.
Lysosome exocytosis can be regulated by calcium ( Rodríguez et al., 1997 62. Rodríguez, A. ∙ Webster, P. ∙ Ortego, J. ... Lysosomes behave as Ca2+-regulated exocytic vesicles in fibroblasts and epithelial cells J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137 :93-104 Crossref Scopus (427) PubMed Google Scholar ). When intracellular calcium stores were chelated with BAPTA-AM, we measured an ~2-log decrease in MHV egress, but replication was also decreased ( Figure S4 F). On the other hand, depleting synaptotagmin VII, considered a calcium-dependent trigger for lysosomal fusion with the plasma membrane ( Martinez et al., 2000 46. Martinez, I. ∙ Chakrabarti, S. ∙ Hellevik, T. ... Synaptotagmin VII regulates Ca(2+)-dependent exocytosis of lysosomes in fibroblasts J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148 :1141-1149 Crossref Scopus (261) PubMed Google Scholar ), resulted in decreased viral egress without significantly affecting replication ( Figures S4 G and S4H). The context of β-coronavirus egress and the precise roles of calcium, synaptotagmins, and others remain to be investigated further.
Lysosomal proteolytic enzyme activities are central in many critical cellular processes, including autophagy, cell motility, cholesterol metabolism, release of cell killing enzymes by T cells, pathogen degradation by macrophages, and self/non-self antigen presentation by all cells. Lysosome acidification is required for lysosomal enzyme stability and enzymatic activity, and even a small increase in pH is sufficient to inhibit these enzymes and stop their critical biological functions ( Mindell 2012 51. Mindell, J.A. Lysosomal acidification mechanisms Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2012; 74 :69-86 Crossref Scopus (885) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here we report significant deacidification of lysosomes in β-coronavirus-infected cells in conjunction with a reduction in lysosomal enzyme activity ( Figures 6 B–6F). Moreover, infected cells were found to secrete greater amounts of lysosomal enzymes to the extracellular environment than uninfected cells. The mechanism of deacidification is currently under investigation. One possibility is that lysosomes become deacidified indirectly because of being loaded with too much cargo (i.e., viruses) and/or perturbations in proton pump or ion channel trafficking ( Ballabio and Bonifacino, 2020 3. Ballabio, A. ∙ Bonifacino, J.S. Lysosomes as dynamic regulators of cell and organismal homeostasis Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2020; 21 :101-118 Crossref Scopus (757) PubMed Google Scholar ). Alternatively, deacidification may be a consequence of the action of specific coronavirus proteins that behave like viroporins. For example, the γ-coronavirus E protein increases Golgi apparatus/TGN pH levels from 6.8 to 7.1 ( Ruch and Machamer, 2012 63. Ruch, T.R. ∙ Machamer, C.E. The coronavirus E protein: assembly and beyond Viruses. 2012; 4 :363-382 Crossref Scopus (211) PubMed Google Scholar ; Westerbeck and Machamer, 2019 83. Westerbeck, J.W. ∙ Machamer, C.E. The Infectious Bronchitis Coronavirus Envelope Protein Alters Golgi pH To Protect the Spike Protein and Promote the Release of Infectious Virus J. Virol. 2019; 93 :e00015-e00019 Crossref Scopus (59) PubMed Google Scholar ). SARS-CoV-1/CoV-2 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) express ORF3a, which has been shown previously ( Yue et al., 2018 86. Yue, Y. ∙ Nabar, N.R. ∙ Shi, C.S. ... SARS-Coronavirus Open Reading Frame-3a drives multimodal necrotic cell death Cell Death Dis. 2018; 9 :904 Crossref Scopus (185) PubMed Google Scholar ) and here ( Figures S5 A and S5B) to traffic to lysosomes and disrupt their acidification. Importantly, SARS/MERS viruses deficient in ORF3a may be unable to egress ( Castaño-Rodriguez et al., 2018 8. Castaño-Rodriguez, C. ∙ Honrubia, J.M. ∙ Gutiérrez-Álvarez, J. ...

Lu, W. ∙ Zheng, B.J. ∙ Xu, K. ... Severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus 3a protein forms an ion channel and modulates virus release Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

SARS-Coronavirus Open Reading Frame-3a drives multimodal necrotic cell death Cell Death Dis. 2018; 9 :904 Crossref Scopus (185) PubMed Google Scholar ), a phenotype that is consistent with acidic lysosomes being prohibitive to trafficking viral cargo.
Our findings here indicate that the altered lysosomal function of β-coronavirus-infected cells can result in perturbation of antigen presentation and lead to altered immune responses ( Figure 7 ). The flurry of studies triggered by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has pointed out how unusual and problematic immune responses against coronaviruses can be ( Vardhana and Wolchok, 2020 80. Vardhana, S.A. ∙ Wolchok, J.D. The many faces of the anti-COVID immune response J. Exp. Med. 2020; 217 :e20200678 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, clinicians as well as basic immunologists have difficulties reconciling observations (e.g., the delayed and erratic macrophage-driven cytokine release syndrome and the severe lymphopenia of CD4+ T and NK lymphocytes) with our current knowledge of immune responses against viruses or cancers ( Vardhana and Wolchok, 2020 80. Vardhana, S.A. ∙ Wolchok, J.D. The many faces of the anti-COVID immune response J. Exp. Med. 2020; 217 :e20200678 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Our findings regarding the cellular biology of coronaviruses and their functional consequence in terms of altered antigen presentation may open new research avenues; e.g., focusing on the NK cell response against coronavirus-infected cells. The relevance of KIR3DS1-expressing NK cells in delaying progression to AIDS in HIV-1-infected patients ( Martin et al., 2002 45. Martin, M.P. ∙ Gao, X. ∙ Lee, J.H. ... Epistatic interaction between KIR3DS1 and HLA-B delays the progression to AIDS Nat. Genet. 2002; 31 :429-434 Crossref Scopus (1005) PubMed Google Scholar ) or exacerbating the severity of H1N1 infections ( Aranda-Romo et al., 2012 2. Aranda-Romo, S. ∙ Garcia-Sepulveda, C.A. ∙ Comas-García, A. ... Killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) in severe A (H1N1) 2009 influenza infections Immunogenetics. 2012; 64 :653-662 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ) points out how our findings of increased presentation of open conformers of HLA-F (a known ligand for activating KIR3DS1 and inhibiting KIR3DL1 receptors) could have positive and negative effects on immune responses against coronavirus infection ( Garcia-Beltran et al., 2016 24. Garcia-Beltran, W.F. ∙ Hölzemer, A. ∙ Martrus, G. ... Open conformers of HLA-F are high-affinity ligands of the activating NK-cell receptor KIR3DS1 Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17 :1067-1074 Crossref Scopus (173) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, egress through lysosomal trafficking may also result in disruption of endolysosomal Toll-like receptor signaling, which requires acidification ( de Bouteiller et al., 2005 16. de Bouteiller, O. ∙ Merck, E. ∙ Hasan, U.A. ... Recognition of double-stranded RNA by human toll-like receptor 3 and downstream receptor signaling requires multimerization and an acidic pH J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280 :38133-38145 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (221) PubMed Google Scholar ). A non-enveloped virus has been shown recently to also use lysosomes for its egress ( Fernández de Castro et al., 2020 21. Fernández de Castro, I. ∙ Tenorio, R. ∙ Ortega-González, P. ... A modified lysosomal organelle mediates nonlytic egress of reovirus J. Cell Biol. 2020; 219 :e201910131 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Given our findings of the functional consequences of harnessing lysosomes on host cell physiology, including antigen presentation and innate immunity, it is likely that more and more cases of viruses exploiting these organelles for egress will come to light.
In summary, our findings reveal that β-coronaviruses use an unexpected lysosome-based egress pathway, and this potentially opens up new therapeutic avenues to mitigate coronavirus infection and slow virus spread by targeting regulators of lysosomal trafficking and biogenesis, such as Arl8b and Rab7, and by reversing deacidification and/or enhancing immune responses against lysosomal defects.

HeLa-mCC1a cells were cultured in complete (with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS)) or serum-free Dulbecco’s Minimal Essential Medium (DMEM)/high glucose/Penicillin-/Streptomycin (Pen/Strep) and maintained at 37°C. Vero E6 cells were cultured in Eagle’s Minimal Essential Medium (EMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS and Pen/Strep and maintained at 37°C.
Primary mouse macrophages were prepared starting from bone marrow precursors harvested from 6-12-week old female C57Bl16 mice (Jackson Labs, Bar Harbor, ME). Femoral aspirates were collected, washed with complete RPMI once, resuspended at 1 million per ml in complete RPMI medium augmented with 1nM recombinant mouse M-CSF (R&D Systems, Minneapolis MN). The single cell suspension was then placed in Fluoroethyl polymer culture bags (Origen Biomedical, Austin TX) to expand and to differentiate. Medium was replaced with complete RPMI augmented with 1nM M-CSF after 3 days of culture. Macrophages were harvested after 7 days of culture, washed in complete RPMI, seeded in 96-flat well plates (10,000 cells per well, with 100μl complete RPMI) and left to adhere overnight for additional experiment.
Complete RPMI consists of RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat–inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L–glutamine, 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.1 mM non–essential amino acids, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 μg/ml of penicillin, 100 μg/ml of streptomycin and 50 μM β–mercaptoethanol.
HeLa-mCC1a cells were infected with MHV-A59 for 4hrs, washed, and then kept in either complete (with 10%FBS) or serum-free DMEM/high glucose/Pen/Strep for desired period of time. Vero E6 cells were grown in Millicell EZ 8-well glass slides (Millipore) in infection media (EMEM, 4% FBS (Corning)) to a confluency of 90 – 100%. Cells were then infected with the SARS-CoV2 isolate USA-WA1/2020 at a MOI 1 for 24hrs.
Extracellular medium collected from infected cell cultures was serially diluted and dilutions used to inoculate multiple cell cultures for up to 72hr. Cytopathic changes in the cells were tabulated to calculate TCID50/mL values, as described ( Leibowitz et al., 2011 37. Leibowitz, J. ∙ Kaufman, G. ∙ Liu, P. Coronaviruses: propagation, quantification, storage, and construction of recombinant mouse hepatitis virus Curr. Protoc. Microbiol. 2011; Chapter 15, Unit 15E.1 Crossref Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, supernatant (media) from MHV infected and BFA treated cells were obtained and inoculated to HeLa-mCC1a cells seeded at 4X10 4 cells/well in 96-well format. 11 serial dilution of the media was prepared in DMEM (10 −1 to 10 −11 ) and added in triplicates for statistical significance. Cells were left in 37°C incubator for 72hrs. Thereafter the media was discarded and each well received 100 μL of Crystal Violet solution (25% crystal violet supplemented with 20% ethanol in double distilled water) and incubated for 15min. The solution was discarded, each well was washed twice with water and the image of the 96-well plate was captured. Dilution that showed 50% cell death (i.e., where 50% of the cells in dish were left behind, stained with Crystal Violet) was used for calculating TCID50/ml.
All DNA transfections were carried out with Fugene 6 according to manufacturer instructions (Promega Corp.).Briefly, Fugene 6 was incubated with serum-free media for 5min and then mixed with plasmid DNA (Gaussia Luciferase, pHluorin-LAMP1-mCherry, Arl8b-GFP) in a separate tube and incubated for another 20min. The plasmid DNA / Fugene 6 mixture was pipetted slowly onto the culture of cells. Cells were kept at 37°C and utilized after 18-24hrs.
Brefeldin A (BFA) was prepared as a 5mg/ml stock solution in ethanol and Dyngo-4a was prepared as a 100mM stock in DMSO; both were stored long term at −20°C.
BAPTA-AM was prepared fresh (prior to experiment) as a 10mM stock solution in DMSO and not stored. BFA and Dyngo-4a treatments were done in cell culture media; For BAPTA-AM treatment, cells at 8hr pi were switched to calcium-free media supplemented with 2mM EGTA and 30 μM BAPTA-AM.
Unless otherwise indicated, cells were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde (PFA)/phosphate buffer solution (PBS) for 10 min; blocked in PBS/10%FBS. All primary and secondary antibody incubations were carried out in PBS/10%FBS supplemented with saponin at 0.2% for 1 hr at room temperature. Cells were rinsed in PBS and mounted with Fluoromount-G (Invitrogen).
For cell surface LAMP1 staining, cells were pre-chilled at 4°C for 20 min and incubated on ice with anti-LAMP1 (R & D) antibody in PBS for 30 min. After rinses with chilled PBS, cells were kept on ice and incubated with appropriate secondary antibody in PBS for 30min. Cells were rinsed with chilled PBS, fixed in chilled 2% PFA for 5min, rinsed and mounted.
All microscopy and image acquisition were performed on the LSM780 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss USA) with a 63X/1.4 NA or 40X/1.3 NA oil objectives. Live cells were imaged on a heated stage. Cells were imaged with 12-bit resolution using pinhole settings optimized for either high resolution imaging or for fluorescence quantification where the pinhole was kept open such that fluorescence from entire organelle or cell volume could be acquired. Zen software (Carl Zeiss USA) were used for all image analysis including quantification of LAMP1, CI-MPR, Lysotracker Red DND-99 etc. positive organelles.
pHluorin-LAMP1-mCherry (gift of Harald Stanmark, University of Oslo, Norway) transfected cells were plated on coverglass chambers (Nunc Lab-Tek II, ThermoFisher). Cells were left uninfected or infected with MHV. After 4 hr, cells were washed with phenol red free DMEM/10%FBS/25mMHEPES pH 7.3 and kept in this media. After 10hr of infection, cells were placed on the heated ELYRA.PS1 microscope stage. Fluorescent fusion events at the plasma membrane (facing the coverslip) were imaged using the ELYRA.PS1 in its TIRF setting mode (488nm laser excitation and 505-550BP filter emission to image the pHluorin; 565 excitation and 575LP to image the mCherry) with an incident angle providing an evanescent field < 100nm. Time series, with no delay in between frames, was collected for a total of 3min. Appearance of punctate pHluorin fluorescence above background were counted as fusion events, quantified and plotted.
HeLa-mCC1a cells were infected with MHV and fixed in 4% formaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde in 1x PHEM buffer for 90 min. Cryo-sectioning and immunolabelling were performed as described elsewhere ( Griffiths et al., 1993 28. Griffiths, G. ∙ Burke, B. ∙ Lucocq, J. Fine structure immunocytochemistry Springer, 1993 Crossref Google Scholar ; Tokuyasu, 1973 74. Tokuyasu, K.T. A technique for ultracryotomy of cell suspensions and tissues J. Cell Biol. 1973; 57 :551-565 Crossref Scopus (838) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, ultrathin sections (55–70 nm) from gelatin-embedded and frozen cell pellets were obtained using an FC7/UC7-ultramicrotome (Leica, Vienna, Austria). Immunogold labeling was carried out on thawed sections with anti-GFP (2.5 mg/ml, rabbit, Rockland, 600-401-215), J1.3 (1:50, mouse), anti-LAMP1 (1:20, rabbit) antibodies. Mouse primary antibodies were detected with polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin Gs (0.5 mg/ml, Rockland, 610-40120). All samples were incubated with 5 or 10 nm protein A gold (1:50, UMC Utrecht University, Utrecht, Netherlands), as described ( Griffiths et al., 1993 28. Griffiths, G. ∙ Burke, B. ∙ Lucocq, J. Fine structure immunocytochemistry Springer, 1993 Crossref Google Scholar ), and stained/embedded in 4% uranyl acetate / 2% methylcellulose mixture (ratio 1:9) ( Slot and Geuze, 2007 67. Slot, J.W. ∙ Geuze, H.J. Cryosectioning and immunolabeling Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2 :2480-2491 Crossref Scopus (361) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tokuyasu, 1980 75. Tokuyasu, K.T. Immunochemistry on ultrathin frozen sections Histochem. J. 1980; 12 :381-403 Crossref Scopus (633) PubMed Google Scholar ). Sections were examined with a JEM-1200EX (JEOL USA) transmission electron microscope (accelerating voltage 80 keV) equipped with a bottom-mounted AMT 6-megapixel digital camera (Advanced Microscopy Techniques Corp).

Rather than a Pearson correlation coefficient, we calculated colocalization coefficients as recommended in Manders et al. (1993) 44. Manders, E.M.M. ∙ Verbeek, F.J. ∙ Aten, J.A. Measurement of co localization of objects in duaå colour confocal images J. Microsc. 1993; 169 :375-382 Crossref Scopus (1678) PubMed Google Scholar and computed the weighted colocalization coefficients WCC for the LAMP1 (lysosome) and protein M (MHV particle) channels. Using the colocalization toolbox from the ZEN software, we defined four quadrants for high/low fluorescence in each channel. Then we compute 𝑊 ⁢ 𝐶 ⁢ 𝐶 = ∑ 𝑖 𝑓 𝑖 , 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑐 ∑ 𝑖 𝑓 𝑖 , 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑙 where:
𝑓 𝑖 , 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑐 is the fluorescence of pixel high in both LAMP-1 and protein M fluorescence
𝑓 𝑖 , 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑙 is the total fluorescence for the LAMP-1 channel.
WCC varies between 0 and 1, with 0 corresponding to none of the lysosome pixel colocalizing with the M protein, and 1 corresponding to a perfect overlap where each lysosome pixel has a high M protein fluorescence. Calculation of colocalization coefficients for LAMP1 and CI-MPR was carried out as described above.
Uninfected and MHV/SARS-Cov2-infected cells were incubated with Lysotracker Red DND-99 (100nM) or Lysosensor Green DND-189 (1 μM) according to manufacturer (ThermoFisher Scientific) instructions. For Lysosensor Green pH measurements, Step 1: cells were imaged with 458nm Argon laser excitation and 500-550nm bandpass emission filters. Step 2: the cells in step 1 were treated sequentially with potassium buffers of known pH containing 10 μM Nigericin. The images at each buffer condition were collected using the same image acquisition settings as in Step 1 to generate a standard pH curve. This standard curve was then used to convert the fluorescence values collected in step 1 to pH values.
Uninfected and MHV-infected cells were incubated with Alexa-555 10kD dextran (1mg/ml) and Lysosome-Specific Self-Quenched Substrate (Abcam Cat No. ab234622) at manufacturers recommended dosage for 1hr before they were fixed with 4% PFA at room temperature for 15 min. Cells were mounted with Fluoromount G (Invitrogen) containing DAPI and imaged with Zeiss LSM780 Confocal Laser Scanning microscope. Images were analyzed using Zen software. Mean fluorescence intensity of substrate was quantified in lysosomes with similar mean dextran fluorescence intensity in uninfected and MHV-infected cells.
After the incubation period cells were harvested from individual treatment groups and resuspended in 1ml of 1X PBS. A 1:1 mixture of cell suspension and 0.4% Trypan Blue stain (Invitrogen, Eugene, OR, Catalogue No. T10282) was made and incubated for 3 min at room temperature. 10μl of the mixture was added to Countess cell counting chamber slide (Invitrogen, Eugene, OR, Catalogue No. 100078809) and quantified cell viability in Countess Automated Cell Counter (Invitrogen, Eugene, OR, Catalogue No. C10227). In order to image the Trypan blue staining, cells were seeded in 4-well cover-glass bottom chamber slides and incubated overnight before being inoculated with virus. One group received 300nM of staurosporine, an apoptosis inducer, used as a positive control for comparing cell viability for uninfected and MHV-infected cells. At 14 hr pi media was replaced with 100μl of PBS and 0.4% Trypan Blue was added in a 1:1 ratio followed by incubation for ~3 min at room temperature. PBS was removed and cells were imaged by DIC.
After the incubation period cells were harvested from individual treatment groups and washed in 200μl of 1X PBS. 50μl of Trypsin Versene was then added to each well, and the plate was incubated for 10 min at 37°C. 150μl of FACS buffer was then added and cells were spun down and washed once in 200μl FACS buffer. Cells were then resuspended in 75μl of propidium iodide (PI) in FACS buffer (final concentration = 10μg/ml), incubated for 5min at room temperature and immediately run on a Fortessa Flow Cytometer: fluorescence of PI was acquired in the PE-CF594 channel, forward scattering (FSC) was also acquired. Live/Dead cells were then counted post-acquisition using FlowJo: Live cells were defined as FSC+PI- and dead cells were defined as FSC-PI+ (see Figure S1 B). Each time point was set up in quadruplicate.
Gaussia Luciferase Assay was performed using the Pierce Gaussia Luciferase Glow assay kit (Thermo Scientific, USA, Catalog No. 16160). Fugene 6 was used to transfect HeLa-mCC1a cells with Gaussia luciferase plasmid and after mock or MHV infection and with and without BFA treatment, supernatants were collected and analyzed for Gaussia Luciferase activity as dictated by manufacturer instructions. Briefly, 15μl of the media from the treated wells was added to a black opaque 96-well plate and to that added 50μl of the working solution. After a 10 min incubation detected the glow luminescence in a Synergy H1 Hybrid Multi-Mode Reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA).
Lysosome isolation was adapted from Graham et al. (1990) 27. Graham, J.M. ∙ Ford, T. ∙ Rickwood, D. Isolation of the major subcellular organelles from mouse liver using Nycodenz gradients without the use of an ultracentrifuge Anal. Biochem. 1990; 187 :318-323 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar . Cells were grown in 150cm 2 dishes and divided into 3 groups: uninfected, MHV and MHV + Dyngo-4a. Cells were infected with MHV; washed at 4 hr pi with 1X PBS. 30 μM of Dyngo- 4a was added to one group at 6 hr pi. Cells were harvested at 12 hr pi from all 3 groups. Medium was removed, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, scraped on ice, resuspended in 1mL of ice-cold TNE buffer (Tris NaCl EDTA buffer, Quality Biological, Gaithesburg, MD, Catalog No. 351-302-101; DNase, RNase, and Protease tested) and collected in a 2mL Eppendorf tube. After a quick freeze-thaw, cells were lysed on ice using a 28G syringe (15 strokes) and centrifuged 10 min at 800 g at 4°C to pellet nuclei and residual non-lysed cells. The supernatant was harvested and centrifuged 15 min at 20,000 g at 4°C. The obtained pellet was resuspended in 1mL TNE buffer and centrifuged once more 15 min at 20,000 g at 4°C. After a final resuspension in 1mL TNE buffer, it was loaded on top of a 25%–40% Nycodenz (Fisher Scientific, USA, Catalog No. AN1002423) discontinuous gradient and centrifuged for 2 hr at 100,000xg at 4°C using a SW40 Ti rotor (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN, Catalog No. 331301). Fractions were harvested from the top; aliquots of each fraction were set aside for western blot analysis with organelle markers; the rest was processed for qPCR analysis of genomic MHV RNA.
Western Blot was performed from both cell lysates and supernatants. For cell lysates protein was quantified by Pierce BCA Protein Assay kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, Catalogue No. 23225) while for supernatants protein was precipitated using Trichloroacetic Acid (Fisher Chemical, Fair Lawn, NJ, Catalogue No. A322-100) followed by acetone washes. Samples were boiled in Laemmli Sample Buffer (Bio Rad, USA, Catalogue No. 1610747) for 10min before running on pre-made SDS-PAGE gels (Bio Rad, USA). Gels were transferred on nitrocellulose membrane provided in the kit provide along with Trans-Blot Turbo 5X Buffer (Bio Rad, USA, Catalogue No. 10026938) and run in a Trans-Blot Turbo system as per the user manual. Following transfer blots were blocked using 5% non-fat milk blocking followed by probing with primary antibodies diluted in 5% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) and overnight incubation. Blots were thereafter washed with 1X TBS buffer (Bio-Rad, USA, Catalogue No. 1706435) supplemented with Tween-20 (Affymetrix, Maumee, OH, Catalogue No. 90005-04-5). Further re-probed with corresponding HRP conjugated secondary antibodies and incubated for 1hr followed by washing steps. Blots were developed using SuperSignal West Pico PLUS Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, Catalogue No. 34580) and imaged in Amersham Imager 600 (GE Healthcare Biosciences, Pistcataway, NJ). All densitometric quantification was done in Amersham Imager 600 software.
Serum free extracellular media from cells was collected and concentrated in a spin concentrator followed by TCA precipitation, acetone wash and air dry. Samples were resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer with β-ME, boiled for 5 min and ran on 4%–20% gradient acrylamide gels (Bio Rad, USA) before being transferred onto nitrocellulose for western blotting with antibodies against targets of interest (cathepsin D, BIP/GRP78, actin etc.).
Cell lysates and supernatants were obtained from specific time points of virus and mock infections and lysed using RNA lysis buffer provided in the RNA isolation kit (Quick-RNA Microprep Kit, Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, Catalog No. R1051). RNA isolation was performed as per the manufacturer’s instructions and cDNA was prepared using Thermo Scientific Maxima First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit for RT-qPCR (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, Catalog No. FERK1642). RT-PCR was performed using iTaq Universal SYBR® Green Supermix (BioRad, Hercules, CA, Catalog No. 1725124) in Roche LightCycler 96 system (Roche, Product No. 05815916001). The thermal cycling conditions were composed of a pre-incubation step of 95°C for 90 s followed by 40 cycles at 95°C for 10 sec, 54°C for 10 sec and 72°C for 110 sec. The samples were run in duplicate for each data point for an experiment. The primers used are mentioned below:

Arl8b, synaptotagmin VII and Non-Target siRNA (Horizon Therapeutics), with 25nM-50nM concentration range, were transfected with Dharmafect 1 (Horizon Therapeutics) and incubated for up to 72 hr pi. They were infected with MHV for 4 hr, before washing off the virus and switching to serum free media. At 12-14 hr pi, intracellular and extracellular virus was quantified by qPCR. For intracellular RNA levels, cells were lysed with RNA lysis buffer (Zymo Research); for intracellular protein level quantifications cells were scraped and lysed in cell lysis buffer (Invitrogen) containing protease inhibitors. For Rab27 depletion, siRNA was purchased from Ambion. In all siRNA treatments, both intracellular and extracellular proteins were TCA precipitated from serum-free media, acetone washed, air-dried and suspended in Laemmli gel loading buffer before SDS-PAGE/Western analysis.
Bone-marrow derived macrophages were prepared from femoral aspirates cultured for 7 days in complete RPMI medium with 1nM M-CSF in Fluoroethyl polymer culture bags (Origen). 2.104 cells were harvested and plated on plastic (96-flat-well plate), let to adhere for 2hrs, then exposed to MHV (or not) for 24 hr. Macrophages were then infected with SIINFEKL peptides or with chicken ovalbumin at varied concentrations for 2 hr, then washed with complete RPMI. C57Bl6 Rag1−/− OT-1 TCR Transgenic mouse splenocytes were then harvested, cleared of their red blood cells by ACK lysis, added and spun onto macrophages (105 cells per well), and incubated for 6 hr. Cell cultures were then harvested using a 15 min trypsin-versene treatment, washed and antibody-stained for flow cytometry (see panel below) with DAPI added just before acquisition. Cells were analyzed using a 5-laser FORTESSA flow cytometer (BD Bioscience) as well as single-stained compensatory UltraComp ebeads (Invitrogen). Data were compensated and processed using FlowJo (TreeStar) and a custom-written Python pipeline ( https://www.python.org ). The level of antigen presentation was quantified using the percentage of live activated T cells (itself estimated as % CD69+ among FSCintDAPI-Va2+ cells).

Chicken ovalbumin was fluorescently labeled with the Alexa647 dye using a bioconjugation kit (ThermoFisher). Bone-marrow derived macrophages were prepared as described in the previous paragraph. 2.104 cells were harvested, and plated on plastic (96-flat-well plate), let to adhere for 2 hr, then exposed to MHV (or not) for 24 hr. Macrophages were then infected with varying concentrations of fluorescently-labeled chicken ovalbumin for 2 hr, harvested with a 15 min exposure to a solution of trypsin-versene-EDTA mixture (Lonza), washed with FACS buffer (PBS/4%FBS/0.1%Sodium Azide) and immediately analyzed by flow cytometry.
HeLa-mCC1a cells were plated and infected (or not) with MHV for 24 hr. Cells were lifted up using a trypsin-versene solution, washed with PBS, incubated for 1min at room temperature with a 0.1 M solution of Glycine in PBS (pH adjusted to 2.4) for acid stripping, or with PBS for control, then washed with complete RPMI twice. KIR3DL1-reporter Jurkat cells ( Garcia-Beltran et al., 2016 24. Garcia-Beltran, W.F. ∙ Hölzemer, A. ∙ Martrus, G. ... Open conformers of HLA-F are high-affinity ligands of the activating NK-cell receptor KIR3DS1 Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17 :1067-1074 Crossref Scopus (173) PubMed Google Scholar ) were cultured in complete RPMI and harvested by aspiration. 5.104 HeLa-mCC1a cells were washed with Jurkat cell culture medium then resuspended with 5.104 Jurkat cells, spun at 100 g for 15 sec and incubated at 37°C for 15 min (some wells received only Jurkat cells or Jurkat cells and 1μMol of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate for negative and positive controls, respectively). Cells were then immediately resuspended with ice-cold 2% PFA for 115 min, permeabilized with ice-cold 90% Methanol for 15 min, washed with FACS buffer and stained for phospho-ERK (E10 clone, Cell Signaling Technology) and anti-mouse secondary antibody (Jackson Immunochemicals). A more detailed protocol can be found in Vogel et al., ( Vogel et al., 2016 82. Vogel, R.M. ∙ Erez, A. ∙ Altan-Bonnet, G. Dichotomy of cellular inhibition by small-molecule inhibitors revealed by single-cell analysis Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 :12428 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cells were analyzed using a 5-laser FORTESSA flow cytometer (BD Bioscience). Data were processed using FlowJo (TreeStar) and a custom-written Python pipeline ( python.org ). The levels of open HLA-F conformers were quantified by monitoring Jurkat cell activation (itself estimated geometric mean of phosphor-ERK staining in FSCint Jurkat cells).
All graphs were plotted and unpaired two-tailed Student-t Test was performed using the GraphPad Prism 8 software or the SciPy Statistics library in Python. p values were considered significant for p < 0.05 unless otherwise indicated and denoted as ∗ where p < 0.05; ∗∗ where p < 0.01; where ∗∗∗ p < 0.0002; ∗∗∗∗ where p < 0.00001; and ns = not significant.
