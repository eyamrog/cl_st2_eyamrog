Title: Thermus thermophilus Argonaute Functions in the Completion of DNA Replication


Abstract: Summary

In many eukaryotes, Argonaute proteins, guided by short RNA sequences, defend cells against transposons and viruses. In the eubacterium Thermus thermophilus , the DNA-guided Argonaute TtAgo defends against transformation by DNA plasmids. Here, we report that TtAgo also participates in DNA replication. In vivo , TtAgo binds 15- to 18-nt DNA guides derived from the chromosomal region where replication terminates and associates with proteins known to act in DNA replication. When gyrase, the sole T. thermophilus type II topoisomerase, is inhibited, TtAgo allows the bacterium to finish replicating its circular genome. In contrast, loss of gyrase and TtAgo activity slows growth and produces long sausage-like filaments in which the individual bacteria are linked by DNA. Finally, wild-type T. thermophilus outcompetes an otherwise isogenic strain lacking TtAgo. We propose that the primary role of TtAgo is to help T. thermophilus disentangle the catenated circular chromosomes generated by DNA replication.

Section: Introduction

In all domains of life, short nucleic acid guides direct Argonaute (AGO) proteins to defend against transposons, viruses, and plasmids. Eukaryotic AGO proteins use RNA guides to bind RNA targets, but the consequences of sequence-specific RNA binding differ among organisms and small RNA pathways ( Ghildiyal et al., 2010 21.

Some AGO proteins act as programmable endonucleases, cleaving their targets between nucleotides t10 and 11, by using a divalent cation to catalyze hydrolysis of the phosphodiester bond that lies across from guide nucleotides g10 and g11 ( Elbashir et al., 2001a 14.

For example, in the animal RNA interference pathway, small interfering RNAs direct AGO2 to bind and cleave extensively complementary target RNAs ( Hammond et al., 2000 25.

In contrast, most animal miRNAs bind target sites that are only partially complementary to their sequence and then assemble a multiprotein complex that includes deadenylase, decapping, and exonuclease enzymes that degrade the entire RNA ( Huntzinger and Izaurralde, 2011 33.

Some AGO proteins act in the nucleus to silence transcription, typically by binding nascent RNA and recruiting DNA- or chromatin-modifying enzymes that convert euchromatin to heterochromatin ( Aravin et al., 2008 2.

In contrast, eubacterial AGO proteins can use RNA or DNA guides to bind or cleave DNA. Eubacterial and archaeal AGOs have long served as structural and biochemical models for understanding eukaryotic AGO function. In contrast to our detailed biophysical understanding of how prokaryotic AGO (pAGO) proteins find, bind, and cleave their RNA and DNA targets, little is known about the biological functions of pAGOs. In vivo , Rhodobacter sphaeroides Ago, which lacks endonuclease activity, uses RNA guides and binds DNA targets ( Olovnikov et al., 2013 58. Olovnikov, I. ∙ Chan, K. ∙ Sachidanandam, R. ... Bacterial argonaute samples the transcriptome to identify foreign DNA Mol. Cell. 2013; 51 :594-605 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (172) PubMed Google Scholar ). The AGO proteins from Clostridium butyricum , Limnothrix rosea , Methanocaldococcus jannaschii , Pyrococcus furiosus , and Synechoccus elongatus use DNA guides to cleave DNA ( Hegge et al., 2019 29. Hegge, J.W. ∙ Swarts, D.C. ∙ Chandradoss, S.D. ...

MjAgo and CbAgo also display a sequence-independent nuclease activity that cleaves double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) ( Zander et al., 2017 88. Zander, A. ∙ Willkomm, S. ∙ Ofer, S. ...

Although ~17% of sequenced eubacterial genomes encode AGO proteins, few pAGO-expressing bacteria are tractable in the laboratory ( Ryazansky et al., 2018 67. Ryazansky, S. ∙ Kulbachinskiy, A. ∙ Aravin, A.A. The Expanded Universe of Prokaryotic Argonaute Proteins MBio. 2018; 9 :e01935-18 Crossref Scopus (84) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consequently, several pAGOs (RsAgo, NgAgo, CbAgo, and TtAgo) have been studied by expressing them in E. coli , a mesophile whose genome encodes no AGO protein ( Gao et al., 2016 20.

In vivo , TtAgo reduces the susceptibility of T. thermophilus to transformation by DNA plasmids and, when produced in E. coli , randomly acquires guide DNAs from plasmids and the E. coli genome ( Swarts et al., 2014 76. Swarts, D.C. ∙ Jore, M.M. ∙ Westra, E.R. ... DNA-guided DNA interference by a prokaryotic Argonaute Nature. 2014; 507 :258-261 Crossref Scopus (322) PubMed Google Scholar ). T. thermophilus encodes its genes on a large circular chromosome (~1.9 Mb) and one (HB27 strain) or two (HB8 strain) megaplasmids as large as 0.27 Mb ( Oshima and Imahori, 1974 59. Oshima, T. ∙ Imahori, K. Description of Thermus thermophilus (Yoshida and Oshima) cmb. nov. , a nonsporulating thermophilic bacterium from a Japanese thermal spa Int. J. Syst.

The genome sequence of the extreme thermophile Thermus thermophilus Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22 :547-553 Crossref Scopus (332) PubMed Google Scholar ). Each cell contains 4–7 copies of the chromosome and the megaplasmid, and both segregate randomly between daughter cells ( Li, 2019 45. Li, H. Random Chromosome Partitioning in the Polyploid Bacterium Thermus thermophilus HB27 G3 (Bethesda). 2019; 9 :1249-1261 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ohtani et al., 2010 56.

Here, we report that, in vivo , TtAgo also participates in DNA replication. TtAgo binds small DNA guides derived from the chromosomal region where replication terminates and associates with proteins known to act in DNA replication. T. thermophilus deploys a single type II topoisomerase, gyrase. When gyrase is inhibited, T. thermophilus relies on TtAgo to complete replication of its circular genome; loss of both gyrase and TtAgo activity inhibits growth and produces long filaments that fail to separate into individual bacteria. Finally, we find that TtAgo confers a growth advantage on T. thermophilus under non-selective conditions. We propose that the primary role of TtAgo is to help T. thermophilus disentangle the catenated circular chromosomes made by DNA replication.

Section: Results

Although pAGOs often reside in genomic neighborhoods populated by genes acting in host defense, TtAgo resides on the megaplasmid in a region encoding Cbi proteins that synthesize vitamin B12, stress-induced phosphatase, and the transcription factor CcpA; the nearest host defense proteins, Cas2 (TT_P0101) and Cas6 (TT_P0204), reside 104 kbp upstream and 55 kbp downstream of TtAgo, respectively ( Makarova et al., 2009 50. Makarova, K.S. ∙ Wolf, Y.I. ∙ van der Oost, J. ... Prokaryotic homologs of Argonaute proteins are predicted to function as key components of a novel system of defense against mobile genetic elements Biol. Direct. 2009; 4 :29 Crossref Scopus (204) PubMed Google Scholar ) (for our sequenced lab strain assembly). The toxin/antitoxin system YefM/PhD (TT_P0064) lies 57 kbp upstream of TtAgo. Thus, the genes near TtAgo provide little insight into its function.
To begin to understand the biological function of TtAgo in vivo , we generated a polyclonal antibody against TtAgo by using recombinant, full-length TtAgo as the immunogen, and we used an anti-TtAgo antibody to immunoprecipitate the nucleic acids associated with TtAgo in wild-type or mutant T. thermophilus HB27 strains grown at 65°C ( Figures 1 A–1C; Figures S1 A and S1B). Long (~1,160 bp by Bioanalyzer capillary electrophoresis) and short (15–18 nt) 5′ monophosphorylated nucleic acids co-immunoprecipitated with wild-type TtAgo ( Figures 1 D and 1E). Sensitivity to DNase and resistance to RNase identified the nucleic acids associated with TtAgo as DNA ( Figure 1 D). Notably, 15- to 18-nt-long DNAs have been shown previously to be the optimal length for sequence-specific RNA cleavage catalyzed by purified recombinant TtAgo at 70°C ( Wang et al., 2008a 81. Wang, Y. ∙ Juranek, S. ∙ Li, H. ... Structure of an argonaute silencing complex with a seed-containing guide DNA and target RNA duplex Nature. 2008; 456 :921-926 Crossref Scopus (462) PubMed Google Scholar ). High-throughput sequencing of the long DNAs showed that they mapped essentially to the entire chromosome and megaplasmid ( Figure S1 C). In contrast, the 15- to 18-nt-long small DNAs bound to TtAgo derived mainly from a 39-kb region on the T. thermophilus chromosome, 183° clockwise from the annotated origin of replication ( ori ) ( Figure 1 E).
The small DNAs mapping to the megaplasmid similarly derived from a region opposite the origin of replication ( Figure 1 E). Among the 15- to 18-nt sequences mapping just once to the genome (96% of reads), 90% aligned to the chromosome and 10% to the megaplasmid, a distribution comparable with the relative sizes of the two genomic components (88% and 12% of the genome, respectively), indicating that neither is preferentially sampled. As observed for TtAgo expressed in E. coli ( Swarts et al., 2014 76. Swarts, D.C. ∙ Jore, M.M. ∙ Westra, E.R. ... DNA-guided DNA interference by a prokaryotic Argonaute Nature. 2014; 507 :258-261 Crossref Scopus (322) PubMed Google Scholar ), the small DNAs co-immunoprecipitated with TtAgo in vivo typically began with cytidine but otherwise had a GC content identical to the T. thermophilus genome ( Figures S1 D).
That TtAgo binds small DNAs from a ~39-kbp region directly opposite the origin of replication suggests that these single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) guides arise from a region encompassing the terminus ( ter ), where replication of the circular chromosome and megaplasmid finishes, producing catenated daughter chromosomes that must be separated by topoisomerase II enzymes. Interestingly, a recent report for CbAgo produced in E. coli demonstrated acquisition of guides from the terminus ( Kuzmenko et al., 2020 39. Kuzmenko, A. ∙ Oguienko, A. ∙ Esyunina, D. ... DNA targeting and interference by a bacterial Argonaute nuclease. Nature. 2020; In press Crossref Scopus (96) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because the terminus for T. thermophilus has not yet been defined, we first used GC skew analysis, a method that identifies the origin and terminus of replication on the basis of the distinct nucleotide content of the leading and lagging DNA strands (skew calculated as [G-C]/[G+C]) ( Grigoriev, 1998 24. Grigoriev, A. Analyzing genomes with cumulative skew diagrams Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26 :2286-2290 Crossref Scopus (354) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cumulative GC skew analysis placed the ori of the strain HB27 chromosome at 1,541,431 bp, directly within a canonical binding sequence for the replication-initiating factor dnaA (1,540,040 bp for our lab strain), which typically initiates replication by binding sites immediately after its own coding sequence ( Schaper et al., 2000 69. Schaper, S. ∙ Nardmann, J. ∙ Lüder, G. ... Identification of the chromosomal replication origin from Thermus thermophilus and its interaction with the replication initiator DnaA J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299 :655-665 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 1 E). Cumulative GC skew analysis located the chromosomal terminus site 187° opposite the ori at 626,088 bp, within the region with which the co-immunoprecipitated small DNAs align ( Figure 1 E). This method also identified the terminus of the megaplasmid at 187° opposite its ori and within the 25-kbp region generating abundant TtAgo-bound small DNAs. Cumulative GC skew analysis showed that the 15- to 18-nt DNA guides associated with TtAgo in the T. thermophilus HB8 strain similarly map opposite the origin of replication ( Figure S1 E).
Second, we used high-throughput, short-read DNA sequencing to experimentally identify ori and ter . In actively growing bacteria, DNA replication typically initiates more often than it concludes. Consequently, chromosomal sequences from ori are over-represented, whereas those from ter are under-represented in logarithmically growing cells relative to those that have reached stationary phase ( Hawkins et al., 2013 28. Hawkins, M. ∙ Malla, S. ∙ Blythe, M.J. ... Accelerated growth in the absence of DNA replication origins Nature. 2013; 503 :544-547 Crossref Scopus (107) PubMed Google Scholar ; Koren et al., 2010 36. Koren, A. ∙ Soifer, I. ∙ Barkai, N. MRC1-dependent scaling of the budding yeast DNA replication timing program Genome Res. 2010; 20 :781-790 Crossref Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ). The ratio of logarithmic- to stationary-phase genomic sequencing coverage placed ter 183° clockwise from ori at 597,500 bp, again within the region producing abundant small DNAs bound to TtAgo ( Figure 1 E; Figure S1 F).
Guide acquisition by TtAgo is poorly understood. Purified TtAgo has been reported to cleave dsDNA without sequence specificity, suggesting that TtAgo itself initiates guide production ( Swarts et al., 2017 78. Swarts, D.C. ∙ Szczepaniak, M. ∙ Sheng, G. ... Autonomous Generation and Loading of DNA Guides by Bacterial Argonaute Mol. Cell. 2017; 65 :985-998.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ). Supporting this idea, small DNAs do not co-purify with catalytically inactive TtAgo D478A,D546A (hereafter called the double point mutant [TtAgo DM ]) when overexpressed in E. coli grown at 37°C ( Swarts et al., 2014 76. Swarts, D.C. ∙ Jore, M.M. ∙ Westra, E.R. ... DNA-guided DNA interference by a prokaryotic Argonaute Nature. 2014; 507 :258-261 Crossref Scopus (322) PubMed Google Scholar ). We produced mutant and wild-type TtAgo in E. coli and purified each protein to apparent homogeneity. In agreement with earlier studies of TtAgo DM , we did not detect small DNA-directed or sequence-independent cleavage of single-stranded target DNA during 16-h incubation at 65°C, even when purified TtAgo DM loaded with a small DNA guide was present 45,000-fold above its K D , a 50-fold excess over the ssDNA target fully complementary to the DNA guide ( Figure S2 A). Under these same conditions, purified wild-type TtAgo, guided by the same small DNA, cleaved the ssDNA target within 1 h; ssDNA cleavage required the small DNA guide. However, we failed to detect any cleavage of dsDNA by wild-type, purified, recombinant TtAgo in the presence or absence of a small DNA guide ( Figure S2 B). Notably, TtAgo bound dsDNA 40-fold more weakly than ssDNA ( Figure S2 C). Our data suggest that TtAgo is a DNA-guided ssDNA endonuclease devoid of detectable sequence-independent dsDNase activity.
Further evidence against a role of TtAgo in the initial DNA cleavage that generates its small DNA guides comes from analysis of the nucleic acids associated with catalytically inactive TtAgo DM in T. thermophilus grown at 65°C. As reported previously for TtAgo DM expressed in E. coli ( Swarts et al., 2014 76. Swarts, D.C. ∙ Jore, M.M. ∙ Westra, E.R. ... DNA-guided DNA interference by a prokaryotic Argonaute Nature. 2014; 507 :258-261 Crossref Scopus (322) PubMed Google Scholar ), in vivo , TtAgo DM bound 25- to 35-nt RNA ( Figure 2 A), and these small RNAs mapped throughout the genome. Unlike in E. coli , TtAgo DM from T. thermophilus also bound small DNA guides that typically began with cytidine ( Figure 2 B) and mapped to a region encompassing the chromosomal terminus ( Figure 2 C). Moreover, the DNA guides bound to TtAgo DM had the same length distribution as those bound to wild-type TtAgo ( Figure 2 D). Notably, 86% of the uniquely mapping small DNA sequences that co-immunoprecipitated with TtAgo DM also co-purified with wild-type TtAgo. However, the guides associated in vivo with the catalytically inactive protein were ~20-fold less plentiful than for wild-type TtAgo, even though wild-type and mutant TtAgo proteins accumulated to equivalent levels ( Figure 2 E). Recombinant TtAgo and TtAgo DM bind small DNA guides with similar affinities ( Figures S2 C), so it is unlikely that the failure of TtAgo DM to acquire wild-type levels of guide DNAs reflects a defect in binding ssDNA or dsDNA. Both proteins were immunoprecipitated with the same efficiency ( Figure S2 D). We conclude that the TtAgo DNA endonuclease participates in loading or amplification of DNA guides but not in their initial sequence selection.
The observation that TtAgo binds small DNA guides from sequences surrounding the chromosomal and megaplasmid termini suggests that, in vivo , the protein participates in DNA replication or genome maintenance. To explore this idea, we screened wild-type ( ago ) and null mutant (Δ ago ) HB27 strains for their susceptibility to a panel of replication inhibitors and DNA-damaging agents. We observed no difference in growth between ago and Δ ago grown in the presence of the DNA damaging agents 4-nitroquinoline N -oxide and methyl methanesulfonate, the DNA crosslinking agents cisplatin and mitomycin C, the ribonuclease reductase inhibitor hydroxyurea, or the gyrase subunit B inhibitor novobiocin. However, the Δ ago strain was more sensitive to the gyrase subunit A inhibitor ciprofloxacin than wild-type ago ( Figure 3 A; Figure S3 A). Increasing concentrations of ciprofloxacin further slowed the growth of Δ ago compared with the wild type but did not decrease the viability of the mutant strain until 15 μM ciprofloxacin, a concentration at which the wild-type and Δ ago strains were inviable ( Figure S3 B). When grown in ciprofloxacin, the abundance of TtAgo-associated small DNA guides mapping to the terminus increased ( Figure S4 ).
The mechanism by which the agents inhibit replication gives insight into the role of TtAgo in vivo . Hydroxyurea inhibits ribonucleotide reductase, depleting available dNTPs. The lack of differential susceptibility between ago and Δ ago suggests that replication elongation does not rely on TtAgo. The increased sensitivity of Δ ago to ciprofloxacin, which inhibits gyrase A, but not to novobiocin, which interferes with the B subunit of the gyrase heterodimer, further restricts the possible roles of TtAgo in DNA replication. Gyrase A cleaves both strands of dsDNA, forming a covalent DNA-enzyme bond. Gyrase B uses ATP energy to induce negative supercoiling ( Berger et al., 1996 6. Berger, J.M. ∙ Gamblin, S.J. ∙ Harrison, S.C. ... Structure and mechanism of DNA topoisomerase II Nature. 1996; 379 :225-232 Crossref Scopus (772) PubMed Google Scholar ). The negative twist generated by gyrase B is captured by re-ligation of the ends of the dsDNA by gyrase A. Gyrase can also use the same mechanism to unlink catenated dsDNA circles ( Aubry et al., 2006 3. Aubry, A. ∙ Fisher, L.M. ∙ Jarlier, V. ... First functional characterization of a singly expressed bacterial type II topoisomerase: the enzyme from Mycobacterium tuberculosis Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 348 :158-165 Crossref Scopus (88) PubMed Google Scholar ; Debowski et al., 2012 12. Debowski, A.W. ∙ Carnoy, C. ∙ Verbrugghe, P. ... Xer recombinase and genome integrity in Helicobacter pylori, a pathogen without topoisomerase IV PLoS ONE. 2012; 7 :e33310 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ). In E. coli , a second topoisomerase II enzyme, topo IV, decatenates the circular chromosomes generated by DNA replication. T. thermophilus lacks topo IV. Thus, the ability of gyrase A to break and rejoin dsDNA is predicted to decatenate replicated DNA in T. thermophilus . When gyrase A is inhibited by ciprofloxacin, T. thermophilus should therefore be unable to separate the catenated DNA circles generated by replication. Failure to decatenate daughter chromosomes is predicted to impair nucleoid segregation and prevent complete septation, causing individual cells to remain connected and form long filaments ( Piddock and Wise, 1987 61. Piddock, L.J.V. ∙ Wise, R. Induction of the SOS response in Escherichia coli by 4-quinolone antimicrobial agents FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1987; 41 :289-294 Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar ).
Contrary to this expectation, wild-type ago grew essentially normally ( Figure 3 B), showing only a modest increase in median cell length in the presence of ciprofloxacin ( Figures 3 C and 3D). In E. coli , ciprofloxacin inhibits gyrase and topo IV and triggers an SOS response that arrests cell division ( Piddock and Wise, 1987 61. Piddock, L.J.V. ∙ Wise, R. Induction of the SOS response in Escherichia coli by 4-quinolone antimicrobial agents FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1987; 41 :289-294 Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar ). In E. coli , the transcriptional repressor LexA normally blocks the SOS response; LexA is inactivated when RecA senses ssDNA. T. thermophilus lacks an identifiable LexA ortholog. Moreover, transcriptome profiling of wild-type ago cells grown in ciprofloxacin revealed no changes in gene expression consistent with an SOS response. How then does T. thermophilus complete replication without gyrase A function?
When gyrase A activity is inhibited, successful nucleoid segregation and septation require TtAgo: the Δ ago and ago DM strains formed long filaments when grown with ciprofloxacin ( Figure 3 C). When the medium contained ciprofloxacin, Δ ago and ago DM cells were significantly longer than wild-type, TtAgo-expressing cells (p = 3.8 × 10 −11 for both, Tukey test; Figure 3 D). Moreover, in the presence of ciprofloxacin, Δ ago cells were significantly longer than ago DM cells (p = 4.6 × 10 −11 , Tukey test), consistent with the small amount of DNA guides bound to TtAgo DM in the catalytically inactive ago DM strain allowing successful completion of replication in some dividing cells. We conclude that TtAgo, loaded with small DNA guides corresponding to the terminus, can facilitate completion of replication in T. thermophilus .
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy images of wild-type and mutant T. thermophilus strains grown in ciprofloxacin underscore the requirement for TtAgo in septation and nucleoid segregation. As seen by TEM, the daughter nucleoids of wild-type ago cells were set back from the cell wall, and individual cells were generally separated from each other ( Figure 4 A). In contrast, the daughter nucleoids of Δ ago and ago DM cells lay close to the stalled septal junctions within long filaments of incompletely separated cells. Longitudinal cross-sections of Δ ago and ago DM filaments showed that the nucleoids of adjacent segments were joined by a thin fiber that extended from cell to cell along the length of the filament. The presence of invaginated membrane regions and long DNA fibers indicates that a failure in partitioning rather than a septation defect leads to filamentation. To determine whether this fiber corresponds to DNA, we stained the cells with PicoGreen, a dye whose fluorescent emission increases ~2,000-fold when bound to dsDNA ( Singer et al., 1997 73. Singer, V.L. ∙ Jones, L.J. ∙ Yue, S.T. ... Characterization of PicoGreen reagent and development of a fluorescence-based solution assay for double-stranded DNA quantitation Anal. Biochem. 1997; 249 :228-238 Crossref Scopus (674) PubMed Google Scholar ), and examined them using STED microscopy ( Figure 4 B). In the presence of ciprofloxacin, the thin fiber extending between cells stained brightly with PicoGreen in Δ ago and ago DM cells, consistent with the cells being linked by dsDNA. No PicoGreen-staining material was observed between wild-type ago cells. We conclude that, in the absence of gyrase A and TtAgo function, newly replicated T. thermophilus chromosomal DNA cannot be decatenated, blocking completion of septation.
The identity of proteins associated with TtAgo by immunoprecipitation-tandem mass spectrometry (IP-MS/MS) suggests that the protein collaborates with recombination factors to generate DNA guides and separate catenated chromosomes ( Figures 5 A and 5B; Figure S5 ). The T. thermophilus genome encodes an AddA/AddB helicase-nuclease complex that, like RecBCD, initiates repair of double-strand breaks by homologous recombination and is required for completion of replication ( Cromie, 2009 10. Cromie, G.A. Phylogenetic ubiquity and shuffling of the bacterial RecBCD and AddAB recombination complexes J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191 :5076-5084 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kooistra and Venema, 1991 35. Kooistra, J. ∙ Venema, G. Cloning, sequencing, and expression of Bacillus subtilis genes involved in ATP-dependent nuclease synthesis J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173 :3644-3655 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Courcelle et al., 2015 7. Courcelle, J. ∙ Wendel, B.M. ∙ Livingstone, D.D. ... RecBCD is required to complete chromosomal replication: Implications for double-strand break frequencies and repair mechanisms DNA Repair (Amst.). 2015; 32 :86-95 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ). MS analysis of the proteins that specifically co-immunoprecipitated with TtAgo identified AddA and AddB as well as the recombination factors Rad52 and ArgR (XerA), the ssDNA-binding protein SSB, and the histone-like protein HU, consistent with TtAgo acting at DNA. (TtAgo appears to bind sites of persistent ssDNA generally; RepA, which initiates DNA copying at oriC , also co-purified with TtAgo, and TtAgo bound some small DNAs mapping to the origin of replication.) ( Figure 1 E)
Supporting the idea that TtAgo acquires its guides from the stalled replication forks that accumulate at the end of replication of circular chromosomes, TtAgo co-purified with PriA, which helps re-start stalled replication forks; RecJ, an exonuclease that repairs stalled forks; Topo I, which relieves negative supercoiling behind replication forks; and PolA, which replaces the RNA primers on the lagging strand of the fork with DNA. Proteins acting at the end of replication (GyrA and GyrB) and in DNA repair (UvrB) also co-immunoprecipitated with TtAgo. Many of these TtAgo-interacting proteins likely bind via protein-protein interactions because their association persisted when the immunoprecipitate was incubated with DNase and washed extensively ( Figure 5 ; Figures S5 A and S5B). Qubit analysis demonstrated that DNase reduced the abundance of DNA in the immunoprecipitate 7-fold. Many of the proteins associated with wild-type TtAgo also associated with catalytically inactive TtAgo DM , despite the mutant protein binding more than 20-fold fewer small DNA guides ( Figure 5 ). Notably, the recombination proteins AddA and AddB, which co-purified with wild-type TtAgo, were not significantly associated with TtAgo DM , perhaps because they only bind TtAgo loaded with a small DNA guide. Figure S5 C and Table S2 provide a list of proteins specifically co-immunoprecipitating with TtAgo.
T. thermophilus is unlikely to encounter ciprofloxacin in the wild. To test whether TtAgo confers a selective advantage to the bacterium, we mixed equal numbers of ago and Δ ago logarithmic-phase cells and cultured them in rich medium at 65°C by serial passage (1:40) into fresh medium every 12 h for 12 days ( Figure 6 ). Long-read sequencing confirmed that, except for the presence or absence of the gene encoding TtAgo ( ago ), the two strains were isogenic, and both contained, at the identical genomic location, the gene htk , which encodes a highly thermostable kanamycin nucleotidyltransferase and confers resistance to kanamycin. At the beginning (day 0) and end (day 12) of the experiment, we used short-read genomic sequencing to determine the coverage ratio of ago to htk and calculate the relative abundance of the individual strains ( Figure 6 ). Over 12 days, the abundance of wild-type ago increased significantly compared with Δ ago (mean increase, 1.7 ± 0.3, two-tailed, paired t test, p = 0.022, n = 3). Although a role of TtAgo in defense against phage infection has not been demonstrated, we wanted to find out whether the decreased fitness of Δ ago might reflect a subacute phage infection acquired over 12 days of continuous culture. Our data argue against such an explanation. We detected ~0.02 phage genomes per cell (1.25 fpkm), and the abundance of reads mapping to known phage were comparable at the beginning and end of the experiment. We conclude that, even when gyrase activity is unimpaired, TtAgo confers a growth advantage to T. thermophilus .
Figure 7 depicts our model for guide acquisition by TtAgo. The model attempts to incorporate the known biochemical properties of the protein. Although TtAgo guide DNAs typically begin with cytidine (g1C), the protein displays no binding preference for a 5′ C ( Swarts et al., 2017 78. Swarts, D.C. ∙ Szczepaniak, M. ∙ Sheng, G. ... Autonomous Generation and Loading of DNA Guides by Bacterial Argonaute Mol. Cell. 2017; 65 :985-998.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ). Instead, TtAgo prefers to bind targets with a G in the t1 position. Like other AGO proteins, TtAgo uses a pocket in its MID domain to bind the 5′ phosphate of its guide, preventing the g1 nucleotide from base-pairing with the target ( Sheng et al., 2014 71. Sheng, G. ∙ Zhao, H. ∙ Wang, J. ... Structure-based cleavage mechanism of Thermus thermophilus Argonaute DNA guide strand-mediated DNA target cleavage Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111 :652-657 Crossref Scopus (156) PubMed Google Scholar ). A second pocket in the PIWI domain recognizes a guanosine nucleotide at the t1 position ( Swarts et al., 2017 78. Swarts, D.C. ∙ Szczepaniak, M. ∙ Sheng, G. ... Autonomous Generation and Loading of DNA Guides by Bacterial Argonaute Mol. Cell. 2017; 65 :985-998.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ). Further support for a t1G preference comes from single-molecule analysis of TtAgo binding a partially complementary target ( Smith et al., 2019 74. Smith, C.S. ∙ Jouravleva, K. ∙ Huisman, M. ... An automated Bayesian pipeline for rapid analysis of single-molecule binding data Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :272 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ). Those experiments examined the binding kinetics of TtAgo bearing a 16-nt g1T guide DNA. The experiments used a series of target DNAs complementary only to the seed sequence of the guide (t2–t8) but differing in their t1 nucleotide. TtAgo found the binding site in each of the targets at a similar rate (binding rate [ k on ] = 3.2 ± 0.1 × 10 7 to 5.5 ± 0.1 × 10 7 M −1 s −1 ). In contrast, the mean dwell time for the t1G target (τ = 10 s, corresponding to k off = 0.10 ± 0.01 s −1 ) was 10 times longer than for the t1A, t1C, or t1T targets (τ = 0.91–1.4 s, corresponding to k off = 0.70 ± 0.01 to 1.10 ± 0.01 s −1 ). Together, these data, acquired by multiple independent methods, establish that a preference for t1G targets generates the g1C bias of TtAgo-bound guide DNAs.
For TtAgo to acquire g1C guides because it has a higher affinity for t1G targets, the protein must initially acquire its guides from dsDNA. As replication forks approach the terminus, forks stall, causing nicks and dsDNA breaks ( Kuzminov, 2001 41. Kuzminov, A. Single-strand interruptions in replicating chromosomes cause double-strand breaks Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98 :8241-8246 Crossref Scopus (315) PubMed Google Scholar ; Michel et al., 2001 53. Michel, B. ∙ Flores, M.J. ∙ Viguera, E. ... Rescue of arrested replication forks by homologous recombination Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98 :8181-8188 Crossref Scopus (255) PubMed Google Scholar ). We propose that TtAgo binds a free 5′ monophosphate at nicks beginning with a 5′ cytidine, reflecting the protein’s preference for targets bearing a guanosine across from the first guide nucleotide. Such an idea is biochemically reasonable because the protein’s in vivo concentration (>200 nM) far exceeds its in vitro K D (30 nM) for binding 5′ monophosphorylated dsDNA. Notably, wild-type TtAgo and catalytically inactive TtAgo DM bind DNA with the same affinity in vitro ( Figure S2 C), and in vivo , their guides show the same g1C bias and derive from the same genomic region ( Figures 2 B and 2C). Unlike wild-type TtAgo, whose guides derive from the lagging and leading strands, TtAgo DM binds mainly guides from the lagging strands ( Figure 2 C).
Our in vivo data argue against TtAgo acquiring guides from a pre-existing pool of short ssDNAs. First, we detect no peak of 15- to 18-nt DNAs in Δ ago ( Figure 2 D). Second, all 15- to 18-nt DNAs detectable above the broad background present in Δ ago co-immunoprecipitated with TtAgo and TtAgo DM . The small DNAs remaining in the TtAgo-depleted supernatant showed no 5′ cytidine bias ( Figure 2 B) and were broadly distributed across all lengths sequenced (14 to ~26 nt) ( Figure 2 D), consistent with the idea that in vivo guide-length ssDNAs are not found outside of TtAgo. These data alone cannot exclude a model in which free ssDNAs are generally unstable, so that only ssDNA bound to TtAgo would be detectable. However, the absence of a TtAgo g1 nucleotide preference argues against ssDNA serving as the initial substrate for DNA guide generation.
By analogy to AGO2 loading in arthropods ( Matranga et al., 2005 52. Matranga, C. ∙ Tomari, Y. ∙ Shin, C. ... Passenger-strand cleavage facilitates assembly of siRNA into Ago2-containing RNAi enzyme complexes Cell. 2005; 123 :607-620 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (889) PubMed Google Scholar ; Miyoshi et al., 2005 54. Miyoshi, K. ∙ Tsukumo, H. ∙ Nagami, T. ... Slicer function of Drosophila Argonautes and its involvement in RISC formation Genes Dev. 2005; 19 :2837-2848 Crossref Scopus (323) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rand et al., 2005 64. Rand, T.A. ∙ Petersen, S. ∙ Du, F. ... Argonaute2 cleaves the anti-guide strand of siRNA during RISC activation Cell. 2005; 123 :621-629 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (611) PubMed Google Scholar ), we propose that TtAgo would next cleave the passenger DNA strand between positions t10 and t11. This cleavage event would allow the passenger strand DNA to dissociate, generating a partially single-stranded complex of TtAgo, a guide DNA precursor, and nicked target DNA. Supporting this idea, we find that, at 55°C, a target complementary only to guide positions g2–g10 dissociates rapidly, even when the t1 nucleotide is G ( k off = 3.23 ± 0.02 s −1 , corresponding to τ = 300 ms) ( Figure 7 B). In contrast, a much longer long dwell time is observed at 55°C for fully complementary target DNAs ( k off < 0.077 s −1 , corresponding to τ = 13 s) ( Smith et al., 2019 74. Smith, C.S. ∙ Jouravleva, K. ∙ Huisman, M. ... An automated Bayesian pipeline for rapid analysis of single-molecule binding data Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :272 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ). A requirement for target cleavage in efficient guide acquisition would explain why catalytically inactive TtAgo DM is largely devoid of guides in vivo ( Figures 2 A and 2E).
The proposal that TtAgo acquires its guides from nicked dsDNA and promotes dsDNA unwinding by cleaving the opposite DNA strand predicts that catalytically inactive TtAgo DM would be unable to generate guides from sequences with high duplex stability. To test this idea, we estimated the DNA duplex stability at 65°C (Δ G ) of the genomic sequence corresponding to nucleotides g1–g14 for the 14- to 19-nt-long DNA guides bound to wild-type or mutant TtAgo. In contrast to wild-type TtAgo, whose guides derive equally from genomic sequences spanning a broad range of predicted stabilities, the guides bound to TtAgo DM favored sequences with lower predicted duplex stability ( Figure S6 A). The median GC content of the guides bound to TtAgo DM is essentially identical to that of the genome as a whole, the guide-generating region flanking the terminus, and randomly selected genomic sequences ( Figures S6 B and S6C). Together, our data strongly favor TtAgo acquiring its guides from nicked dsDNA ( Figure 7 A; Figure S6 D).
Next we envision TtAgo binding the AddAB complex, whose 5′-to-3′ and 3′-to-5′ exonuclease activities would serve to degrade the excess target DNA strand and trim the 3′ end of the guide strand. These events would require a downstream dsDNA break, such as those generated by replication forks colliding at the end of replication. Exonucleolytic trimming would generate a loading intermediate in which the remaining 6-nt double-stranded region of the guide DNA would dissociate rapidly at 65°C, generating a 16-nt DNA guide bound to TtAgo.

Section: Discussion

AGO proteins defend against viral infection, silence transposons, inhibit transformation by plasmids, direct transcriptional silencing, promote mRNA decay, and repress translation. Our data expand the list of AGO functions to include ensuring successful replication of circular chromosomes; in vivo , TtAgo binds ~16-nt DNA guides derived from the terminus of replication and facilitates decatenation, enabling subsequent nucleoid segregation and cytokinesis. Our data suggest that TtAgo not only functions in chromosomal replication when gyrase A is inhibited; over 12 days growing in non-selective medium, an isogenic wild-type ago strain outcompetes the Δ ago null mutant. Thus, the Δ ago strain is less fit than the TtAgo-expressing wild type. Future experiments will be needed to determine whether, over a longer timescale, the wild-type strain fully displaces the mutant bacteria.
How does TtAgo, a DNA-guided, DNA-binding DNA endonuclease, facilitate chromosome decatenation? Under normal physiological conditions, the gyrase heterodimers first cut both DNA strands of one newly replicated chromosome in the terminus, forming a covalent DNA-enzyme complex with one strand of each of the two resulting gate segments (G segments) ( Sugino et al., 1977 75. Sugino, A. ∙ Peebles, C.L. ∙ Kreuzer, K.N. ... Mechanism of action of nalidixic acid: purification of Escherichia coli nalA gene product and its relationship to DNA gyrase and a novel nicking-closing enzyme Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1977; 74 :4767-4771 Crossref Scopus (589) PubMed Google Scholar ). The other daughter chromosome, the transfer segment, is passed through this break, decatenating the two circles. Finally, the G segments covalently linked to gyrase A are ligated to each other, regenerating a circular chromosome and allowing the two chromosome copies to partition between daughter cells. In the presence of ciprofloxacin, the G segments are trapped as DNA-enzyme intermediates, blocking decatenation and eliciting filamentation. We propose that the TtAgo-guide complex can bypass this block by binding complementary ssDNA sequences in the terminus ( Nurse et al., 2003 55. Nurse, P. ∙ Levine, C. ∙ Hassing, H. ... Topoisomerase III can serve as the cellular decatenase in Escherichia coli J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278 :8653-8660 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (73) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S7 ). When bound, TtAgo resolves catenanes (1) by slicing the ssDNA to generate a double-strand break that can then be resected by TtAgo-associated AddAB, triggering recombination, or (2) by simply bringing recombination factors, such as Rad52, ArgR (XerA), or AddAB, to the terminus. We favor the second model because (1) the requirement for TtAgo endonucleolytic activity can be explained by its role in generating ssDNA guides loaded into the protein, and (2) the severity of filamentation in the catalytically inactive ago DM strain, which produces a low level of guides derived from the terminus, was significantly less than in Δ ago . Our data suggest that small DNA guides derived from the terminus direct TtAgo to the terminus and that TtAgo-associated proteins, rather than endonucleolytic cleavage of DNA, drive decatenation itself. Published observations provide additional support for this model: (1) expression of the TtAgo MID-PIWI domain in E. coli enhances sequence-directed recombination ( Fu et al., 2019 18. Fu, L. ∙ Xie, C. ∙ Jin, Z. ... The prokaryotic Argonaute proteins enhance homology sequence-directed recombination in bacteria Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 :3568-3579 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ), and (2) in E. coli , a region identical in size and location to the T. thermophilus small DNA locus is a site of hyperrecombination ( Hill, 1996 31. Hill, T.M. Features of the chromosomal terminus region Neidhardt, F.C. (Editor) Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology The University of Chicago Press, 1996; 1602-1614 Google Scholar ; Louarn et al., 1994 49. Louarn, J. ∙ Cornet, F. ∙ François, V. ... Hyperrecombination in the terminus region of the Escherichia coli chromosome: possible relation to nucleoid organization J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176 :7524-7531 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ).
Do AGO proteins decatenate chromosomes or otherwise participate in DNA replication, recombination, or repair in other prokaryotes? Although AGO proteins can be found across prokaryotes, only some are predicted to retain cleavage activity ( Ryazansky et al., 2018 67. Ryazansky, S. ∙ Kulbachinskiy, A. ∙ Aravin, A.A. The Expanded Universe of Prokaryotic Argonaute Proteins MBio. 2018; 9 :e01935-18 Crossref Scopus (84) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our data suggest that species harboring catalytically active AGO proteins comprise the most promising candidates for exploration. A broad survey of these strains might require development of a metagenomics approach to identifying AGO guides in complex mixtures of bacteria. Given the growing problem of bacterial resistance to antibiotics, identifying AGO functions in prokaryotes could be a starting point for developing drugs that block DNA replication or cytokinesis for use in combination with existing antibiotics targeting gyrase A or topo IV.

Δ ago :: htk and ago :: htk strains were prepared by recombining into the wild-type HB27 strain. ago D478A,D546A :: htk was prepared by first recombining ago D478A,D546A :: hyg into the Δ ago :: htk strain and subsequent replacing hyg with htk . Genomic sequencing of all strains confirmed that mutations or deletions existed as designed and in all copies of the genome.
Strains were grown in ATCC-697 media (HB27; 0.8% (w/v) polypeptone, 0.4% (w/v) yeast extract, 0.2% (w/v) sodium chloride, pH 7.5 with NaOH) or TB media (HB8; 0.8% (w/v) polypeptone, 0.4% (w/v) yeast extract, 0.3% (w/v) sodium chloride, 0.5 mM calcium chloride, 1 mM magnesium chloride, pH 7.5 with NaOH). For HB27 strains, overnight cultures were started by adding glycerol stocks to 5 mL ATCC-697 media and incubating at 65°C with 300 rpm shaking for 12–15 h. Experimental cultures were started by seeding fresh ATCC-697 media with overnight culture to achieve 2–3 × 10 7 cells/mL, then incubating at 65°C with shaking at 250 rpm. For growth in ciprofloxacin, 40 mL of a 100 mL seed culture at OD 600 = 0.5 was added to a flask containing 166 μg (5 × 10 −4 moles) ciprofloxacin (17850, Sigma, USA) dried onto the bottom from an 0.05 M stock in 0.1 N HCl, achieving a final concentration of 12.5 μM ciprofloxacin. Cultures were allowed to grow at 65°C for 8 h with 250 rpm shaking achieving OD 600 = 2−2.5.
Bacteria were plated on TR-plates (1.5% (w/v) gellan gum [Alfa Aesar J63423A1], 0.4% (w/v) polypeptone, 0.2% (w/v) yeast extract, 0.1% (w/v) sodium chloride, 1.5 mM calcium chloride, 1.5 mM magnesium chloride, pH 7.5 with NaOH) were prepared, dried overnight and stored at 4°C until use. Following inoculation, plates were incubated at 65°C for 18–24 h in plastic bags containing damp paper towels. For spot plating assays, the agar was equilibrated to 70°C before adding the inhibitor. Each strain was grown to OD 600 = 0.5 and serially diluted fivefold and added to a 96-well plate. A frogger was dipped into the well and stamped onto an agar plate containing inhibitor. Between agar plates, the frogger was dipped into a 96-well plate containing fresh media that was changed before use with a different inhibitor. Plates were incubated at 65°C for 15 min right side up, then placed in sealed bags containing damp paper towels and incubated upside down at 65°C for 18 h.
A liquid culture grown to OD 600 = 0.5 was diluted 1:500,000, and then 25 μL was spread on TR-plates containing vehicle (0.1 N HCl), 7.5 μM, 10 μM, 12.5 μM or 15 μM ciprofloxacin. Plates were incubated at 65°C for 15 min right side up, then were placed in sealed bags containing damp paper towels and incubated upside down at 65°C for 24 h. Images were acquired using an Amersham Imager 600 (GE healthcare, USA) and colony diameter determined using ImageJ (Fuji). The number of colonies was counted without respect to colony size.
Cultures were grown in the absence or presence of 12.5 μM ciprofloxacin as described above. After 8 h, 80 μL of the culture was added to 320 μL fresh media, allowed to cool to room temperature, and then 1 mL 4% paraformaldehyde in Dulbecco’s phosphate buffered saline (PBS, 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 8 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 2 mM KH 2 PO 4 ; GIBCO, 14190-144) was added and incubated 10 min at room temperature. The suspension was centrifuged at 1,000 × g at 4°C for 5 min and the supernatant removed. Cells were washed twice with 1 mL PBS. The final cell pellet was re-suspended in 150 μL PBS, and then 5 μL of the suspension was placed on a thin 1% (w/v) agar pad on a microscope slide. ProLong Gold (Invitrogen, P369931) mounting agent was added to the agar pad, capped with a coverslip, and the slides were allowed to cure overnight at room temperature. Slides were imaged on a Leica DMi8 by DIC microscopy with a 63 × /NA 1.4 oil immersion objective. Fields with minimally overlapping bacteria were identified and stitched images of 3 × 3 panels acquired.
Overnight cultures of ago and Δ ago strains were grown from glycerol stocks and then diluted (f.c. 3 × 10 7 cells/mL) into fresh ATCC-697 media. The separate cultures were each grown to OD 600 = 0.5, and then 4 × 10 9 cells of each strain were added to fresh ATCC-697 media (250 mL final volume) and incubated at 65°C with 250 rpm shaking. Every 12 h, 1 mL of the mixed culture was transferred to 40 mL fresh ATCC-697 media and the incubation continued. Aliquots were collected at day 0 (200 mL) and day 12 (5 mL) by centrifugation at 7,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. The cell pellets washed three times with 1 × Dulbecco′s PBS, then flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C. Genomic DNA was isolated as described for long read genomic sequencing, and prepared for sequencing as described in short read genomic sequencing.
Bacteria were grown to logarithmic (OD 600 = 0.5) or stationary phase (8 h after OD 600 = 0.5), collected at 7,000 × g for 10 min, and washed three times with 1 × Dulbecco′s PBS. Cells were re-suspended in lysis buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 100 mM potassium chloride, 5 mM magnesium chloride, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 mM 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, 0.3 μM aprotinin, 40 μM Bestatin, 10 μM E-64, 10 μM leupeptin hemisulfate) to make a 10% (w/v) suspension and lysed (1) using a microfluidizer (Microfluidics M-110P), passing the suspension once at 18,000 psi with cooling or (2) by sonication (Fisher Scientific, Sonic Dismembrator FB-120) on ice for four 30 s cycles at 40% amplitude with 30 s rest between cycles. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C, aliquoted into tubes, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C.
Wild-type or mutant TtAgo (TtAgo D478A,D546A or TtAgo DM ) cloned and expressed from pET-SUMO (Invitrogen K30001) in E. coli BL21-DE3 was purified as described ( Wang et al., 2008a 81. Wang, Y. ∙ Juranek, S. ∙ Li, H. ... Structure of an argonaute silencing complex with a seed-containing guide DNA and target RNA duplex Nature. 2008; 456 :921-926 Crossref Scopus (462) PubMed Google Scholar ) except: (1) After cleavage and removal of the 6 × His-SUMO tag, wild-type or mutant TtAgo was additionally purified by HiTrap SP HP (GE Healthcare) chromatography, dialyzed against 3 × 2 L 20 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.4, 250 mM potassium acetate, 3 mM magnesium acetate, 0.1 mM 2,2′,2″,2″′-(ethane-1,2-diyldinitrilo)tetraacetic acid, 10% glycerol (w/v), 5 mM DTT (TtAgo) or 30 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 250 mM potassium acetate, 1 mM DTT, 0.01% Igepal CA-630, 20% [v/v] glycerol (TtAgo DM ). Purified protein was aliquoted into tubes, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C. Protein was quantified by Bradford Assay using BSA as standard or by amino acid analysis (Protein Structure Core Facility, University of Nebraska Medical Center). Purification of TtAgo with magnesium buffers yields guide-free TtAgo and purification with manganese containing buffers retains endogenous guides ( Swarts et al., 2014 76. Swarts, D.C. ∙ Jore, M.M. ∙ Westra, E.R. ... DNA-guided DNA interference by a prokaryotic Argonaute Nature. 2014; 507 :258-261 Crossref Scopus (322) PubMed Google Scholar ). TtAgo, purified as above with magnesium containing buffers, has an A 260 /A 280 ratio of 0.56, indicating it to be free of nucleic acids. SYBR Gold (Invitrogen) staining did not detect nucleic acids.
Untagged, recombinant TtAgo (1.3 mg/animal) was excised from a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and submitted for development of rabbit anti-TtAgo polyclonal antibodies (Pocono Rabbit Farm and Lab, Inc., Pennsylvania). After 70 days, rabbits were exsanguinated, and antibodies purified from sera using recombinant TtAgo covalently attached to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose (Sigma Aldrich, C9142). Column was washed with 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.2) and eluted with 0.1 M glycine (pH 2.8) immediately neutralized with 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 9.0). Antibody-containing fractions were combined, aliquoted, flash frozen, and stored at −80°C.
Binding assays were performed as described ( Wee et al., 2012 83. Wee, L.M. ∙ Flores-Jasso, C.F. ∙ Salomon, W.E. ... Argonaute divides its RNA guide into domains with distinct functions and RNA-binding properties Cell. 2012; 151 :1055-1067 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (282) PubMed Google Scholar ) except that for stoichiometric binding to compare TtAgo and TtAgo DM , protein was incubated with ssDNA guides at 75°C for 15 min and then allowed to cool to room temperature before assaying and 10 nM radiolabeled guide was used.
Samples were adjusted to 60 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 2% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 0.1 M DTT, 0.1% (w/v) bromophenol blue, heated at 95°C for 5 min, and resolved by electrophoresis through a 4%–20% Tris-glycine gel (Invitrogen, XP04025). Proteins were transferred at 40V for 14 h (Bio-Rad Mini Trans-Blot) from the gel to PVDF membrane (Millipore, IPVH00010), blocked with blocking buffer (Rockland Immunochemicals, MB-070) for 30 min at room temperature, and incubated for 60 min at room temperature with affinity-purified rabbit anti-TtAgo polyclonal antibody diluted 1:4,000 in blocking buffer. Membrane was washed for 10 min at room temperature with TBST (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 150 mM sodium chloride, 0.01% (w/v) Tween-20) five times, incubated with goat anti-rabbit IRDye 800CW secondary antibody (LI-Cor Biosciences, 926-32211, 1:15,000 in blocking buffer) at room temperature for 60 min protected from light, washed four times for 10 min each at room temperature with TBST, and once with TBST containing 0.01% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate. Buffer was replaced with TBST, and membrane imaged (Odyssey Infrared Imaging System, Li-Cor).
Affinity-purified anti-TtAgo rabbit polyclonal antibody was bound to Protein A paramagnetic beads (Invitrogen, 10002D) for 15 min, rotating end-over-end. Antibody was crosslinked to beads only for mass spectrometry experiments and was performed using bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (Invitrogen, 21580) according to the manufacturer’s protocol; for all other immunoprecipitations no crosslinking of antibody was performed. Crosslinked antibody-bead complexes were used at 8 μg antibody/mg total protein; non-crosslinked antibody-bead complexes were used at 4 μg antibody/mg total protein. Antibody-bead complexes were incubated with cell lysates for 60 min at room temperature, washed three times with lysis buffer when isolating TtAgo-associated proteins or with lysis buffer containing 0.5% (w/v) Igepal CA-630 when isolating TtAgo-bound nucleic acids. Proteins were eluted in 25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM sodium chloride, 1% (w/v) Igepal CA-630, 1% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 2% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate, 1 mM DTT or in 120 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 4% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate, 20% (w/v) glycerol, 0.2 M DTT and 0.2% bromophenol blue (w/v) with heating at 95°C for 5 min.
Nucleic acids were characterized from total lysate and following immunoprecipitation of TtAgo from T. thermophilus lysate (2.5 mg total protein) and examining the supernatant and TtAgo-bound portions. For total lysates (2.5 mg total protein) and supernatants (2.5 mg total protein depleted of TtAgo), 1 volume of 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM sodium chloride, 12.5 mM 2,2′,2″,2″′-(Ethane-1,2-diyldinitrilo)tetraacetic acid, 1% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate (600 μL). Proteinase K (Denville Scientific, CB3200-7) was added (f.c. 2,000 μg/mL). Immune complexes on beads were suspended in 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM sodium chloride, 12.5 mM 2,2′,2″,2″′-(Ethane-1,2-diyldinitrilo)tetraacetic acid, 1% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate (400 μL). Proteinase K (Denville Scientific, CB3200-7) was added (f.c. 200 μg/mL). The lysate and supernatant solutions, and the immunoprecipitated bead suspensions were heated at 37°C for 1–3 h, and complete protein digestion confirmed by SDS-PAGE with silver staining (Pierce, 24612). Nucleic acids were isolated by ethanol precipitation, and taken up in 50 mM Bis-tris-propane-HCl pH 6, 1 mM magnesium chloride, 0.1 mM zinc chloride and treated (1) with Antarctic phosphatase (NEB, M0289) or (2) without enzyme (to identify 5′-phosphorylation state) at 37°C for 30 min. Phosphatase was inactivated at 80°C for 2 min. The phosphatase treated nucleic acids were forward labeled with γ- 32 P-ATP in 70 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 10 mM magnesium chloride, 5 mM DTT, and 15 U T4 Polynucleotide kinase (NEB, M0201)at 37°C for 30 min. The non-phosphatase treated nucleic acids were exchange labeled with the above buffer supplemented with 1 mM ADP. Free nucleotides were removed with a MicroSpin G-25 column (GE Healthcare). A portion of the flow through was treated with RQ1 DNase (2U, Promega, M6101) or RNase A/T1 cocktail (0.5U/20U, Invitrogen, AM2286) in 40 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 10 mM magnesium sulfate, 1 mM calcium chloride at 37°C for 30 min. Reactions were stopped by adding an equal volume of 200 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 300 mM sodium chloride, 25 mM 2,2′,2″,2″′-(Ethane-1,2-diyldinitrilo)tetraacetic acid, 2% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate containing Proteinase K (f.c. 200 μg/mL) and incubated at 50°C for 15 min. The reaction was extracted with 25:24:1 phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol pH 8.0, precipitated with ethanol, and resolved by 15% urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gel was dried and imaged with a Typhoon FLA 7000 phosphorimager (GE Healthcare).
Immunoprecipitates on antibody beads were incubated in 400 μL of 200 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 300 mM sodium chloride, 25 mM 2,2′,2″,2″′-(ethane-1,2-diyldinitrilo)tetraacetic acid, 2% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate containing Proteinase K (f.c. 200 μg/mL) at 37°C for 3 h. Nucleic acids were recovered by ethanol precipitation, treated with RNase A/T1 (0.5 U and 20 U, respectively; Invitrogen, AM2286) in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.9, 100 mM sodium chloride, 10 mM magnesium chloride, 1 mM DTT at 37°C for 30 min, then extracted with 25:24:1 phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (pH 8.0), and the DNA was precipitated with ethanol and dissolved in water (20 μL). To one quarter of the immunoprecipitated DNA (5 μL) was added a total of either 3 or 12 fmoles of an equimolar mixture of six distinct oligonucleotide spike-ins ( Table S1 ) in 5 μL. Next 10 μL formamide loading buffer (98% (w/v) deionized formamide, 10 mM EDTA, 0.025% (w/v) xylene cyanol, 0.025% (w/v) bromophenol blue) was added, the sample heated at 95°C for 5 min and then resolved by electrophoresis through a denaturing 15% polyacrylamide gel. Separate gels were used to purify DNA from each strain to prevent cross-contamination. The region of the gel corresponding to 12–25 nt was excised, crushed, and incubated in 1.2 mL 30 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.4, 300 mM sodium chloride, 25 mM EDTA, 2% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate at room temperature for 14 h, and following filtration of the gel fragments. DNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation and dissolved in water (20 μL). Before ligation, duplexes of adaptor and bridge oligonucleotides were annealed by adding 192 μL 100 μM bridge oligonucleotide and 160 μL 100 μM of the corresponding adaptor oligonucleotide ( Table S1 ), 40 μL buffer (500 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM magnesium chloride, 10 mM rATP, 100 mM DTT) to 8 μL water and heated to 95°C for 2 min, and then allowed to cool to room temperature. To the size-selected DNA in water (10 μL) was added 2 μL buffer (500 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM magnesium chloride, 10 mM rATP, 100 mM DTT), 2.5 μL pre-annealed 3′-adaptor duplex (100 pmoles; Table S1 ), 2.5 μL pre-annealed 5′-adaptor duplex (100 pmoles; Table S1), 2 μL PEG8000 (50% v/v in water) and 1 μL T4 DNA Ligase (400 U, NEB M0202), and the reaction heated at 30°C for 4 h. The reaction was adjusted to 300 mM sodium chloride, precipitated with ethanol and purified by electrophoresis through a denaturing 10% polyacrylamide gel. Gels were stained by SYBR-Gold, bands excised and eluted into 0.3 M sodium chloride, and finally recovered by precipitation with ethanol. The library was amplified and purified as reported for small RNA sequencing ( Han et al., 2015 26. Han, B.W. ∙ Wang, W. ∙ Li, C. ... Noncoding RNA. piRNA-guided transposon cleavage initiates Zucchini-dependent, phased piRNA production Science. 2015; 348 :817-821 Crossref Scopus (269) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Immunoprecipitated DNA was isolated as above for small DNA sequencing with the exception that no size selection step was used. The DNA average length by Bioanalyzer (Agilent, USA) was 1,156 bp. The sequencing library was prepared by sequentially performing end-repair, A-tailing, Y-shaped adaptor ligation, and PCR amplification as described ( Zhang et al., 2012 89. Zhang, Z. ∙ Theurkauf, W.E. ∙ Weng, Z. ... Strand-specific libraries for high throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) prepared without poly(A) selection Silence. 2012; 3 :9 Crossref Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar ) and sequenced using a NextSeq 500 (Illumina) to obtain 75 nt, paired-end reads.
Cultures were grown as above except that cell pellets were isolated at OD 650 = 0.1 for logarithmic phase and OD 650 = 1.4 for stationary phase ( Hawkins et al., 2013 28. Hawkins, M. ∙ Malla, S. ∙ Blythe, M.J. ... Accelerated growth in the absence of DNA replication origins Nature. 2013; 503 :544-547 Crossref Scopus (107) PubMed Google Scholar ). Genomic DNA was isolated as described for long read genomic sequencing, and the DNA (1–3 μg) was sheared (E220 Evolution, Covaris Inc., USA) for 180–210 s with duty cycle 10%, min/max temperature 2/25°C, peak power 175 W, and 180 cycles/burst to achieve ~250 bp fragments. The sequencing library was prepared by sequentially performing end-repair, A-tailing, Y-shaped adaptor ligation, and PCR amplification as described ( Zhang et al., 2012 89. Zhang, Z. ∙ Theurkauf, W.E. ∙ Weng, Z. ... Strand-specific libraries for high throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) prepared without poly(A) selection Silence. 2012; 3 :9 Crossref Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar ) except that unique molecular identifiers were used ( Fu et al., 2018 17. Fu, Y. ∙ Wu, P.H. ∙ Beane, T. ... Elimination of PCR duplicates in RNA-seq and small RNA-seq using unique molecular identifiers BMC Genomics. 2018; 19 :531 Crossref Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ). The libraries were sequenced using a NextSeq 500 (Illumina) to obtain 75 nt, paired-end reads.
Stationary phase Thermus thermophilus cells (0.4 g) were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mM sodium chloride, 25 mM 2,2′,2″,2″′-(Ethane-1,2-diyldinitrilo)tetraacetic acid, 2% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate. Genomic DNA was isolated as described ( Green and Sambrook, 2017 23. Green, M.R. ∙ Sambrook, J. Isolating DNA from Gram-Negative Bacteria Cold Spring Harb. Protoc. 2017; 2017 pdb.prot093369 Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar ) except that the DNA was not sheared during isolation. Genomic DNA was submitted to the University of Massachusetts Medical School Deep Sequencing Pac-Bio Core for library preparation, sequencing using a PacBio RS or Sequel II, and genome assembly using HGAP2 or HGAP4.
Cultures were grown in the presence of 12.5 μM ciprofloxacin as described above. After 8 h, 100 μL was diluted into 400 μL ice-cold Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS; Na 2 PO 4 , NaCl, NaHCO 3 , KH 2 PO 4 , KCl; pH 7.4; mOsm = 290; Invitrogen, 14175). A 1 mL volume of 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde in HBSS was added and incubated on ice for 10 min. The suspension was centrifuged at 1,000 × g at 4°C for 3 min. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet re-suspended in 1 mL HBSS. The cells were centrifuged as before, the supernatant removed, and then the cells were re-suspended in 1 mL HBSS. Of this suspension, 150 μL were diluted into 600 μL HBSS to make a dilute cell suspension. To 100 μL of the dilute cell suspension was added 100 μL PicoGreen (Invitrogen, P7581) diluted 1:200 in TE (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA), which was then incubated at room temperature in the dark for 10 min. Stained cells (10 μL) were added to a #1.5 coverslip (VWR, 48393172) and allowed to air dry in the dark for 60 min. To the dried cells was added ProLong Glass mounting agent (Invitrogen, P36982), a slide was placed on the coverslip and the slide was allowed to cure for 15 h prior to imaging. For samples stained sequentially with FM4-64fx (Invitrogen, F34653) before and PicoGreen, the protocol was as above except that after initial dilution and prior to fixation, 2.5 μL FM4-64fx (1,000 μg/mL in water) was added to 500 μL diluted culture to a final concentration of 5 μg/mL, incubated on ice for 1 min in the dark, and the fixation was performed as above except it was carried out in the dark. Staining with PicoGreen was then carried out as above. Images were acquired on a Leica SP8 STED with a 100 × /NA 1.40 oil immersion objective. The pinhole was set to 1 Airy Unit. PicoGreen was excited at 488 nm wavelength and STED was performed at 592 nm using 80% laser strength for depletion and filter range of 496-583 nm. Only confocal images were acquired (no STED) with FM4-64, which was excited at 514 nm and a filter range of 628–699 nm was used. We note that the axial resolution of confocal images, 750 nm, is greater than the diameter of an individual bacterium, 500 nm, preventing optical sectioning. A Z-projection of maximal intensity was assembled for each channel using ImageJ.
Cultures were grown with or without ciprofloxacin as described above. Either 4 mL (for cells at OD 600 = 0.5) or 2 mL (for cells grown an additional 8 h) were added without cooling to six-well plates (3.5 cm; Corning, 3516) containing poly-L-lysine-coated coverslips and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. For 4 mL samples, 2 mL media was removed. Next, 2 mL pre-warmed (55°C) fixation buffer (2.5% glutaraldehyde (v/v) in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2)) was added to each well and incubated 10 min at room temperature. The media was then replaced with 2 mL fixation buffer, and the cells incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Samples were rinsed three times with fixation buffer, dehydrated using a graded series of ethanol in 20% increments, ending with 100% ethanol, followed by three washes with 100% ethanol and then critical point dried with AutoSAMDRI-815 (Tousimis, USA) for 30 min. Coverslips were mounted on aluminum SEM stubs using double-sided carbon tape (8 mm; SPI, 05072-AB), grounded with colloidal silver paint, sputter coated with 12 nm gold-palladium (60:40; Ted Pella Inc., 91111), and imaged using secondary electron (SEI) mode using a Quanta 200 FEG MKII scanning electron microscope (ThermoFisher, USA).
Cultures were grown with or without ciprofloxacin as described above. Either 10 mL (for cells at OD 600 = 0.5) or 5 mL (for cells grown an additional 8 h) were added without cooling to six-well plates (3.5 cm; Corning, 3516) containing poly-L-lysine-coated coverslips and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. For 10 mL samples, 5 mL media was removed. Next, 5 mL pre-warmed (55°C) fixation buffer (2.5% glutaraldehyde (v/v) in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2). The media was then replaced with 2 mL fixation buffer, and the cells incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Samples were rinsed three times with fixation buffer, dehydrated using a graded series of ethanol in 20% increments, followed by three changes of 100% ethanol. Samples were infiltrated overnight with a 1:1 mixture of absolute ethanol and SPI-Pon 812 epoxy resin (SPI, 02660-AB). After five changes of fresh SPI-Pon 812 epoxy resin, each for 1 h at room temperature, samples were embedded in place in the wells in fresh epoxy resin for 48 h at 68°C. Epoxy wells were isolated with a jeweler’s saw and submerged in liquid nitrogen until the plastic bottom separated from the resin. Resin was trimmed and glued sample side up to a blank Pon 812 epoxy resin block and sectioned (~70 nm) with an ultramicrotome (Leica UC7, Germany) using a diamond knife. Sections were mounted on copper support grids and incubated sequentially with lead citrate (Reynold’s formulation) for 3 min at room temperature and uranyl acetate (4% (v/v) in 25% (v/v) ethanol) for 4 min at room temperature. Sections were examined at 100 kV using a Philips CM10 transmission electron microscopy (Field Electron and Ion Co., USA) equipped with a charge-coupled device camera (ES1000W Erlangshen, Gatan Inc., USA).
TtAgo was assembled with a 16 nt, synthetic single-stranded DNA guide corresponding to the first 16 nt of let-7a ( Table S1 ) and bearing a 3′ Alexa Fluor 555. Single-stranded DNA targets were generated as previously described ( Salomon et al., 2015 68. Salomon, W.E. ∙ Jolly, S.M. ∙ Moore, M.J. ... Single-Molecule Imaging Reveals that Argonaute Reshapes the Binding Properties of Its Nucleic Acid Guides Cell. 2015; 162 :84-95 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (194) PubMed Google Scholar ). In a typical labeling procedure, 100 pmol DNA target ( Table S1 ) was mixed with a 1.5-fold molar excess of Klenow template oligonucleotide ( Table S1 ) in 7.5 μL of 10 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 20 mM sodium chloride and 0.1 mM EDTA. Samples were incubated at 90°C for 5 min in a heat block. Then, the heat block was switched off and allowed to cool to room temperature. Afterward, the annealed strands (30% of final reaction volume) were added without further purification to a 3′ extension reaction, comprising 1 × NEB buffer 2 (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA), 1 mM dATP, 1 mM dCTP, 0.12 mM Alexa Fluor 647-aminohexylacrylamido-dUTP (Life Technologies), and 0.2 U/μl Klenow fragment (3′-to-5′ exo-minus, New England Biolabs) and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. The reaction was quenched with 500 mM (f.c.) ammonium acetate and 20 mM (f.c.) EDTA. A 15-fold molar excess of ‘trap’ oligonucleotide ( Table S1 ) was added to the Klenow template oligonucleotide. The entire reaction was precipitated overnight at ‒20°C with three volumes of ethanol. The labeled target was recovered by centrifugation, dried, dissolved in loading buffer (7 M Urea, 25 mM EDTA), and incubated at 95°C for 5 min. The samples were resolved on 6% polyacrylamide gel and isolated by electroelution.
Single-molecule experiments ( Friedman et al., 2006 16. Friedman, L.J. ∙ Chung, J. ∙ Gelles, J. Viewing dynamic assembly of molecular complexes by multi-wavelength single-molecule fluorescence Biophys. J. 2006; 91 :1023-1031 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (123) PubMed Google Scholar ) were performed and analyzed as described ( Smith et al., 2019 74. Smith, C.S. ∙ Jouravleva, K. ∙ Huisman, M. ... An automated Bayesian pipeline for rapid analysis of single-molecule binding data Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :272 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ). Fresh cover glasses were prepared for each day of imaging. Cover glasses (Gold Seal 24 Å~60 mm, No. 1.5, Cat. #3423), and glass coverslips (Gold Seal 25 Å~25 mm, No. 1, Cat. #3307) were cleaned by sonicating for 30 min in NanoStrip (KMG Chemicals, Houston, TX), were washed with 10 changes of deionized water and were dried with a stream of nitrogen. Two ~1 mm diameter lines of high vacuum grease (Dow Corning, Midland, MI) were applied to the cover glass to create a flow cell. Three layers of adhesive tape were applied outside of the flow cell. The coverslip was placed on top of the cover glass, with a ~0.3 mm gap between the cover glass and coverslip. To minimize non-specific binding of protein and DNA molecules to the glass surface, microfluidic chambers were incubated with 2 mg/mL poly-L-lysine-graft-PEG-biotin in 10 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4 at room temperature for 30 min and washed extensively with imaging buffer (30 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 120 mM potassium acetate, 3.5 mM magnesium acetate, 20% [w/v] glycerol) immediately before use. To allow immobilization of biotinylated DNA targets, streptavidin (0.01 mg/mL, Sigma) was incubated for 5 min in each microfluidic chamber. Unbound streptavidin was washed away with imaging buffer.
Immediately before each experiment, a flow cell was incubated with imaging buffer supplemented with 75 μg/mL heparin (Sigma H4784), oxygen scavenging system ( Crawford et al., 2008 9. Crawford, D.J. ∙ Hoskins, A.A. ∙ Friedman, L.J. ...

Then, it was filled with ~100 pM target in imaging buffer supplemented with 75 μg/mL heparin, oxygen scavenging system and triplet quenchers. Target deposition was monitored by taking a series of images; once the desired density was achieved, the flow cell was washed three times with imaging buffer supplemented with oxygen scavenging system and triplet quenchers. A syringe pump (KD Scientific, Holliston, MA) running in withdrawal mode at 0.15 mL/min was applied to the flow cell outlet to introduce TtAgo:guide complex (pre-heated to 55°C) supplemented with an oxygen scavenging system and triplet quenchers. Typically, 8,000 frames were collected at 67 frames per s. A digitally-controlled heater (TP-LH, Tokai Hit) maintained objective temperature at 42°C. A custom fabricated heating stage ( Smith et al., 2019 74. Smith, C.S. ∙ Jouravleva, K. ∙ Huisman, M. ... An automated Bayesian pipeline for rapid analysis of single-molecule binding data Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :272 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ) was heated to 65°C to achieve sample temperature of 55°C. Temperature on the surface of the cover glass was independently monitored with a Type E, 0.25 mm O.D. thermocouple (Omega Engineering Inc., Sutton, MA) inserted between the top and the bottom cover glasses.
Imaging was performed on an IX81-ZDC2 zero-drift inverted microscope equipped with a cellˆTIRF motorized multicolor TIRF illuminator with 561 and 640 nm 100 mW lasers and a 100 ×, oil immersion, 1.49 numerical aperture UAPO N TIRF objective with FN = 22 (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Fluorescence signals were split with a main dichroic mirror (Olympus OSF-LFQUAD) and triple emission filter (Olympus U-CZ491561639M). The primary image was relayed to two ImagEM X2 EM-CCD cameras (C9100-23B, Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan) using a Cairn three-way splitter equipped with a longpass dichroic mirror (T635lpxr-UF2, Chroma). Illumination and acquisition parameters were controlled with cellˆTIRF and MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA), respectively.
Images were recorded as uncompressed TIFF files and merged into stacked TIFF files. Images were processed using the pipeline ( Smith et al., 2019 74. Smith, C.S. ∙ Jouravleva, K. ∙ Huisman, M. ... An automated Bayesian pipeline for rapid analysis of single-molecule binding data Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :272 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ) as described in the manual. Co-localization events required that (1) the intensity of TtAgo:guide complex > 150 photons, (2) ratio intensity of the TtAgo:guide complex to the local background > 1, (3) the distance between the target and guide was < 1.2 pixel, and (4) sigma < 4.6. To exclude short, non-specific events, the minimal event duration was set to 5 frames. To overcome short temporary loss of TtAgo fluorescent signal due to blinking of the fluorescent dye, the gap parameter was set to 2 frames. Only the first binding event at each target location was used for estimation of arrival time and dwell time, in order to minimize errors caused by occupation of sites by photobleached molecules. The same analysis was automatically performed on ‘dark’ locations, i.e., regions that contained no target molecules; these served as a control for non-specific binding of TtAgo:guide complex to the surface of the cover glass. The individual experiments were saved, combined, and error evaluated by 1,000-cycle bootstrapping of 90% of the data.
Reactions (30 μL) were performed in final concentrations of 20 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.4, 125 mM potassium acetate, 0.01% (w/v) Igepal CA-630 (Sigma), 5 mM dithiothreitol and 100 nM 5′- 32 P-radiolabeled target and variable concentrations of manganese chloride, guide, TtAgo or TtAgo DM were added to complete the reaction. The mixture was heated at 65°C. Aliquots (7 μL) were removed at 0, 1 and 16 h, quenched into 100 μL Proteinase K buffer (200 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 25 mM EDTA, 2% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate) and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen then stored at –20°C. Aliquots were thawed, 100 μL Proteinase K (0.2 mg/mL f.c.) in Proteinase K buffer was added and the mixture was heated at 50°C for 1 h. The reaction was extracted with 1 volume of 24:25:1 phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (pH 8.0) and precipitated with ethanol. The samples were taken up in 25 μL formamide loading buffer (98% (w/v) deionized formamide, 10 mM EDTA (pH 8.0), 0.025% (w/v) xylene cyanol, 0.025% (w/v) bromophenol blue), heated at 95°C for 5 min and then resolved by electrophoresis through a denaturing 15% polyacrylamide gel. The dried gel was imaged using a Typhoon FLA 7000IR phosphorimager (GE Healthcare).
Targets were identical to those described by Swarts et al. (2017) 78. Swarts, D.C. ∙ Szczepaniak, M. ∙ Sheng, G. ... Autonomous Generation and Loading of DNA Guides by Bacterial Argonaute Mol. Cell. 2017; 65 :985-998.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar . Oligonucleotides were 5′ radiolabeled with γ- 32 P-ATP (Perkin Elmer, NEG035C005MC) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (NEB, M201) following the manufacturer′s instructions. Free ATP was removed using a MicroSpin G-25 column (GE Healthcare), and the oligonucleotides were further purified by denaturing 7.5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The 98 bp radiolabeled double-strand DNA substrates were prepared using PCR amplification of a 98 nt ssDNA template with a 5′-radiolabeled primer (prepared as above) and an unlabeled primer to achieve a substrate with the radiolabel incorporated on the strand complementary to the ssDNA guide. PCR was performed using Phusion polymerase (NEB, M0530), desalted (QIAGEN, 28106), then purified by native 7.5% (29:1 acrylamide:bis-acrylamide) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. DNA was recovered by incubating the gel slice in 0.3 M sodium chloride for 16 h at 25°C, and then concentrated by ethanol precipitation. Cleavage assays were as described ( Swarts et al., 2017 78. Swarts, D.C. ∙ Szczepaniak, M. ∙ Sheng, G. ... Autonomous Generation and Loading of DNA Guides by Bacterial Argonaute Mol. Cell. 2017; 65 :985-998.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, target substrates (20 nM ssDNA or 8 nM dsDNA) were incubated with TtAgo (50 nM) with or without ssDNA guide (60 nM) in 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.5 mM manganese chloride , 250 mM sodium chloride for 16 h at 65°C. Reactions were stopped by adding 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM sodium chloride, 12.5 mM 2,2′,2″,2″′-(ethane-1,2-diyldinitrilo)tetraacetic acid, 1% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate, 200 ng/μL Proteinase K) and incubating at 65°C for 30 min, extracted with 25:24:1 phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (pH 8.0), precipitated with ethanol, and resolved by denaturing 7.5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and imaged using a Typhoon FLA 7000IR phosphorimager (GE Healthcare). Decade marker (Invitrogen, AM7778) labeled with γ- 32 P-ATP was used as size standards.
Immunoprecipitation of TtAgo from lysate prepared by sonication using antibody covalently crosslinked to the beads was as described above except that after incubation with lysate, the antibody-beads were washed once with lysis buffer and then were re-suspended in 100 μL Turbo DNase buffer and 4U (2 μL) Turbo DNase (Ambion AM2238) and incubated at 37°C for 30 min. Water was used instead of DNase in the control incubation. Beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and eluted with 25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM sodium chloride, 1% (w/v) Igepal CA-630, 1% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 2% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate, 1 mM dithiothreitol at 95°C for 5 min. Immunoprecipitates were reduced with dithiothreitol (30 μL 0.2 M per 5 mg sample) for 1 h at 55°C, alkylated with iodoacetamide (30 μL 0.5 M per 5 mg sample) for 45 min in the dark at room temperature. Each sample was loaded onto S-Trap microcolumns (Protifi, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 3 μL of 12% phosphoric acid and 165 μL of binding buffer (90% methanol, 100 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate [TEAB]) were added to each sample. Samples were loaded onto spin columns and centrifuged at 4,000 × g for 30 s. After three washes with binding buffer, 20 μL containing 500 ng of trypsin in 50 mM TEAB was added to the microcolumn and incubated at 47°C for 1 h. Peptides were eluted using 40% acetonitrile in 0.5% acetic acid, followed by 80% acetonitrile in 0.5% acetic acid, and concentrated in a SpeedVac.
Each sample (1 μg) was loaded onto a 75 μm × 2 cm, C18, 3 μm, 100 Å PepMap 100 pre-column (Acclaim, Thermo Scientific) in series with a 50 m × 75 μm ID, 2 μm, 100 Å PepMap RSLC C18 EASY-Spray column analytical column (ThermoFisher Scientific) using the autosampler of an Easy nLC 1000 (Thermo Scientific). Peptides were eluted into the Orbitrap QExactive HF-X mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific) using a 5.9%–22.28% gradient of acetonitrile in 0.5% acetic acid in 120 min, a 22.28%–33.2% gradient of acetonitrile in 0.5% acetic acid in 20 min, and finally a 33.2–80 gradient of acetonitrile in 0.5% acetic acid in 10 min. The full scan was acquired with a resolution of 60,000 (at m / z 200), a target value of 3 × 10 6 and a maximum ion time of 45 ms. Following each full MS scan, twenty data-dependent MS/MS spectra were acquired. The MS/MS spectra were collected with a resolution of 15,000, an AGC target of 1 × 10 5 , a maximum ion time of 120 ms, one microscan, 2 m/z isolation window, fixed first mass of 150 m/z, dynamic exclusion of 30 s, and Normalized Collision Energy (NCE) = 27.
For small DNAs, sequences were filtered (Phred quality score ≥ 20 for all nucleotides), and the 3′ adaptor sequence (5′-TGGAATTCTCGGGTGCCAAGG-3′) removed. Sequences of spike-in synthetic DNAs were identified allowing no mismatches. Sequences of small DNAs ≥ 14 nt in length were aligned onto our de novo genome assembly allowing no mismatches. For multiply mapping sequences, the number of read was divided by the number of locations to which the small DNA mapped (i.e., multi-mapping reads were apportioned). For origin and terminus mapping, PCR duplicates were removed using unique molecular identifiers ( Fu et al., 2018 17. Fu, Y. ∙ Wu, P.H. ∙ Beane, T. ... Elimination of PCR duplicates in RNA-seq and small RNA-seq using unique molecular identifiers BMC Genomics. 2018; 19 :531 Crossref Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ), and total coverage per 1,000 bp for the chromosome was determined for each growth phase. The ratio of logarithmic:stationary phases of identical windows was calculated and Loess smoothed using Igor Pro 8 (WaveMetrics, USA) using a smoothing factor = 0.5 and a quadratic regression order (i.e., order = 2).
Bacterial lengths were measured in ImageJ, counting only bacteria with distinct boundaries. Data was log-transformed and subject to a test of normality (Shapiro-Wilk test) and a test of homoscedasticity (Levene’s test) before proceeding to two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to test for significant independent and interacting effects of genotype and ciprofloxacin treatment, followed by post hoc testing with Tukey’s honestly significant difference test for pairwise comparisons.
After RNase treatment and immediately before size selection, an equimolar mix of six DNA oligonucleotides (Table S1) was added to the DNA co-immunoprecipitated with TtAgo. The number of small DNA molecules per cell was determined relative to the number of reads of the spike-in oligonucleotides. The number of cells was determined by OD 600 of the cultures used to prepare the lysate used for immunoprecipitation (OD 600 1.0 = 6.0 × 10 8 cells/mL). Molecules per cell were calculated.: 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑠 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑟 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑙 = ( 𝑔 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑒 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑔 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑠 ) × ( 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑘 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑠 ) × ( 6 . 0 2 2 × 1 0 2 3 ) ÷ ( [ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑘 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑠 ] × [ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑠 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑦 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑒 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑑 𝑓 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑟 𝐼 ⁢ 𝑃 ] )
To determine the number of molecules of TtAgo per cell, recombinant TtAgo standards, (13, 26, 39, 52 and 78 fmoles as determined by amino acid analysis) were used to determine the amount of TtAgo in lysate from 2–2.4 × 10 8 cells (n = 3) were loaded into the same SDS-PAGE gel, immunoblotted and imaged as detailed above for western blotting. Molecules per cell were determined for TtAgo present in lysates using a standard curve base on the recombinant TtAgo concentration standards and number of cells loaded on the gel.
Following short read genomic sequencing for competitive growth assay as described above, reads that did not align to the T. thermophilus genome were aligned against 13 complete genomes of phages known to infect Thermus communities ( Lopatina et al., 2019 48. Lopatina, A. ∙ Medvedeva, S. ∙ Artamonova, D. ... Natural diversity of CRISPR spacers of Thermus: evidence of local spacer acquisition and global spacer exchange Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2019; 374 :20180092 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ). The number of phage genomes per cell was calculated using the ratio of coverage densities of phage and htk (kanamycin resistance gene) mapping reads and the fact that an average T. thermophilus cell contains 6–7 genomes ( Li, 2019 45. Li, H. Random Chromosome Partitioning in the Polyploid Bacterium Thermus thermophilus HB27 G3 (Bethesda). 2019; 9 :1249-1261 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The GC content of the Thermus thermophilus genome, the 38.5 kb region encompassing the terminus, and randomly selected 38.5 kb genomic regions was calculated using a 16-nt sliding window (16 nt is the modal length of TtAgo-bound DNA guides). DNA duplex stability at 65°C (Δ G° ) was estimated with RNAduplex (ViennaRNA package v2.1.6h) using the DNA nearest-neighbor parameters.
MS/MS spectra were searched against the T. thermophilus reference proteome using Andromeda ( Cox et al., 2011 8. Cox, J. ∙ Neuhauser, N. ∙ Michalski, A. ... Andromeda: a peptide search engine integrated into the MaxQuant environment J. Proteome Res. 2011; 10 :1794-1805 Crossref Scopus (4049) PubMed Google Scholar ). Protein quantification between samples was performed using the summed eXtracted Ion Current (XIC) of all isotopic clusters within MaxQuant 1.5.2.8 ( Cox et al., 2011 8. Cox, J. ∙ Neuhauser, N. ∙ Michalski, A. ... Andromeda: a peptide search engine integrated into the MaxQuant environment J. Proteome Res. 2011; 10 :1794-1805 Crossref Scopus (4049) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mass tolerance was set to 10 ppm for MS1 and MS2 searches. False discovery rate (FDR) filtration was performed first on the peptide level and then on the protein level. Both filtrations were done at 1% FDR using a standard target-decoy database approach. Proteins identified with less than two unique peptides were excluded from analysis. Bioinformatics analysis was performed with Perseus and Microsoft Excel. Benjamini-Hochberg corrected Student’s t test was used to calculate FDR to identify proteins specifically associated with TtAgo.
Statistical tests are described in the figure legends.
