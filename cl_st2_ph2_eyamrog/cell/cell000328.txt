Title: RNA polymerase III is required for the repair of DNA double-strand breaks by homologous recombination


Abstract: Summary

End resection in homologous recombination (HR) and HR-mediated repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) removes several kilobases from 5′ strands of DSBs, but 3′ strands are exempted from degradation. The mechanism by which the 3′ overhangs are protected has not been determined. Here, we established that the protection of 3′ overhangs is achieved through the transient formation of RNA-DNA hybrids. The DNA strand in the hybrids is the 3′ ssDNA overhang, while the RNA strand is newly synthesized. RNA polymerase III (RNAPIII) is responsible for synthesizing the RNA strand. Furthermore, RNAPIII is actively recruited to DSBs by the MRN complex. CtIP and MRN nuclease activity is required for initiating the RNAPIII-mediated RNA synthesis at DSBs. A reduced level of RNAPIII suppressed HR, and genetic loss > 30 bp increased at DSBs. Thus, RNAPIII is an essential HR factor, and the RNA-DNA hybrid is an essential repair intermediate for protecting the 3′ overhangs in DSB repair.

Section: Introduction

HR predominantly occurs in the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle, as sister chromatids in these phases are available to serve as repair templates. The process of HR and the HR-mediated repair of DSBs consist of three main steps, namely, end resection, strand invasion, and resolution of Holliday junctions ( Haber et al., 2004 12.

At the end-resection step, several hundred to several thousand bases are removed from the 5′-ended strand, which generates a 3′ single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) overhang of hundreds to thousands of nucleotides. This 3′ ssDNA overhang then invades a sister chromatid or a neighboring complementary DNA molecule for subsequent HR processes ( Daley et al., 2015 9. Daley, J.M. ∙ Niu, H. ∙ Miller, A.S. ...

The nucleases that directly participate in end resection are the CtIP-MRN (MRE11, RAD50, and NBS1) complex, DNA2 flap endonuclease, and EXO1 dsDNA exonuclease, as we know at present ( Cannavo and Cejka, 2014 6.

The MRN complex (MRX in budding yeast, MRE11-RAD50-XRS2) has both endonuclease and 3′-5′ exonuclease activities ( Deshpande et al., 2016 10. Deshpande, R.A. ∙ Lee, J.H. ∙ Arora, S. ...

The 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity of Mre 11 facilitates repair of DNA double-strand breaks Mol. Cell. 1998; 1 :969-979 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (734) PubMed Google Scholar ). The initiation of end resection is carried out by the CtIP-MRN (or SAE2-MRX in budding yeast) complex, which removes approximately a few dozen nucleotides from the 5′-strand end ( Cannavo and Cejka, 2014 6. Cannavo, E. ∙ Cejka, P. Sae2 promotes dsDNA endonuclease activity within Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 to resect DNA breaks Nature. 2014; 514 :122-125 Crossref Scopus (319) PubMed Google Scholar ). Besides these nuclease s, Sgs1 helicase in budding yeast is also involved in the resection process, because Sgs1 and Dna2 form a complex in budding yeast, and it is demonstrated that Sgs1 is responsible for unwinding the DNA to generate flap structures for Dna2 cleavage ( Cejka et al., 2010 7.

In contrast to Sgs1 in budding yeast, Rqh1, the homolog of Sgs1 in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe , plays only a minor role in end resection, although it was also reported that, in a specific situation, Rqh1 functions for long-range end resection in the absence of Crb2 and Rev7 ( Leland et al., 2018 18. Leland, B.A. ∙ Chen, A.C. ∙ Zhao, A.Y. ... Rev7 and 53BP1/Crb2 prevent RecQ helicase-dependent hyper-resection of DNA double-strand breaks eLife. 2018; 7 :e33402 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that end resection up to 9.4 kb is not much affected in the rqh1 Δ cells ( Zhang et al., 2016 52. Zhang, H. ∙ Hua, Y. ∙ Li, R. ... Cdc24 Is Essential for Long-range End Resection in the Repair of Double-stranded DNA Breaks J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291 :24961-24973 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ), which is consistent with a previous study ( Langerak et al., 2011 17. Langerak, P. ∙ Mejia-Ramirez, E. ∙ Limbo, O. ... Release of Ku and MRN from DNA ends by Mre11 nuclease activity and Ctp1 is required for homologous recombination repair of double-strand breaks PLoS Genet. 2011; 7 :e1002271 Crossref Scopus (184) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, as in budding yeast, Dna2 and Exo1 are required for end resection in S. pombe ( Zhang et al., 2016 52. Zhang, H. ∙ Hua, Y. ∙ Li, R. ... Cdc24 Is Essential for Long-range End Resection in the Repair of Double-stranded DNA Breaks J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291 :24961-24973 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ). Since S. pombe Dna2 has only a modest helicase activity ( Hu et al., 2012 14. Hu, J. ∙ Sun, L. ∙ Shen, F. ... The intra-S phase checkpoint targets Dna2 to prevent stalled replication forks from reversing Cell. 2012; 149 :1221-1232 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (130) PubMed Google Scholar ), this raises the question of how flap structures, a preferred Dna2 substrate, are generated for end resection in fission yeast. It is possible that S. pombe cells may use another helicase for generating flap structures. It is equally possible that another mechanism exists in fission yeast cells to create flap structures. In metazoan or human cells, both in vitro and in vivo assays show that DNA2 and EXO1 are involved in long-range end resection at DSBs ( Nimonkar et al., 2011 28. Nimonkar, A.V. ∙ Genschel, J. ∙ Kinoshita, E. ... BLM-DNA2-RPA-MRN and EXO1-BLM-RPA-MRN constitute two DNA end resection machineries for human DNA break repair Genes Dev. 2011; 25 :350-362 Crossref Scopus (556) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sturzenegger et al., 2014 45. Sturzenegger, A. ∙ Burdova, K. ∙ Kanagaraj, R. ... DNA2 cooperates with the WRN and BLM RecQ helicases to mediate long-range DNA end resection in human cells J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289 :27314-27326 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (154) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the helicase that functions in end resection remains a matter of debate. There are five homologs of Sgs1 helicase—WRN, RECQ4, BLM, RECQL, and RECQ5β ( Hickson, 2003 13. Hickson, I.D. RecQ helicases: caretakers of the genome Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3 :169-178 Crossref Scopus (584) PubMed Google Scholar ). Studies in Xenopus egg extracts showed that Dna2 together with WRN rather than BLM mediates DNA end resection ( Liao et al., 2008 20. Liao, S. ∙ Toczylowski, T. ∙ Yan, H. Identification of the Xenopus DNA2 protein as a major nuclease for the 5′->3′ strand-specific processing of DNA ends Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36 :6091-6100 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yan et al., 2005 51. Yan, H. ∙ McCane, J. ∙ Toczylowski, T. ... Analysis of the Xenopus Werner syndrome protein in DNA double-strand break repair J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171 :217-227 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, an in vitro biochemical analysis suggested that BLM, together with DNA2 and EXO1, constitutes two DNA end-resection machineries for DSB repair in human cells ( Nimonkar et al., 2011 28. Nimonkar, A.V. ∙ Genschel, J. ∙ Kinoshita, E. ... BLM-DNA2-RPA-MRN and EXO1-BLM-RPA-MRN constitute two DNA end resection machineries for human DNA break repair Genes Dev. 2011; 25 :350-362 Crossref Scopus (556) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, the discrepancies in the functional assays of WRN and BLM indicate that the question of whether WRN or BLM function for end resection in vivo remains open.
After end resection on the 5′ strands, 3′-ssDNA overhangs are created at DSBs. RAD51 assembles onto the 3′-ssDNA overhang to form a RAD51 nucleoprotein filament. This filament then invades a homologous sequence for subsequent HR or DSB repair processes ( San Filippo et al., 2008 40. San Filippo, J. ∙ Sung, P. ∙ Klein, H. Mechanism of eukaryotic homologous recombination Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77 :229-257 Crossref Scopus (1267) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although much is known about the process of end resection, some critical questions still remain to be answered. Among them, the most important one is how the integrity of the 3′-ssDNA overhang is preserved during end resection. A strict protection of the 3′-ssDNA overhang is critical during the extensive resection of the 5′-ended strand(s), as an entire or even a partial removal of the 3′-ssDNA overhang will inhibit HR and potentially results in genetic loss.
Three recent studies reported the observation of RNA-DNA hybrids at DSBs ( Li et al., 2016 19. Li, L. ∙ Germain, D.R. ∙ Poon, H.Y. ...

Small RNA molecules complementary to the neighboring DNA sequences of DSBs have also been detected ( Francia et al., 2012 11. Francia, S. ∙ Michelini, F. ∙ Saxena, A. ...

Furthermore, it has also been reported that DDX1 RNA helicase, as well as RNase H1/2 and noncoding RNA (ncRNA)-processing RNases, are required for efficient DSB repair by HR and may be involved in removing the RNA strands at DSBs ( Francia et al., 2012 11.

Wei, W. ∙ Ba, Z. ∙ Gao, M. ... A role for small RNAs in DNA double-strand break repair Cell. 2012; 149 :101-112 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (481) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, regarding the RNA-DNA hybrids at DSBs, several critical questions remain, as remarked by Aguilera and Gómez-Gonzalez (2017) 1. Aguilera, A. ∙ Gómez-González, B. DNA-RNA hybrids: the risks of DNA breakage during transcription Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2017; 24 :439-443 Crossref Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar and Plosky (2016) 36. Plosky, B.S. The Good and Bad of RNA:DNA Hybrids in Double-Strand Break Repair Mol. Cell. 2016; 64 :643-644 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (5) PubMed Google Scholar . First, is the RNA strand at DSB just a transcript at actively transcribed region where DSB happens to occur? Second, is the RNA-DNA hybrid a repair intermediate? Third, if the RNA-DNA hybrid at DSB is actively created, which RNA polymerase is responsible for catalyzing the RNA strand synthesis? Fourth, what is the biological function of the RNA-DNA hybrids in the repair of DSBs?
In this study, we found that RNA polymerase III (RNAPIII) is an essential factor in the HR-mediated repair of DSBs. Moreover, we showed that the formation of RNA-DNA hybrids is an active process and the RNA-DNA hybrid is a repair intermediate in the process of HR and the HR-mediated repair of DSBs. The RNA strand in the hybrids is catalyzed by RNAPIII, and the DNA strand is the 3′-ssDNA overhang. The formation of RNA-DNA hybrids is one of the earliest events in the HR-mediated repair of DSBs. When the formation of the RNA-DNA hybrid was inhibited by either the RNAi-mediated reduction of RNAPIII or a specific chemical inhibitor, it significantly decreased the rate of HR and caused the genetic loss at DSBs, suggesting that the formation of RNA-DNA hybrids protects the 3′-ssDNA overhangs. We further demonstrated that the RNAPIII-mediated RNA synthesis plays an important role in long-range end resection, suggesting that at least some of the flap structures or the displacement of the 5′-strand results from the RNA synthesis. Furthermore, it was found that RNAPIII is actively recruited to DSBs by the MRN complex.

Section: Results

To further understand the mechanism of HR and HR-mediated DSB repair, we undertook the search for additional HR factors. 293T cells were treated with 5 μM VP-16 (etoposide) for 3 h. Chromatin was isolated and treated with Benzonase nuclease. The chromatin fractions containing broken DNA ends and the proteins associated with them were immunoprecipitated with the antibody against MRE11, a subunit of the MRN complex. The analysis of the brought-down proteins by mass spectrometry detected, besides the known HR factors, some subunits of RNA polymerases, such as RPAC1, RPABC1 and 4, and RPC4 ( Table S1 ). In eukaryotes, except in plants, there are three RNA polymerases, namely, RNA polymerase I, II, and III (RNAPI, II, III), which are responsible for the transcription of rRNA, mRNA, tRNA, and some small RNAs, respectively ( Cramer et al., 2008 8. Cramer, P. ∙ Armache, K.J. ∙ Baumli, S. ... Structure of eukaryotic RNA polymerases Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2008; 37 :337-352 Crossref Scopus (235) PubMed Google Scholar ). For RNAPI, II, or III, some subunits are commonly used ( Cramer et al., 2008 8. Cramer, P. ∙ Armache, K.J. ∙ Baumli, S. ... Structure of eukaryotic RNA polymerases Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2008; 37 :337-352 Crossref Scopus (235) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Table S2 ). For instance, RPABC4 is the smallest subunits of RNAPII (RPB) and is also shared by the other two DNA-directed RNA polymerases-RNAPI (RPA) and III (RPC). RPAC1 is the largest common subunit used by RNAPI and III, while RPC4 is RNAPIII-specific subunit. To determine whether an RNA polymerase(s) indeed localizes to DSBs, fluorescence assays were conducted. First, RPAC1, RPABC4, and RPC4 subunits detected by MRN immunoprecipitation (IP) were examined. The EGFP-tagged RPAC1, RPABC4, and RPC4 were individually expressed in U2OS cells. As shown in Figure 1 A, the EGFP-tagged subunits RPABC4, RPAC1, and RPC4 were localized to DSBs, and their fluorescence signals clearly overlapped with γH2AX (H2AX phosphorylated on serine 139). This result confirms that RPABC4, RPAC1, and RPC4 are indeed localized to DSBs. This result also suggests that an RNA polymerase may actively localize to DSBs. To determine whether all three RNA polymerases or only one of them is localized to DSBs, the presence of RPA1, RPB1, and RPC1 (the catalytic subunit of RNAPI, II, and III, respectively) at DSBs was examined. The results revealed, as shown in Figure 1 B, that RPC1 localized to DSBs, whereas RPA1 and RPB1 did not. The fluorescence assays in real time also indicated that RPC3, 4, 6, and 7 subunits of RNAPIII localized to DSBs ( Figure 1 C). Additionally, RPABC1 and 4 (the subunits shared by RNAPI, II, and III) were localized to DSBs, but RPB3 (a subunit belonging to only RNAPII) did not ( Figures S1 A and S1B). These results suggest that only RNAPIII localizes to DSBs. Furthermore, the RPC1 immuno-staining signal was detected during the first minute after DNA breaks and quickly rose to a maximum level at around the fifth minute ( Figure 1 D). As shown in Figure 1 C, in living cells, EGFP-tagged RPC3, 4, 6, and 7 localized to DSBs within the first minute after laser irradiation. In Figure S1 C, more living cells showed the localization of RPC3, 4, 6, and 7 to DSBs in real time. The statistics shown in Figure S1 C indicate the relative increase of EGFP-RPC3 or -RPC6 fluorescence at laser stripe over time and the ratio of examined cells showing RPC3, 4, 6, and 7 localized to DSBs. Taken together, these results suggest that RNAPIII is localized to DSBs, and it occurs during the very early stage of the DSB repair process. Using a similar assay, NBS1 (a subunit of MRN) and RPA32 (a subunit of RPA) were found at DSBs within the first minute after irradiation ( Figures S1 D and S1E). We also found that the chromatin level of the RNAPIII-specific subunit RPC7 remarkably increases in cells treated with the DSB-inducing agent Camptothecin (CPT) or etoposide (VP-16), as shown in Figure 1 E, which further supports that RNAPIII localizes to DSBs. Additionally, using a single clean I-SceI-generated DSB site, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR analysis further confirmed that RNAPIII localizes to DSBs. The construction of a 3FLAG-tagged RPC3 cell line using the CRISPR-Cas9 technique is shown in the schematic in Figure 1 F. Three independent homozygous cell lines were obtained, and they showed similar growth rate compared to wild-type (WT) cells (data not shown). An IP assay showed the interaction of 3FLAG-RPC3 and RPC7, and a ChIP assay demonstrated the enrichment of 3FLAG-RPC3 in the 5S RNA and tRNA Tyr genomic regions in which RNAP III catalyzes transcription ( Figure 1 G). These results indicated that 3FLAG-RPC3 is able to integrate into the RNAPIII complex. The results in Figure 1 H reveal that RNAPIII (RPC3) was enriched at the I-SceI break site. However, RNAPI (RPA1) and II (RPB1) were not enriched at the I-SceI break site, as indicated by the lack of statistically significant difference between the association of RPA1 or RPB1 with the I-SceI site before and after DNA break ( Figure 1 H). Additionally, the results in Figure 1 H also indicate that a certain amount of RNAPII (RPB1 subunit) may exist near the I-SceI break site, which is consistent with the ubiquitous presence of RNAPII on chromatin, as required for mRNA transcription. The enrichment of RPC3 at AsisI break sites located in non-transcription regions (compacted chromatin) was also detected ( Figure 1 I). These results indicate that RNAPIII localizes to DSBs in both euchromatin and heterochromatin regions. Immunostaining analysis of γ-H2AX, Cyclin A2, and RPC1 in laser micro-irradiated cells revealed, as shown in Figure 1 J, that RPC1 signal co-localized with γH2AX signal in both cyclin A2 (S/G2-phase-specific cyclin)-positive and -negative cells. This suggests that RNAPIII is recruited to DSBs in cells at the G1, S, and G2 phases. Taken together, these results indicate that RNAPIII, but not RNAPI and II, localizes to DSBs independent of the cell-cycle phase.
Considering that RNAPIII localizes to DSBs, it is reasonable to anticipate that the biochemical function of RNAIII at DSBs is to catalyze RNA synthesis. Using the uracil analog 5-ethynyl uridine (5-EU) incorporation assay, newly synthesized RNAs were detected at the laser micro-irradiated stripe, which is co-localized with γH2AX ( Figures 2 A and S2 A). We refer to this newly synthesized RNA as DSB-RNA (DNA double-strand break RNA). To determine whether the DSB-RNA is associated with a complementary DNA strand to form RNA-DNA hybrids, a fluorescence assay was performed using S9.6 antibody, a monoclonal antibody that specifically recognizes RNA-DNA hybrids ( Boguslawski et al., 1986 5. Boguslawski, S.J. ∙ Smith, D.E. ∙ Michalak, M.A. ... Characterization of monoclonal antibody to DNA.RNA and its application to immunodetection of hybrids J. Immunol. Methods. 1986; 89 :123-130 Crossref Scopus (321) PubMed Google Scholar ). The result in Figure 2 B shows that RNA-DNA hybrids were formed at DSBs, and their signal clearly overlaps with γH2AX ( Figure 2 B). The formation of RNA-DNA hybrids was further examined in living cells in real-time mode, using an EGFP-HB-NLS fusion protein to recognize and detect RNA-DNA hybrids. Adding a nuclear localization signal (NLS) to EGFP-HB (a RNase H1-derived RNA-DNA hybrids binding domain fused to EGFP) remarkably increases the localization of EGFP-HB in the nucleus and considerably enhances the resolution of its fluorescence signal, compared with the only HB domain reported previously ( Bhatia et al., 2014 4. Bhatia, V. ∙ Barroso, S.I. ∙ García-Rubio, M.L. ... BRCA2 prevents R-loop accumulation and associates with TREX-2 mRNA export factor PCID2 Nature. 2014; 511 :362-365 Crossref Scopus (395) PubMed Google Scholar ). As shown in Figure 2 C, a strong EGFP-HB signal appeared at the laser micro-irradiated stripe during the first minute after the DNA breaks, but the signal decreased to the lowest level at around the third or fifth minute. Afterward, the EGFP-HB signal increased again, and its extent was apparently stronger at the 10 th , 20 th , or 30 th minute, compared to the signal at the third to fifth minute. The formation of RNA-DNA hybrids at DSBs was also examined with cells overexpressing RNase H. As shown in Figure S2 B, the EGFP-HB signal appeared at laser stripes in normal S/G2 cells (expressing cyclin A2, but RNH1 not overexpressed). However, when RNH1 was overexpressed, the ratio of the S/G2 cells showing EGFP-HB signal significantly decreased, and the intensity of fluorescent signal at laser stripe also became much weaker, indicating again that RNA synthesis at DSBs takes place.
The formation of RNA-DNA hybrids at DSBs was further examined at a single DNA break site generated by cutting with I-SceI. A cell line harboring a single I-SceI endonuclease site was created by engineering an I-SceI recognition site in the second intron region of the GAPDH gene and named as GAPDH-I-SceI cell line. Fifteen hours after transfecting the GAPDH-I-SceI cells with plasmids expressing I-SceI, genomic DNA was prepared and subsequently sonicated to an average size of ~500 bp. Then, DNA-RNA hybrids were captured by the recombinant 3FLAG-HB protein affinity column before and after RNase H treatment. The captured RNA-DNA hybrids were quantified by qPCR. As shown in Figure 2 D (left panel), the results reveal that the amounts of DNA captured by 3FLAG-HB-beads increased by approximately 4- to 6-fold at DNA break regions (50 or 800 bp away from the I-SceI site) compared with that captured by anti-FLAG-IgG control beads. However, this increase disappeared when the genomic DNA was treated by RNase H prior to the 3FLAG-HB affinity chromatography ( Figure 2 D). As a control, the highly transcribed genomic DNA regions encoding 5S RNA and tRNA Tyr were also enriched by 5- to 6-fold, but the enrichment also vanished when the genomic DNA was previously treated by RNase H ( Figure 2 D, right panel), validating the current method of using 3FLAG-HB for capturing RNA-DNA hybrids. Thus, at the clean I-SceI-generated DNA break site, RNA-DNA hybrids are also formed. Consistent with RNAPIII localized to DSBs in compacted chromatin regions ( Figure 1 I), the RNA-DNA hybrids were also formed at those AsisI break sites ( Figure 2 E).
To determine which DNA strand, the 3′- or 5′-ended strand at DSBs, is used for the formation of the RNA-DNA hybrids at DSBs, an assay, depicted in Figure 2 F, was performed. The RNA-DNA hybrid(s) formed at the I-SceI break site were isolated by 3FLAG-HB affinity chromatography as shown in Figure 2 D. The isolated RNA-DNA hybrids were then digested with duplex-specific nuclease (DSN) and DNase I to remove the DNA strand. The remaining RNA strand was subjected to one round of reverse transcription in a single direction with either forward primers (hypothesis I: the RNA strand was transcribed using the 3′-ended DNA strand at DSBs) or reverse primers (hypothesis II: the RNA strand was transcribed using the 5′-ended DNA strand at DSBs). After reverse transcription, the reverse transcriptase was inactivated by heat; the RNA strand was removed by RNase H digestion. Finally, PCRs were performed to analyze the reverse transcription products. As shown in Figure 2 G, the forward primers (hypothesis I) generated strong DNA signals, but the reverse primers (hypothesis II) did not. This result indicates that the RNA strand in the RNA-DNA hybrids at DSBs is transcribed using the 3′-ended DNA strand. Additionally, this result is also consistent with the finding that the 5′-ended DNA strand is degraded during end resection by Exo1 and Dna2, while the 3′-ended strand remains intact. Since the R1 primer is located 35 nt away from the I-SceI site, a PCR product resulting from the R1 and F1 primers indicates that the RNA strand in the RNA-DNA hybrids is transcribed from the beginning of the very end of the 3′-ended ssDNA strand.
To determine whether the formation of RNA-DNA hybrids is specifically related to the cell-cycle phase, the U2OS cells stably expressing EGFP-HB-NLS were first arrested at the G1/S phase by double-thymidine treatment and then released to S and G2 phase (6 and 10 h after G1/S release). For cells at the G1 phase, the U2OS cells were arrested at G2/M phase in the presence of nocodazole and then released to G1 phase (4 h after G2/M-phase release) ( Figure 3 A). These cells were subjected to laser micro-irradiation, and the fluorescence signals of EGFP-HB-NLS were recorded in real time in living cells. As shown in Figure 3 B, the EGFP-HB-NLS signal in the cells at the G1 phase appeared within the first min, and then it quickly decreased and became hardly detectable at the fifth minute and beyond. For the cells at the S and G2 phases, the EGFP-HB-NLS signal also appeared during the first minute and then decreased to a hardly detectable level at the third and fifth minute, which is just like the cells at the G1 phase. However, as in Figure 2 C, a second EGFP-HB-NLS signal appeared after the fifth minute and was detectable at the examined 10 th , 20 th , and 30 th min ( Figure 3 B). This second EGFP-HB-NLS signal could last for more than 40 min and was designated as the long-term HB signal (LT-HB) ( Figure 3 C), while the first EGFP-HB-NLS was designated as short-term HB signal (ST-HB) ( Figure 3 C). To see the two EGFP-HB-NLS signals clearly, the fluorescent images taken, respectively, at the first and 30 th minute in Figure 3 B are enlarged and presented in Figure S3 A. Compared to ST-HB, LT-HB is relatively weaker ( Figures 3 B–3D). The percentage of cells showing ST-HB and LT-HB signals at G1, S, or G2 phase is presented in Figure 3 E. The LT-HB signal was also detected in a small percentage of cells assumed to be at the G1 phase ( Figure 1 E), which may be due to the release of some cells from cell-cycle synchronization. The dynamics of ST-HB and LT-HB signals is shown with a movie ( Videos S1 and S2 ).

The real-time fluorescent signal of EGFP-HB-NLS at DSBs in cells at the G2 phase, related to Figure 3
To evaluate the biochemical properties of the two HB signals—the ST-HB and LT-HB at DSBs, we first examined the RNA synthesis at laser-irradiated stripe based on 5-EU incorporation in the cells at different phases. The results revealed that the RNA synthesis at laser-irradiated stripes occurred only in cells at the S/G2 phase that show the presence of cyclin A2 ( Figure 3 F). The RNA synthesis was not detected in cells at the G1 phase ( Figure 3 F). Using an EGFP-HB-NLS fusion protein to detect RNA-DNA hybrids at laser-irradiated stripes, the ST-HB signal was detected in both G1 and S/G2 cells at the first minute after laser irradiation, but the LT-HB was detected only in the S/G2 cells when the images were taken at the 30 th minute ( Figure 3 G). The ratio of cells showing the ST-HB or LT-HB signal is presented in the right panels of Figures 3 F or 3G, respectively. A small percentage of cells, which were assumed to be cyclin A – cells, also showed the LT-HB signal at laser stripe ( Figure 3 G, right). The reason for that may be due to that these cells were actually at early to middle S phase, but the level of cyclin A was still quite low, and these cells were categorized as G1 phase of cells. A small percentage of cells with cyclin A + did not show the LT-HB signal or RNA synthesis at laser stripes ( Figures 3 F or 3G, right panels), which should be due to that some cells were severely damaged during laser irradiation.
It was found that the LT-HB signal was significantly decreased in the RNAPIII (RPC1 or RPC7 subunit) knockdown cells ( Figures 3 H and 3I). Enlarged images at the first or 30 th minute in Figures 3 H and 3I are presented in Figure S3 B. The level of RPC1 or RPC7 in the siRPC1- or shRPC7-treated cells is shown in Figure 3 H, bottom-left panel, and Figure 3 I, top-right panel. The cell growth cycle in the siRPC1- or shRPC7-treated cells was not noticeably affected with respect of unsynchronized cell growth and double-thymidine arresting and release, compared to the untreated cells ( Figures S3 C and S3D). The ratios of cells showing the ST-HB or LT-HB are presented in Figure 3 H, bottom-right panel, and Figure 3 I, bottom-right panel. When RPC7 ∗ , which cannot be inhibited by shRPC7, was expressed in the shRPC7-treated cells, the EGFP-HB signals at laser stripes were recovered ( Figure 3 J). Taken together, these results indicate that the LT-HB signal results from the binding of EGFP-HB-NLS to the RNA-DNA hybrids at DSBs in which the RNA strand is newly synthesized by RNAPIII.
To determine what causes the ST-HB signal at DSBs, a few inhibitors were tested, including DRB (5, 6-dichloro-1-β-D-ribofuranosyl-1H-benzimidazole) that inhibits transcription elongation catalyzed by RNAPII and Olaparib that inhibits poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). The inhibition analysis revealed that DRB slightly reduced the intensity of the ST-HB fluorescent signal by ~15% (data not shown), suggesting that RNAPII and its catalyzing RNA transcription should not be the main cause for the ST-HB signal, which is consistent with the finding that RNAPII is not localized to DSBs ( Figures 1 B and 1H; Figure S1 B). The ~15% reduction of the ST-HB signal may be due to the inhibition of ongoing RNA transcription that happens to be around the laser micro-irradiated stripe. Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerization is an early event that is catalyzed by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) for the recruitment of DSB repair proteins to DSB sites ( Beck et al., 2014 3. Beck, C. ∙ Robert, I. ∙ Reina-San-Martin, B. ... Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases in double-strand break repair: focus on PARP1, PARP2 and PARP3 Exp. Cell Res. 2014; 329 :18-25 Crossref Scopus (235) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wei and Yu, 2016 49. Wei, H. ∙ Yu, X. Functions of PARylation in DNA Damage Repair Pathways Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics. 2016; 14 :131-139 Crossref Scopus (204) PubMed Google Scholar ). Since, structurally, the poly(ADP-ribose) chain is quite similar to a DNA or RNA chain, we tested whether the inhibition of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerization affects the ST-HB signal. It was found that Olaparib dramatically decreased the ST-HB signal to nearly a background level ( Figures 3 K and 3L). This result suggests that poly(ADP-ribose) chain is recognized by EGFP-HB-NLS for generating the ST-HB signals. In addition, in a PARP1 knockout cell line in which 85%–90% of poly(ADP-ribose) modification is abolished ( Bai and Cantó, 2012 2. Bai, P. ∙ Cantó, C. The role of PARP-1 and PARP-2 enzymes in metabolic regulation and disease Cell Metab. 2012; 16 :290-295 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (240) PubMed Google Scholar ), the EGFP-HB signal was detected only in the cells at the S and G2 phases ( Figure 3 M). Thus, these results indicate that the LT-HB signal reflects the RNA-DNA hybrids structure that is formed at DSBs specifically in the cells at the S and G2 phases. And RNAPIII catalyzes the synthesis of the RNA strand in the RNA-DNA hybrids.
Since previous searching for additional HR proteins suggested that RNAPIII may associate with MRN during DSB repair, before investigating the mechanism by which RNAPIII is recruited to DSBs, we first confirmed the interaction between RNAPIII and the MRN complex. To this end, we performed an IP experiment against RPC3-3FLAG (3FLAG is tagged to the C-terminal of RPC3 endogenously by CRISPR-Cas9) with nuclear extracts prepared from VP16-treated cells. MRE11 was detected in the brought-down fraction ( Figure 4 A, left). As expected, RPC7 was also found in the brought-down fraction with IP against RPC3-3FLAG ( Figure 4 A, left). In the VP16-untreated cells, MRE11 was undetectable in the brought-down fraction ( Figure 4 A, left), suggesting that the amount of RPC3 associated with MRE11 significantly increased after DNA break. A reciprocal IP experiment confirmed the interaction between MRE11 and RPC3-3FLAG ( Figure 4 A, right). Furthermore, the yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assay was used to determine the subunits in RNAPIII and the MRN complex that bring them together. All 17 subunits of RNAPIII (fused to Gal4 activating domain) and three MRN subunits—MRE11, RAD50, and NBS1 (fused to Gal4 DNA binding domain)—were screened. The results displayed in Figure 4 B show that the yeast cells co-transfected with MRE11 and RNAPIII-specific subunit RPC4 or RPC6 could grow on four dropout medium (Leu – , Trp – , His – , Ade – ). This result suggests that there is a basic level of interaction between RNAPIII and MRN complex through the Mre11 subunit in MRN and the RPC4, 6 subunits in RNAPIII. When DSBs occur, this interaction may recruit RNAPIII to DSBs.
To examine whether the MRN complex is responsible for recruiting RNAPIII to DSBs, the level of RPC7 on chromatin was measured in the VP16-treated and MRE11 knockdown cells. As shown in Figure 4 C, the amount of RPC7 on chromatin was remarkably increased when DSBs were induced in the presence of VP16. However, this increase was no longer detected when the cellular amount of MRE11 was depleted by approximately 80% in the shMRE11-treated cells. The level of RPC7 in chromatin was restored when a shMRE11-resistant MRE11 ∗ was overexpressed in the MRE11-depleted cells ( Figure 4 C). Additionally, the fluorescence intensity of RPC1 at DSBs decreased significantly in the shMRE11-treated cells, but the RPC1 fluorescence signal recovered when shMRE11-resistant MRE11 was expressed in the cells ( Figures 4 D and 4E), which supports an essential role of MRN in recruiting RNAPIII to DSBs. As shown in Figure 4 F, the distribution of cell-cycle phases was not altered in the MRE11 knockdown cells. Taken together, these results indicate that RNAPIII is actively recruited to DSBs by the MRN complex.
To investigate whether end resection plays a role for the RNA-DNA hybrid formation at DSBs, we developed a CtIP knockout (KO) U2OS cell line ( Figures 5 A–5C), using CRISPR-Cas9 technique targeting the sixth exon (176 bp). There are three CtIP alleles in U2OS cells ( Przetocka et al., 2018 37. Przetocka, S. ∙ Porro, A. ∙ Bolck, H.A. ... CtIP-Mediated Fork Protection Synergizes with BRCA1 to Suppress Genomic Instability upon DNA Replication Stress Mol. Cell. 2018; 72 :568-582 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (86) PubMed Google Scholar ). Sequencing analysis indicated that this CtIP knockout cell line has a single base “ T ” insertion in two CtIP gene alleles and a 151-bases insertion including 24 repeats of the telomere sequence TTAGGG in the third allele, based on the levels of PCR products (the ratio of a′: b′ is approximately 2:1), as shown in Figures 5 A and 5B. Both mutations occur at the guide RNA targeted site, and they cause an open reading frame (ORF) shift ( Figure 5 B). Unexpectedly, western blotting analysis detected a slight amount (~1/40 of WT level) of CtIP in the CtIP gene knockout cells ( Figure 5 C). This small amount of CtIP, which may result from a rare alternative splicing of mRNAs, supports cell growth, as CtIP is known to be essential for cells. An experiment in this CtIP-KO cell line showed that the recruitment of RNAPIII to DSBs was not affected ( Figures S4 A and S4B). However, the formation of the LT-HB signal was dramatically reduced in the CtIP KO cells at the G2 phase but recovered when a wild-type CtIP was expressed ( Figures 5 D and 5E). As expected, the ST-HB signal was not affected ( Figures 5 D and 5E). The fluorescent images at the first and 30 th minute in Figure 5 D are enlarged and presented in Figure S4 E, in order to see the LT-HB and ST-HB signals more clearly. Flow-cytometry analysis indicated that, compared to wild-type cells, the cell-cycle distribution did not noticeably change in the CtIP-KO cells ( Figure S4 C). The synchronization by double-thymidine and release was not altered either for the CtIP KO cells ( Figure S4 D), compared to WT cells ( Figure 3 A).
Moreover, the inhibition of MRE11 exonuclease activity by Mirin also abolished the LT-HB signal ( Figures 5 F and 5G; see enlarged images in Figure S4 F), but the ST-HB signal was not affected ( Figures 5 F and 5G). But the fluorescence analysis of RPC1 indicates that the localization of RPC1 to DSBs was not affected in the Mirin-treated cells ( Figures 5 H and 5I), suggesting that RNAPIII is normally recruited to DSBs when the MRE11 nuclease activity is inhibited. Both CtIP and Mre11 nuclease activity is required for the initiation of end resection, which removes approximately a few dozen nucleotides from the 5′-ended strand to generate a ssDNA region in the 3′-ended strand ( Cannavo and Cejka, 2014 6. Cannavo, E. ∙ Cejka, P. Sae2 promotes dsDNA endonuclease activity within Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 to resect DNA breaks Nature. 2014; 514 :122-125 Crossref Scopus (319) PubMed Google Scholar ; Symington and Gautier, 2011 46. Symington, L.S. ∙ Gautier, J. Double-strand break end resection and repair pathway choice Annu. Rev. Genet. 2011; 45 :247-271 Crossref Scopus (1166) PubMed Google Scholar ). Together, these results suggest that a limited end resection, which is catalyzed by MRN-CtIP, is required for RNAPIII-mediated RNA synthesis and the subsequent formation of RNA-DNA hybrids at DSBs. A possible reason for this is that a short ssDNA region on the 3′-strand, which is generated by MRN-CtIP-mediated end-resection initiation, is required for initiation of RNA synthesis by RNAPIII at DSBs.
To determine whether the formation of RNA-DNA hybrids is required for HR-mediated DSB repair, we measured the rate of DSB-induced HR in cells with decreased amount of RPC1 after treatment with siRPC1, or in cells treated with 40 μM of RNAPIII inhibitor ML-60218. The experimental system used to measure the rate of DSB-induced HR is outlined in Figure 6 A. When HR occurs, an intact gene encoding the GFP protein is generated ( Pierce et al., 2001 35. Pierce, A.J. ∙ Hu, P. ∙ Han, M. ... Ku DNA end-binding protein modulates homologous repair of double-strand breaks in mammalian cells Genes Dev. 2001; 15 :3237-3242 Crossref Scopus (445) PubMed Google Scholar ). As shown in Figures 6 B and 6C, a decreased level of RPC1 by siRPC1 or inhibition of RNAPIII by ML-60218 reduced the rate of HR by nearly 50% and 30%, respectively. The rate of HR was further decreased when the cells were treated with both siRPC1 and Mirin, compared with cells treated only with siRPC1 ( Figure 6 B). However, in the Mirin-treated cells, additional siRPC1 treatment did not further decrease the HR rate ( Figure 6 B). These results indicate that RNAPIII and the nuclease activity of the MRN complex are required for HR. Taking the results presented here and in Figures 4 and 5 , we conclude that RNAPIII functions after end-resection initiation by MRN-CtIP.
To gain further insight into the mechanism requiring the formation of RNA-DNA hybrids for HR, we first examined whether end resection is affected when either the RNA synthesis or the formation of RNA-DNA hybrids is disrupted, considering that both of these two events occur at very early stage of the HR process ( Figures 1 C, 1D, 2 C, and 3 B) ( Symington and Gautier, 2011 46. Symington, L.S. ∙ Gautier, J. Double-strand break end resection and repair pathway choice Annu. Rev. Genet. 2011; 45 :247-271 Crossref Scopus (1166) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhang et al., 2016 52. Zhang, H. ∙ Hua, Y. ∙ Li, R. ... Cdc24 Is Essential for Long-range End Resection in the Repair of Double-stranded DNA Breaks J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291 :24961-24973 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ). To this end, we took advantage of the GAPDH-I-SceI U2OS cell line in which an I-SceI site was inserted at the second intron of the GAPDH gene by CRISPR-Cas9 technique, as shown in Figure 6 D. The four restriction enzyme BanII sites at the left side with different distances to the I-SceI site are shown. The efficiency of end resection was measured in the siRPC1- and siCtrl-treated cells, with a method depicted in Figure 6 D. When the end resection of the 5′-strand passes through BanII sites, it will generate ssDNA regions (3′ ssDNA overhang) at these BanII sites that are resistant to BanII digestion. Then, a qPCR can determine the percentage of dsDNA region at each BanII site that has been converted into ssDNA by end resection ( Zhang et al., 2016 52. Zhang, H. ∙ Hua, Y. ∙ Li, R. ... Cdc24 Is Essential for Long-range End Resection in the Repair of Double-stranded DNA Breaks J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291 :24961-24973 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ). In three independent assays, the cutting efficiency at the I-SceI site was 35%–52% (data not shown). The results shown in Figure 6 E indicate that the end resection was significantly reduced in the siRPC1-treated cells, compared to siCtrl-treated cells at all four examined BanII sites, which are 100, 850, 3,926, and 10,000 bp away from the I-SceI site, respectively. These results suggest that RNAPIII-mediated RNA synthesis at DSB sites significantly promotes end resection at both early and late stages, considering the end resection within ~100 or 200 bp of DNA regions around the I-SceI break site as early stage.
We also measured the formation of RAD51 and RPA32 foci in siCtr- and siRPC1-treated cells. As shown in Figures 6 F and 6G, the number of RAD51 or RPA32 foci in the siRPC1-treated cells was dramatically reduced, while γH2AX foci remained almost unchanged. In addition, the percentage of cells showing more than twenty RAD51 or RPA32 foci per cell was reduced by nearly 50% in siRPC1-treated cells ( Figure 6 H, middle and right panels). However, a similar percentage (approximately 50%) of cells showed γH2AX foci in the siCtr- and siRPC1-treated cells ( Figure 6 H, left panel). DNA breaks in those assays were induced by VP16 treatment. These results further suggest that the RNAPIII-mediated DSB-RNA synthesis promotes end resection.
Since the DNA strand in the RNA-DNA hybrids is the 3′ ssDNA overhang, the formation of RNA-DNA hybrids may have a direct effect on the stability of the 3′ ssDNA overhangs during end resection. To verify this, we directly examined whether genetic loss occurs at DSBs when the formation of RNA-DNA hybrids is inhibited. A hygromycin r ( hph ) gene is located approximately 2,000 bp downstream to the I-SceI cleavage site ( Figure 7 A). After a DSB is generated by I-SceI cleavage, an extensive end resection, which may still be performed by EXO1 even without RNAPIII-promoted end resection but in a less extent, will remove the 5′ strand of the hph r gene. If the generated 3′-ssDNA overhang is not protected, the cells with partial or total loss of the hph r gene will become sensitive to hygromycin. The results shown in Figures 7 B and 7C reveal that approximately 8%–9% of the cells lost the hph r gene in the siRPC1-treated cells, while only ~3% cells lost the hph r gene in the siCtrl-treated cells. In the presence of ML-60218, the loss rate of the hph r gene was about 12%, while in the control cells the loss rate was about 2% ( Figure 7 C). The rate of hph r gene loss was also measured in the MRN, CtIP, or RPC7 knockdown cells. Like in RPC1 knockdown cells, the RPC7 knockdown cells exhibited about a 13% hph r loss rate, but MRN or CtIP depletion did not increase the hph r loss rate compared to control cells ( Figures 7 D and 7E).
To more precisely reveal the molecular nature of genetic alterations around DSB sites in WT and siRPC1-treated cells, a DNA region of about 250 bp at each side of the I-SceI site was sequenced. Genomic DNA was prepared from cells transfected by the I-SceI expression plasmid for 24 or 72 h ( Figure 7 F). For the samples transfected for 24 h, the overall mutation rate was relatively low (around 1%) in siRPC1-treated or -untreated cells ( Figure 7 G). These mutations were further sub-grouped as point mutations, 1–3 bp indel, 4–30 bp deletion, >30 bp deletion, and >3 bp insertion. Except that the mutation of >30 bp (several dozen to several hundreds) deletion was increased by about 2-fold in the siRPC1-treated cells, the other types of mutation rates were basically the same between WT and siRPC1-treated cells ( Figure 7 G). For the cell samples collected 72 h after the transfection of the I-SceI plasmid, the overall mutation rate was apparently increased in both siCtr- or siRPC1-treated cells. However, the rate of mutations increased about 2-fold faster in the siRPC1-treated cells compared with siCtr-treated cells. Correspondingly, the mutation rate of >30 bp deletion was about 4- to 5-fold higher in the siRPC1-treated cells than in the siCtr-treated cells ( Figure 7 H). However, for the other types of mutations, there was no much difference between the siRPC1-treated cells and the siCtr-treated cells ( Figure 7 H). The 1- to 3-bp indel should result from the repair of DSBs by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). A similar rate of 1- to 3-bp indel in the Ctrl- or siRPC1-treated cells suggests that the NHEJ pathway was not much affected in the siRPC1-treated cells, which is consistent with RNAPIII functioning in HR and HR-mediated DSB repair. Here, the rate of NHEJ did not increase, while the rate of HR decreased in the siRPC1-treated cells. A possible explanation is that initiation of end resection is not affected by the reduction of RNAPIII in the siRPC1-treated cells, because the localization or recruitment of CtIP and MRN to DSBs was not affected by a reduced level of RNAPIII ( Figures S5 A and S5B). Once end resection initiates, it will go on to either HR-mediated repair, microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ), or abortion of HR-mediated repair; thus, the NHEJ pathway should not be affected. Consistent with the logic, DNA sequencing in both siCtr- or siRPC1-treated cells indicates that almost all break repairs in the category of >30 bp deletion resulted from MMEJ (data not shown), because, once end resection initiates, dsDNA breaks either get unrepaired (HR abortion and cell death) or go to the MMEJ pathway for getting repaired efficiently. Taken together, these results demonstrate that RNAPIII and the formation of RNA-DNA hybrids at DSB site are required for end resection and the protection of the 3′-ssDNA overhangs.

DNA homologous recombination (HR) and HR-mediated repair of double-strand DNA breaks play a critical role in preserving genome integrity. This biological process consists of end resection, strand invasion and subsequent DNA synthesis, and resolution of Holliday junctions. The molecular mechanisms of strand invasion and resolution of Holliday junctions are relatively well established, largely due to their mechanistic similarity to the same events occurring in prokaryotes. However, the end resection in eukaryotes appears to be much more complicated, due to the chromatin structure and a strict regulation restricting end resection to the S and G2 phase of the cell-division cycle. Not much progress was made in the mechanistic study of end resection until 2008 when Dna2 and Exo1 were found to play a direct role in resecting the 5′-ended strand ( Mimitou and Symington, 2008 26. Mimitou, E.P. ∙ Symington, L.S. Sae2, Exo1 and Sgs1 collaborate in DNA double-strand break processing Nature. 2008; 455 :770-774 Crossref Scopus (807) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhu et al., 2008 55. Zhu, Z. ∙ Chung, W.H. ∙ Shim, E.Y. ... Sgs1 helicase and two nucleases Dna2 and Exo1 resect DNA double-strand break ends Cell. 2008; 134 :981-994 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (840) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, some critical questions related to end resection remain open. For example, a very critical question related to end resection is how the 3′-ended strands are protected during the degradation of the 5′-ended strands. The present study reveals that eukaryotic cells protect the 3′-ended strands by forming an RNA-DNA hybrid during end resection. This study also demonstrated that RNAPIII is responsible for catalyzing the synthesis of the RNA strand in the RNA-DNA hybrid.
The detection of RNAPIII and RNA-DNA hybrids in the first minute after DSBs indicates that these events are among the first to occur in the process of DSB repair. This is consistent with the requirement that the 3′-ssDNA overhangs must be protected at the very beginning of end resection. Based on our results, we propose that, once the MRN complex binds to DSBs, the MRN complex recruits RNAPIII to DSBs. The requirement of CtIP and the nuclease activity of the MRN complex suggest that the initial resection of the 5′ strand by MRN and CtIP exposes a ssDNA region of a few dozen to ~200–300 nucleotides on the 3′ strand ( Cannavo and Cejka, 2014 6.

Sgs1 helicase and two nucleases Dna2 and Exo1 resect DNA double-strand break ends Cell. 2008; 134 :981-994 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (840) PubMed Google Scholar ), and RNAPIII uses this ssDNA region as a template to start RNA synthesis. Previous studies have indicated that ssDNA molecules may efficiently serve as RNAPIII templates for RNA synthesis ( Roeder et al., 1976 38. Roeder, R.G. ∙ Schwartz, L.B. ∙ Sklar, V.E. Function, structure, and regulation of eukaryotic nuclear RNA polymerases Symp. Soc. Dev. Biol. 1976; 34 :29-52 Google Scholar ; Schroder et al., 2003 43.

Circularized synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides serve as promoterless RNA polymerase III templates for small RNA generation in human cells Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41 :2552-2564 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ). Continuous RNA synthesis, together with helicase action, will displace a piece of 5′ DNA strand and generate a flap DNA structure. This flap structure is an ideal substrate for DNA2 flap endonuclease. This is likely the reason that end resection was inhibited when RNAPIII was depleted by siRPC1 ( Figure 6 E), and RNA synthesis and the formation of RNA-DNA hybrids are correspondingly repressed ( Figure 3 G). Through multiple cycles of RNA synthesis and helicase action, 5′-strand displacement and generation of flap structures, and removal of flap structures by DNA2 cleavage, together with exonucleolytic digestion by EXO1, the 5′ strand is resected. Simultaneously, the RNA-DNA hybrids are formed to protect the 3′-strand overhang during end resection ( Figure 7 I). The promotion of end resection by RNAPIII ( Figure 6 E) suggests that RNA synthesis by RNAPIII plays an important role in generating flap structures for DNA2 cleavage, apart from the action of WRN and BLM helicases in generating flap structures ( Sturzenegger et al., 2014 45. Sturzenegger, A. ∙ Burdova, K. ∙ Kanagaraj, R. ... DNA2 cooperates with the WRN and BLM RecQ helicases to mediate long-range DNA end resection in human cells J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289 :27314-27326 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (154) PubMed Google Scholar ). This is consistent with one of the fundamental properties of RNA polymerases-mediated transcription events—the 5′ strand is displaced as RNA polymerases move along the 3′ strand and synthesize RNA. This may explain, at least partially, why Rqh1 helicase in fission yeast is not strictly required for end resection ( Langerak et al., 2011 17. Langerak, P. ∙ Mejia-Ramirez, E. ∙ Limbo, O. ... Release of Ku and MRN from DNA ends by Mre11 nuclease activity and Ctp1 is required for homologous recombination repair of double-strand breaks PLoS Genet. 2011; 7 :e1002271 Crossref Scopus (184) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhang et al., 2016 52. Zhang, H. ∙ Hua, Y. ∙ Li, R. ... Cdc24 Is Essential for Long-range End Resection in the Repair of Double-stranded DNA Breaks J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291 :24961-24973 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The Dna2-mediated resection of the 5′-ended strand, as discussed above, is probably promoted by the RNAPIII-mediated RNA synthesis. However, RNAPIII should not be required for the Exo1-catalyzed end resection. Thus, under the inhibition of RNA synthesis either by reducing the level of RNAPIII (siRPC1, shRPC7) or inhibiting its activity in the presence of ML-60218, a certain level of end resection by Exo1 should still occur, resulting in a ssDNA region on the 3′-ended strand. If this ssDNA region does not have protection through the formation of RNA-DNA hybrid, it will be cut by nucleases at breaks, potentially resulting in genetic loss ( Figures 7 A–7H). By analyzing the types of genetic mutations around DNA break sites, it was found that only the rate of genetic deletion >30 bp increased in the siRPC1-treated cells, but point mutations, 1- to 3-bp indel, >3-bp insertion, and 4- to 30-bp deletion occurred at similar rates in the control cells and the cells with a reduced level of RNAPIII ( Figures 7 G and 7H). These findings suggest that NHEJ should not be affected by the depletion of RNAPIII. Since CtIP and MRE11 nuclease activity is required for the formation of RNA-DNA hybrids at DSBs ( Figure 5 ), RNA synthesis catalyzed by RNAPIII should take place after CtIP-MRN complex initiates end resection. Therefore, the depletion of RNAPIII affects the formation of RNA-DNA hybrids, the rate of HR, and genetic integrity around DNA breaks. However, RNAPIII should not have an effect on the pathway selection of HR and NHEJ.
After end resection, the RNA strand in the RNA-DNA hybrids will be degraded for subsequent assembly of RAD51 on the 3′-ssDNA overhang. A few previous studies observed the generation of small RNAs at DSBs ( Francia et al., 2012 11. Francia, S. ∙ Michelini, F. ∙ Saxena, A. ... Site-specific DICER and DROSHA RNA products control the DNA-damage response Nature. 2012; 488 :231-235 Crossref Scopus (424) PubMed Google Scholar ; Michalik et al., 2012 24. Michalik, K.M. ∙ Böttcher, R. ∙ Förstemann, K. A small RNA response at DNA ends in Drosophila Nucleic Acids Res. 2012; 40 :9596-9603 Crossref Scopus (112) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wei et al., 2012 50. Wei, W. ∙ Ba, Z. ∙ Gao, M. ... A role for small RNAs in DNA double-strand break repair Cell. 2012; 149 :101-112 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (481) PubMed Google Scholar ). These small RNAs should be the degradation products of RNA strand in the RNA-DNA hybrids. Besides, the time point for the degradation of the RNA strand must be strictly regulated. A premature removal of the RNA strand, or removal before the completion of end resection, will expose the 3′-ssDNA overhang, which increases the risk of cleavage by nucleases, such as DNA2. If the RNA strand is not timely removed after end resection, the formation of RAD51 filament and subsequent repair processes will be affected. In either case, it will affect the efficiency of HR-mediated DSB repair and potentially result in genetic deletion. This may explain the findings that either the deletion of RNase H1 and RNase H2 or the overexpression of RNase H1 affects the efficiency of HR-mediated DSB repair ( Ohle et al., 2016 30. Ohle, C. ∙ Tesorero, R. ∙ Schermann, G. ... Transient RNA-DNA Hybrids Are Required for Efficient Double-Strand Break Repair Cell. 2016; 167 :1001-1013 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (278) PubMed Google Scholar ).
This study demonstrated that (1) RNA polymerase III is an essential factor in HR or HR-mediated repair of DSBs; (2) the RNA-DNA hybrid at DSB is an essential repair intermediate in the process of HR-mediated DSB repair; (3) RNAPIII is actively recruited to DSBs by the MRN complex; (4) RNAPIII is responsible for catalyzing RNA strand synthesis in the RNA-DNA hybrids; (5) both CtIP and MRN nuclease activity is required for the formation of RNA-DNA hybrids at DSBs, suggesting that a short ssDNA region on the 3′-ended strand, which is generated by the CtIP-MRN complex-mediated degradation of the 5′-ended strand, is required for initiating RNA synthesis; (6) RNAPIII promotes end resection, suggesting that RNA synthesis displaces the 5′-ended strand to generate flap structures for DNA2 digestion; and (7) the biological function of the RNA-DNA hybrids at DSBs is to protect the 3′-ssDNA overhangs during end resection. This study demonstrates that RNA polymerase III is an essential factor for the HR-mediated repair of DSBs and that the RNA-DNA hybrids at DSBs are an essential repair intermediate.

U2OS (ATCC, Cat# HTB-96), HEK293T (ATCC, Cat# CRL-3216) cell lines were authenticated by Genewiz technology (Jiangsu, China) using standard STR method. U2OS DR-GFP cells were from Maria Jasin lab ( Pierce et al., 1999 34. Pierce, A.J. ∙ Johnson, R.D. ∙ Thompson, L.H. ... XRCC3 promotes homology-directed repair of DNA damage in mammalian cells Genes Dev. 1999; 13 :2633-2638 Crossref Scopus (1125) PubMed Google Scholar ). The three cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-Glutamine and antibiotics. Cells were maintained at 37°C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. The CRISPR-Cas9 edited cells were derived from the three basic cell lines.
For plasmid transfection, cells were plated one day before transfection. Then, transfected using X-tremeGENETM HP (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat# 6366236001) according to the manufacture’s protocol. For siRNA transfection, cells were plated one day before transfection, and then transfected siRNAs with Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Fisher, Cat# L3000008) according to the manufacture’s protocol. For shRNA transfection, co-transfect the pLKO.1 plasmid bearing specific shRNA, pCMV-VSVG and delta R8.2 to 293T cells for 48 hours, then collect the supernatant, use it to transfect the targeted cell lines. The siRNAs were purchased from Ribobio technology (Guangdong, China).
1x10 5 cells were seeded onto one well of a 12-well plate. After 12 hours, co-transfecting 1 μg lentiCRISPRv2 bearing specific guide DNA and 0.5 μg of donor plasmid to cells. After 2 days, the cells were transferred to a 10 cm dish with additional incubation for 24 hours. Then, 800 μg/ml of neomycin (or 2 μg/ml puromycin for GAPSH-I-SceI cell line) was added, continue culture for one week for selecting desired cells. The positive cells were sorted by flow cytometry and expand cultured. The obtained cell lines were examined by DNA sequencing and western blotting.
U2OS cells were plated in a number of 2.5 × 10 5 on a glass-bottom dish (NEST, Cat# 801001) 24 hours before experiment. Laser micro-point irradiation was conducted under an inverted confocal microscope (Dragonfly, LeicaDMI8) with a micro-point laser workstation (Andor). After laser irradiation, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and then fixed with cold methanol (−20°C) for 10 minutes on ice or 0.4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at RT. Cells were then washed twice with cold PBS, blocked with blocking buffer (PBS containing 1% BSA and 6% FBS) at room temperature for 60 minutes. After blocking, cells were incubated with primary antibody diluted in blocking buffer at 4°C for overnight. Next, cells were washed three times with cold PBS and incubated with secondary antibody diluted in blocking buffer at room temperature for 2 hours. DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat# D9542-5MG) staining was conducted after/with secondary antibody incubation at a concentration of 10 μg/ml. Wash cells three times with cold PBS and cover with mounting medium. Images were captured using a DeltaVision Elite (Applied Precision) or Dragonfly (LeicaDMI8) microscope, images were analyzed by Imaris software. For live cell laser micro-point irradiation, the indicated plasmids were transfected into U2OS cells 24 hours after plating. Laser micro-point irradiation was conducted 24 hours after transfection. Images were captured at the indicated time point.
Preparation of 3FLAG-HB-6His protein: HB (RNA-DNA Hybrid Binding) domain is derived from human RNase H1. 3FLAG-HB-6His protein was overexpressed in E. coli and subsequently purified with Ni 2+ -column (QIAGEN, Cat# 30230) and conventional chromatography. Purified 3FLAG-HB-6His was mixed with FLAG antibody-affinity gel (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat# A2220) to prepare for the HB column. Extra 3FLAG-HB-6His was washed away with PBS buffer. To prepare genomic DNA from the cells transfected with plasmid expressing restrictive endonuclease I-Sce1, the GAPDH-I-Sce1 U2OS cells were transfected with I-Sce1-expression plasmid for 15 hr. The cells were then collected, washed with PBS twice, and lysed with cold buffer (20 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 10 mM KCl, 10 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP-40) on ice for 15 min. Chromatin was collected by centrifugation (1000 g) for 8 min. The chromatin was extracted with a high-salt buffer (HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 600 mM KCl, 10 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP-40, 10% glycerol) and subsequently subjected to digestion of proteinase K (1mg/ml) at 37°C for 8-12 hr. DNA was precipitated with ethanol and resuspended in TE buffer. Chromatin DNA was sonicated to an average size of 500 bp. RNaseH-treated or untreated chromatin DNA was subjected protein-RNA-DNA hybrid affinity chromatography with 3FLAG-HB-6His gel. The captured RNA-DNA hybrid-3FLAG-HB-6His gel was incubated at 90°C for 10 min for denaturing the HB domain and releasing RNA-DNA hybrids. Then, Duplex specific nuclease (Evrogen, Cat# EA001) was added and incubated at 70°C for 30 min to digest the DNA strands in the RNA-DNA hybrids. To completely digest DNA, the samples were further digested with DNase I at 37°C for 30 min, followed by heating at 90°C for 10 min to denature these nucleases. Reverse transcription was carried out with designed primers and superscripts-reverse transcriptase (NEB, Cat# M0368S). After incubation at 90°C for 10 min to denature the reverse transcriptase, PCR reactions were carried out with indicated primers. For detecting the formation of RNA-DNA hybrids at the AsisI-mediated break, the experimental method is same as for I-SceI-mediated break. The AsisI-cutting sites chosen in this study were already examined in Jiazhi Hu’s lab at Peking University (unpublished data). We use custom human genome (hg19) sequence for following primer design.
Cover glass plates were soaked in 70% ethanol, followed by flame sterilization and put in a well (6-well plate). After washing the glass plates with PBS twice, a certain amount of cells was inoculated and grew to a log phase. Then, the cells were treated with a chemical (DNA damage agents) for indicated time. Again, cells were washed with PBS to remove chemical, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min. The cells, after washing away paraformaldehyde with PBS, were lysed with PBS plus 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min, washed with PBS three times, and blocked with a blocking buffer (PBS supplemented with 6% FBS and 1% BSA) at room temperature for 60 min. Then first antibody was added and kept at 4°C for overnight. After washing with PBS to remove first antibody, second antibody in blocking buffer was added and kept at room temperature for 2hrs. After washing with PBS for three times, the glass place with cells on it was upside-down put on a glass slide, sealed with nail polishing oil, and subjected to examination under microscopy after drying.
U2OS/293T cells with RPC3-3FLAG-P2A-Neomycin integrated in the RPC3 locus were treated with 5 μM VP16 (Etoposide, Selleck, Cat# S1225) or DMSO. After 3 hr, the cells were harvested, washed with cold PBS, resuspended in the buffer A (20 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, 0.05% NP-40, 1 mM DTT, protease inhibitors (Transgen, Cat#DI101-01)), and kept on ice for 20 min. Then, the cells were collected, resuspended in the lysis buffer B (20 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 120 mM KCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM DTT, protease inhibitors) for the preparation of chromatin. Chromatin extracts were prepared with the bufferA plus 0.6 M KCl. The supernatant was diluted to salt concentration of 100 mM and subjected to immunoprecipitation with MRE11 antibody.
U2OS cells were treated with 5 μM VP16 or DMSO for 3 hours. Then, the cells were harvested, washed with ice-cold PBS for 3 times and resuspended in the buffer (20 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM KCl, 0.05% NP-40, 1 mM DTT, protease inhibitor, phosphatase inhibitor mix) for 20 min on ice. The cells were harvested and resuspended in the lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 120 mM KCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM DTT, protease inhibitors). The chromatin were obtained by centrifugation and resuspended in the chromatin extract buffer (20 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 600 mM KCl, 1% Triton X-100, 25% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, protease inhibitors) for 30 min. The supernatant was collected by centrifugation and subjected to analysis.
For the RNAi experiment, U2OS DR-GFP cells were first transfected with either RPC1 siRNA or control siRNA. After two days, cells were transfected with an empty vector or an I-SceI expression vector, in which RFP was co-expressed. Cells were harvested two days after the transfection of I-SceI expression plasmid and subjected to flow cytometry analysis to examine GFP signal after DNA double-strand break. Only RFP-positive cells were analyzed for HR efficiency considering possible differences of transfection efficiency. Flowjo software was used to reveal the percentage of GFP-positive cells relative to the number of transfected cells (RFP positive). The data were then compared to a control siRNA treatment in each individual experiment. The dividing line between GFP-positive and negative cells was set to 1% of the background level in every no-I-SceI control. This gate was then applied to the plus-I-SceI sample to determine HR efficiency. For the RNA polymerase Ш inhibitor experiment, ML-60218 (Calbiochem) were added to a final concentration of 40 μM just before transfection with the empty vector or I-SceI, the same volume of DMSO was used as a control. Cells were also harvested and analyzed two days after I-SceI transfection.
U2OS DR-GFP cells were first transfected with either RPC1 siRNA or control siRNA, and after two days, were transfected with an empty vector or an I-SceI expression vector, in which RFP was co-expressed. After two days of I-SceI transfection, cells were trypsinized and counted. 1.5 x10 5 cells or 0.5 x10 5 cells were re-plated to 6-well plates. A final concentration of 300 ug/ml Hygromycin B was added 8 hours later. The drug was washed out 2 days later and cells were cultured after another 3 days. The cells were trypsinized and counted. For the RNA polymerase Ш inhibitor experiment, ML-60218 (Calbiochem, Cat# 557403) was added to a final concentration of 40 μM just before transfection with the empty vector or I-SceI, the same volume of DMSO was used as a control. Cells were also trypsinized and replated to 6-well plates. After Hygromycin B treatement, cells were collected and counted. Each sample was counted five times and an average number was used to calculate cell survival rate.
By using CRISPR-Cas9 technology, 3FLAG was engineered to the C terminus of RPC3 gene in U2OS DRGFP cells, creating a cell line of U2OS DRGFP-RPC-3FLAG. U2OS DRGFP-RPC-3FLAG cells was first transfected with I-SceI expression plasmid for 13 hr. Then, harvest cells and fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Then, glycine (125 mM) was added to the culture for 6 min for stopping the cross-linking reaction. Chromatin preparation, sonication (shearing chromatin to an average size of 0.5 kb) and subsequent ChIPs were then performed with a routine method. The qPCR primers: forward 5′- CAAGATCCGCCACAACATCG-3′; reverse 5′-TCCAGCAGGACCATGTGATC-3′.
Using CRISPR-Cas9 technology, an I-SceI recognition site, together with human PGK promoter and puromycin resistant gene, was engineered into the second intron of GAPDH gene in U2OS cells, creating a cell line-U2OS GAPDH-I-SceI. For end resection assay, U2OS GAPDH-I-SceI cells were first transfected with either RPC1 or control siRNA. After 60 hr, the cells were transfected with I-SceI expression plasmid. After 13 hr, genomic DNA was prepared and subjected to BanII digestion, followed by keeping the reactions at 85°C for 25min to denature BanII enzyme and subsequent qPCR analysis. The ssDNA% was calculated with the following equation: ssDNA% = 1/(2ˆ(4Ct-1)+0.5) ∗ 100. End resection efficiency was measured by comparing the ssDNA% with cut efficiency. The detailed principle of this assay was described in Zhou et al.’ article ( Zhou et al., 2014 54. Zhou, Y. ∙ Caron, P. ∙ Legube, G. ...

The primers used for qPCR: 100 bp-foward: 5′-tgccatcaatgaccccttca-3′, 100 bp-reverse: 5′- ggggatcctacgtgagggtat-3′. 850 bp-foward: 5′-gggagcacaggtaagtgcat-3′, 850 bp-reverse: 5′- ggaaaccagatctcccaccg-3′. 3926 bp-foward: 5′-tgctgagtcaccttcgaacc-3′, 3926 bp-reverse: 5′-actgtcttctccccgcaaag-3′. 10000 bp-foward: 5′-tgatgaacctgctgtccctg-3′, 10000 bp-reverse: 5′- gcaatgctccccactttcct-3′. The primers used for measuring the rate of break at I-SceI site: I-SceI-forward: 5′-tacatggtgagccccaaagc-3′, I-SceI-reverse: 5′-ccccaaccccaagcttgata-3′. ACTA-forward: 5′-cgagaccacctacaacagcat-3′, ACTA-reverse: 5′-gccaccacccaccttgatct-3′. The ChIP assays against RPC3-3FLAG at AsisI cutting sites are conducted in 239T cells, the primers used in AsisI system are: #1-forward 5′-CCCAACCCTCACTGACACAAGG #1-reverse 5′-TGTCCCCCAACTCCTTCTCATG #2-forward 5′-CTTGCAAATCTGAAGCACCCCA #2-reverse 5′-TTGGGGCCTTGCTTTTCTCATC #3-forward 5′-TGAGTTGGACGTGCCATGTTGT #3-reverse 5′-CTAGGGATAGGCAGCTGATGGTG
2 × 10 5 U2OS GAPDH-I-SceI cells were seeded in 6-well plate. After culture for 12 hr, siRPC1 and siCtr RNA oligos were transfected respectively. 48 hours after siRNA transfection, the I-SceI expression plasmid was transfected. The cells were cultured for additional 24 or 72 hr. The cells were collected for the preparation of genomic DNA. A set of primers that are 240 bp upstream and downstream the I-SceI cut site was used for the amplification of the I-SceI-containing DNA region. The PCR products were purified using QIAGEN column and subjected to DNA sequencing.
For fluorescent analysis, at least twenty cells were analyzed. Fluorescent intensity was measured with the software of “image-J.” For significance analysis, we used two-paired Student’s t tests in Microsoft Excel. ∗ is refers to p < 0.05, ∗∗ is refers to p < 0.01, and ∗∗∗ is refers to p < 0.001. The number of samples used for analysis is listed in the figures or figure legends. The relative increasement of fluorescence of indicated protein was measured by comparing the average fluorescent intensity at laser irradiation region and the average fluorescent intensity in other regions of cell nucleus. The fluorescent intensity was measured by image-J software.
