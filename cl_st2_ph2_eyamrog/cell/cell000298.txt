Title: KCNE1 is an auxiliary subunit of two distinct ion channel superfamilies


Abstract: Summary

Determination of what is the specificity of subunits composing a protein complex is essential when studying gene variants on human pathophysiology. The pore-forming α-subunit KCNQ1, which belongs to the voltage-gated ion channel superfamily, associates to its β-auxiliary subunit KCNE1 to generate the slow cardiac potassium I Ks current, whose dysfunction leads to cardiac arrhythmia. Using pharmacology, gene invalidation, and single-molecule fluorescence assays, we found that KCNE1 fulfils all criteria of a bona fide auxiliary subunit of the TMEM16A chloride channel, which belongs to the anoctamin superfamily. Strikingly, assembly with KCNE1 switches TMEM16A from a calcium-dependent to a voltage-dependent ion channel. Importantly, clinically relevant inherited mutations within the TMEM16A-regulating domain of KCNE1 abolish the TMEM16A modulation, suggesting that the TMEM16A-KCNE1 current may contribute to inherited pathologies. Altogether, these findings challenge the dogma of the specificity of auxiliary subunits regarding protein complexes and questions ion channel classification.

Section: Introduction

KCNE1 is a 129-residue peptide, with a single short hydrophobic membrane spanning domain and carboxy- and amino-terminal domains facing toward the intracellular and extracellular side, respectively ( Takumi et al., 1988 45. Takumi, T. ∙ Ohkubo, H. ∙ Nakanishi, S. Cloning of a membrane protein that induces a slow voltage-gated potassium current Science. 1988; 242 :1042-1045 Crossref Scopus (458) PubMed Google Scholar ). When injected in Xenopus laevis oocytes, KCNE1 produces a slowly activating K + current ( Takumi et al., 1988 45. Takumi, T. ∙ Ohkubo, H. ∙ Nakanishi, S. Cloning of a membrane protein that induces a slow voltage-gated potassium current Science. 1988; 242 :1042-1045 Crossref Scopus (458) PubMed Google Scholar ). For this reason, KCNE1 was initially believed to be the minimal sequence that could encode for a K + channel ( Goldstein and Miller, 1991 18. Goldstein, S.A. ∙ Miller, C. Site-specific mutations in a minimal voltage-dependent K+ channel alter ion selectivity and open-channel block Neuron. 1991; 7 :403-408 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (121) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wang and Goldstein, 1995 51. Wang, K.W. ∙ Goldstein, S.A. Subunit composition of minK potassium channels Neuron. 1995; 14 :1303-1309 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (117) PubMed Google Scholar ). Experiments using other heterologous cell models questioned this finding, because expression of KCNE1 alone is not able to induce current in mammalian cell lines ( Lesage et al., 1993 26. Lesage, F. ∙ Attali, B. ∙ Lakey, J. ... Are Xenopus oocytes unique in displaying functional IsK channel heterologous expression? Receptors Channels. 1993; 1 :143-152 PubMed Google Scholar ). This enigma was resolved by the discovery that Xenopus oocytes express endogenous KCNQ1 channels, which are modulated by KCNE1 ( Barhanin et al., 1996 5. Barhanin, J. ∙ Lesage, F. ∙ Guillemare, E. ... K(V)LQT1 and lsK (minK) proteins associate to form the I(Ks) cardiac potassium current Nature. 1996; 384 :78-80 Crossref Scopus (1424) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sanguinetti et al., 1996 41. Sanguinetti, M.C. ∙ Curran, M.E. ∙ Zou, A. ... Coassembly of K(V)LQT1 and minK (IsK) proteins to form cardiac I(Ks) potassium channel Nature. 1996; 384 :80-83 Crossref Scopus (1554) PubMed Google Scholar ). These experiments showed that KCNE1 does not encode for a pore-forming α-subunit but for an ancillary (β) subunit of the voltage-dependent potassium KCNQ1 channel. Association between KCNQ1 and KCNE1 underlies the slow repolarizing component in the cardiac action potential (I Ks ) ( Barhanin et al., 1996 5. Barhanin, J. ∙ Lesage, F. ∙ Guillemare, E. ... K(V)LQT1 and lsK (minK) proteins associate to form the I(Ks) cardiac potassium current Nature. 1996; 384 :78-80 Crossref Scopus (1424) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sanguinetti et al., 1996 41. Sanguinetti, M.C. ∙ Curran, M.E. ∙ Zou, A. ... Coassembly of K(V)LQT1 and minK (IsK) proteins to form cardiac I(Ks) potassium channel Nature. 1996; 384 :80-83 Crossref Scopus (1554) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition to the K + current described above, a voltage-dependent Cl − current was observed upon injection of cRNA of KCNE1 in Xenopus oocytes ( Attali et al., 1993 4. Attali, B. ∙ Guillemare, E. ∙ Lesage, F. ... The protein IsK is a dual activator of K+ and Cl- channels Nature. 1993; 365 :850-852 Crossref Scopus (123) PubMed Google Scholar ), and up to now, the molecular identity of this current has remained elusive.
Ca 2+ -activated Cl − channels (CaCCs), belonging to the anoctamin protein superfamily, play a major role in cell physiology, including signal transduction, regulation of cardiac and neuronal excitability, epithelial secretion, and muscle contraction, among others ( Hartzell et al., 2005 21. Hartzell, C. ∙ Putzier, I. ∙ Arreola, J. Calcium-activated chloride channels Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2005; 67 :719-758 Crossref Scopus (508) PubMed Google Scholar ; Pedemonte and Galietta, 2014 35. Pedemonte, N. ∙ Galietta, L.J. Structure and function of TMEM16 proteins (anoctamins) Physiol. Rev. 2014; 94 :419-459 Crossref Scopus (390) PubMed Google Scholar ). TMEM16A was the first member of this superfamily to be cloned by three independent laboratories, using different approaches ( Caputo et al., 2008 10. Caputo, A. ∙ Caci, E. ∙ Ferrera, L. ... TMEM16A, a membrane protein associated with calcium-dependent chloride channel activity Science. 2008; 322 :590-594 Crossref Scopus (1068) PubMed Google Scholar ; Schroeder et al., 2008 43.

Ten anoctamin members have been found in mammals, but only TMEM16A and TMEM16B have been demonstrated to be full CaCCs, whereas the rest of the family operates as scramblases that rapidly and bidirectionally translocate lipids maintaining the asymmetry of the plasma membrane ( Falzone et al., 2018 16. Falzone, M.E. ∙ Malvezzi, M. ∙ Lee, B.C. ... Known structures and unknown mechanisms of TMEM16 scramblases and channels J. Gen. Physiol. 2018; 150 :933-947 Crossref Scopus (81) PubMed Google Scholar ; Pedemonte and Galietta, 2014 35. Pedemonte, N. ∙ Galietta, L.J. Structure and function of TMEM16 proteins (anoctamins) Physiol. Rev. 2014; 94 :419-459 Crossref Scopus (390) PubMed Google Scholar ). The structure of TMEM16A has been recently elucidated, defining the channel as a homodimer constituted of ten transmembrane domains per subunit ( Dang et al., 2017 14. Dang, S. ∙ Feng, S. ∙ Tien, J. ... Cryo-EM structures of the TMEM16A calcium-activated chloride channel Nature. 2017; 552 :426-429 Crossref Scopus (227) PubMed Google Scholar ; Peters et al., 2018 36. Peters, C.J. ∙ Gilchrist, J.M. ∙ Tien, J. ... The Sixth Transmembrane Segment Is a Major Gating Component of the TMEM16A Calcium-Activated Chloride Channel Neuron. 2018; 97 :1063-1077 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar ). TMEM16A represents the major chloride channel in Xenopus oocytes ( Schroeder et al., 2008 43. Schroeder, B.C. ∙ Cheng, T. ∙ Jan, Y.N. ... Expression cloning of TMEM16A as a calcium-activated chloride channel subunit Cell. 2008; 134 :1019-1029 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (978) PubMed Google Scholar ), where it mediates fast polyspermy block ( Wozniak et al., 2018 53. Wozniak, K.L. ∙ Phelps, W.A. ∙ Tembo, M. ... The TMEM16A channel mediates the fast polyspermy block in Xenopus laevis J. Gen. Physiol. 2018; 150 :1249-1259 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ). Nevertheless, no β-subunit has been identified for this channel up to now.
Because of its high expression in Xenopus oocytes ( Schroeder et al., 2008 43. Schroeder, B.C. ∙ Cheng, T. ∙ Jan, Y.N. ... Expression cloning of TMEM16A as a calcium-activated chloride channel subunit Cell. 2008; 134 :1019-1029 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (978) PubMed Google Scholar ), we hypothesize in the present manuscript that KCNE1 may serve as a β-subunit of the pore-forming TMEM16A α-subunits to induce the voltage-gated Cl − current, which was described almost 30 years ago ( Attali et al., 1993 4. Attali, B. ∙ Guillemare, E. ∙ Lesage, F. ... The protein IsK is a dual activator of K+ and Cl- channels Nature. 1993; 365 :850-852 Crossref Scopus (123) PubMed Google Scholar ). We demonstrate here that KCNE1 interacts physically with TMEM16A with a 2α:2β stoichiometry using electrophysiology in heterologous and native systems and single molecule pull-down assays. This interaction induces a sustained voltage-dependent chloride current in the absence of elevated cytoplasmic Ca 2+ , which, physiologically, responds to the blood pressure regulating renin-angiotensin system in proximal tubule cells. Importantly, we find that clinically relevant inherited polymorphisms within the KCNE1-regulating domain, including the common S38G polymorphism, abolish the KCNE1-dependent regulation of TMEM16A, indicating that this current may contribute to inherited pathologies such as cardiac arrhythmia. Our results demonstrate that KCNE1 fulfils all criteria of an auxiliary subunit of chloride channels. Therefore, KCNE1 associates with and modulates two distinct classes of protein superfamilies: the voltage-gated ion channels and the anoctamins. This finding should be considered when analyzing functional impacts of KCNE1 gene variants on human pathophysiology.

Section: Results

To test the ability of KCNE1 to regulate TMEM16A, we used the heterologous HEK293T cell model, which expresses neither TMEM16A nor KCNE1 endogenously. Whereas transfection of HEK293T cells with either TMEM16A or KCNE1 alone produced no significant current, co-expression of both proteins induced a voltage-dependent current, whose density was of 18.1 ± 2.8 pA/pF at +100 mV ( Figures 1 A and 1B). The reversal potential was −4.8 ± 1.3 mV, which is similar to the expected reversal Cl − potential in the experimental conditions used. This chloride current was inhibited by niflumic acid (NFA), T16Ainh-A01 ( Davis et al., 2013 15. Davis, A.J. ∙ Shi, J. ∙ Pritchard, H.A. ... Potent vasorelaxant activity of the TMEM16A inhibitor T16A(inh) -A01 Br. J. Pharmacol. 2013; 168 :773-784 Crossref Scopus (81) PubMed Google Scholar ), and also by Ani9, the most specific TMEM16A inhibitor ( Seo et al., 2016 44. Seo, Y. ∙ Lee, H.K. ∙ Park, J. ... Ani9, A Novel Potent Small-Molecule ANO1 Inhibitor with Negligible Effect on ANO2 PLoS ONE. 2016; 11 :e0155771 Crossref Scopus (137) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figures 1 C and 1D). As expected, the TMEM16A-KCNE1 current presented higher permeability for large anions with lower hydration energy, as it has been shown before for TMEM16A alone in the presence of calcium ( Table S1 ; Caputo et al., 2008 10. Caputo, A. ∙ Caci, E. ∙ Ferrera, L. ... TMEM16A, a membrane protein associated with calcium-dependent chloride channel activity Science. 2008; 322 :590-594 Crossref Scopus (1068) PubMed Google Scholar ; Schroeder et al., 2008 43. Schroeder, B.C. ∙ Cheng, T. ∙ Jan, Y.N. ... Expression cloning of TMEM16A as a calcium-activated chloride channel subunit Cell. 2008; 134 :1019-1029 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (978) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yang et al., 2008 56. Yang, Y.D. ∙ Cho, H. ∙ Koo, J.Y. ... TMEM16A confers receptor-activated calcium-dependent chloride conductance Nature. 2008; 455 :1210-1215 Crossref Scopus (1096) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, the channel does not become cation permeable, because replacement of the external solution by a 15 mM NaCl solution supplemented with D-mannitol allowed us to determine a P Na /P Cl of ∼0.1. This value is consistent with the calculated prediction through the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation in our conditions (see Equation 1 in the STAR methods ) and similar to the reported value ( Yang et al., 2008 56. Yang, Y.D. ∙ Cho, H. ∙ Koo, J.Y. ... TMEM16A confers receptor-activated calcium-dependent chloride conductance Nature. 2008; 455 :1210-1215 Crossref Scopus (1096) PubMed Google Scholar ; Peters et al., 2018 36. Peters, C.J. ∙ Gilchrist, J.M. ∙ Tien, J. ... The Sixth Transmembrane Segment Is a Major Gating Component of the TMEM16A Calcium-Activated Chloride Channel Neuron. 2018; 97 :1063-1077 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar ). This suggests that KCNE1 switches TMEM16A from a calcium-dependent to a voltage-dependent chloride channel.
To preclude the possibility that KCNE1 activates endogenous calcium channels, we conducted similar experiments in the presence of the fast calcium chelator BAPTA ( Figures 1 E and 1F). As shown in Figure 1 F, BAPTA did not affect the voltage-dependent current evoked by the TMEM16A-KCNE1 complex. To rule out a potential modulation of endogenous calcium channels by KCNE1 leading to TMEM16A activation, we co-expressed KCNE1 with the Ca 2+ -activated SK4 channel, which has a similar calcium sensitivity as TMEM16A ( Cao and Houamed, 1999 9. Cao, Y.J. ∙ Houamed, K.M. Activation of recombinant human SK4 channels by metal cations FEBS Lett. 1999; 446 :137-141 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ). KCNE1 overexpression did not induce any increase of the SK4 current in the absence of calcium ( Figures 1 G and 1H). Altogether, these results exclude an implication of intracellular Ca 2+ in the KCNE1-induced and voltage-dependent activation of TMEM16A.
TMEM16A does not have any obvious classical voltage-sensor domains, but several cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains have been shown to be implicated in its regulation by voltage, including the first intracellular loop ( Xiao et al., 2011 54. Xiao, Q. ∙ Yu, K. ∙ Perez-Cornejo, P. ... Voltage- and calcium-dependent gating of TMEM16A/Ano1 chloride channels are physically coupled by the first intracellular loop Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108 :8891-8896 Crossref Scopus (182) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the sixth transmembrane domain (TM6) ( Peters et al., 2018 36. Peters, C.J. ∙ Gilchrist, J.M. ∙ Tien, J. ... The Sixth Transmembrane Segment Is a Major Gating Component of the TMEM16A Calcium-Activated Chloride Channel Neuron. 2018; 97 :1063-1077 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar ). To determine which domain is involved in the KCNE1-induced voltage-gating of the channel, we first tested the effect of KCNE1 on the mutation 444 EEEE 447 / 444 AAAA 447 that is known to abolish the intrinsic TMEM16A voltage-dependence ( Xiao et al., 2011 54. Xiao, Q. ∙ Yu, K. ∙ Perez-Cornejo, P. ... Voltage- and calcium-dependent gating of TMEM16A/Ano1 chloride channels are physically coupled by the first intracellular loop Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108 :8891-8896 Crossref Scopus (182) PubMed Google Scholar ). The mutation 444 EEEE 447 / 444 AAAA 447 did not prevent channel regulation by KCNE1, ruling out the hypothesis that KCNE1 modifies the gating of TMEM16A by acting on the intrinsic voltage-dependence linked to this domain ( Figure S1 ). We then tested the role of the TMEM16A TM6 domain using two TMEM16A mutants bearing the TM6 mutations I637A and Q645A, which enable the channel to be activated in the absence of calcium ( Peters et al., 2018 36. Peters, C.J. ∙ Gilchrist, J.M. ∙ Tien, J. ... The Sixth Transmembrane Segment Is a Major Gating Component of the TMEM16A Calcium-Activated Chloride Channel Neuron. 2018; 97 :1063-1077 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar ). As expected, these two mutants produced current in the absence of elevated Ca 2+ , but no additional effect was observed upon co-expression of KCNE1 ( Figures 2 A–2C). The absence of an additive effect strongly supports the idea that KCNE1 modulates channel gating by acting on the TM6 conformation. This conformation mimics a single Ca 2+ occupancy state as it has been demonstrated for both mutations ( Figures 2 B and 2C; Peters et al., 2018 36. Peters, C.J. ∙ Gilchrist, J.M. ∙ Tien, J. ... The Sixth Transmembrane Segment Is a Major Gating Component of the TMEM16A Calcium-Activated Chloride Channel Neuron. 2018; 97 :1063-1077 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar ). Supporting this, we found that the conductance versus Vm curve observed for TMEM16A + KCNE1 overlaps with the curve obtained with TMEM16A alone at moderate calcium concentrations (0.5 μM) ( Figure 2 D). Despite of their ability to enable channel activation in the absence of calcium, the TM6 I637A and Q645A mutants are still modulated by Ca 2+ ( Peters et al., 2018 36. Peters, C.J. ∙ Gilchrist, J.M. ∙ Tien, J. ... The Sixth Transmembrane Segment Is a Major Gating Component of the TMEM16A Calcium-Activated Chloride Channel Neuron. 2018; 97 :1063-1077 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, we assessed the calcium sensitivity of the TMEM16A-KCNE1 current. Similarly to both mutants, TMEM16A-KCNE1 presented a calcium sensitivity ( Figures 2 E, 2F, and S2 ) reinforcing the idea that KCNE1 modulates channel gating by acting on the TM6 conformation. We also evaluated the impact of KCNE1 co-expression on channel density and found that there was no effect of KCNE1 on it. In fact, at saturating calcium concentrations no difference in current densities was observed between cells expressing TMEM16A alone and TMEM16A + KCNE1 ( Figure 2 F).
To be considered as an auxiliary subunit, a protein has to interact directly and stably with the α-subunits. To test the physical association between KCNE1 and TMEM16A, we used the recently developed single molecule pull-down (SiMPull) assay ( Jain et al., 2011 23. Jain, A. ∙ Liu, R. ∙ Ramani, B. ... Probing cellular protein complexes using single-molecule pull-down Nature. 2011; 473 :484-488 Crossref Scopus (337) PubMed Google Scholar ; Levitz et al., 2016 27. Levitz, J. ∙ Royal, P. ∙ Comoglio, Y. ... Heterodimerization within the TREK channel subfamily produces a diverse family of highly regulated potassium channels Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113 :4194-4199 Crossref Scopus (59) PubMed Google Scholar ; Royal et al., 2019 38. Royal, P. ∙ Andres-Bilbe, A. ∙ Ávalos Prado, P. ... Migraine-Associated TRESK Mutations Increase Neuronal Excitability through Alternative Translation Initiation and Inhibition of TREK Neuron. 2019; 101 :232-245 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (87) PubMed Google Scholar ). By direct visualization of antibody-immobilized protein complexes ( Figures 3 A and 3E), this technique allows one to determine the composition and stoichiometry within single protein complexes by counting fluorophore bleaching ( Jain et al., 2011 23. Jain, A. ∙ Liu, R. ∙ Ramani, B. ... Probing cellular protein complexes using single-molecule pull-down Nature. 2011; 473 :484-488 Crossref Scopus (337) PubMed Google Scholar ; Levitz et al., 2016 27.

USA. 2016; 113 :4194-4199 Crossref Scopus (59) PubMed Google Scholar ; Royal et al., 2019 38. Royal, P. ∙ Andres-Bilbe, A. ∙ Ávalos Prado, P. ... Migraine-Associated TRESK Mutations Increase Neuronal Excitability through Alternative Translation Initiation and Inhibition of TREK Neuron. 2019; 101 :232-245 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (87) PubMed Google Scholar ). After co-transfection with the two putative partners KCNE1 and TMEM16A, one of them fused to an HA affinity tag and the other to a GFP label, and subsequent pull-down, we observed many fluorescent spots for both conditions, TMEM16A-GFP + HA-KCNE1 ( Figure 3 B) and KCNE1-GFP + HA-TMEM16A ( Figure 3 F). This demonstrates a physical interaction between KCNE1 and TMEM16A. Importantly, when HA-KCNE1 or HA-TMEM16A were not co-expressed, no proteins fused to GFP were isolated ( Figures 3 I–3L), confirming the specificity of the HA-antibody that we used in our SiMPull assays. By analyzing bleaching steps for immobilized HA-KCNE1-TMEM16A-GFP complexes, we were able to determine the number of TMEM16A-GFP subunits within the complex. We found that the majority of fluorescence intensity trajectories showed two-step bleaching (∼70%), with the remaining spots bleaching in one step (∼20%) or occasionally three steps (∼10%) ( Figures 3 C and 3D). This distribution agrees well with the binomial distribution predicted for a strict dimer based on an estimated GFP maturation probability of ∼75% ( Ulbrich and Isacoff, 2007 47. Ulbrich, M.H. ∙ Isacoff, E.Y. Subunit counting in membrane-bound proteins Nat. Methods. 2007; 4 :319-321 Crossref Scopus (563) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zacharias et al., 2002 58. Zacharias, D.A. ∙ Violin, J.D. ∙ Newton, A.C. ... Partitioning of lipid-modified monomeric GFPs into membrane microdomains of live cells Science. 2002; 296 :913-916 Crossref Scopus (1860) PubMed Google Scholar ). Analysis of the SiMPull experiment with HA-TMEM16A-KCNE1-GFP showed that most complexes presented two bleaching steps (∼65%) and some remaining spots bleached in one (∼25%) and three steps (∼10%) ( Figures 3 G and 3H). This distribution corresponds to the presence of two KCNE1-GFP subunits within the protein complex. Therefore, two KCNE1 subunits assemble with two TMEM16A subunits ( Dang et al., 2017 14. Dang, S. ∙ Feng, S. ∙ Tien, J. ...

Cloning of a membrane protein that induces a slow voltage-gated potassium current Science. 1988; 242 :1042-1045 Crossref Scopus (458) PubMed Google Scholar ), following a 2α:2β stoichiometry.
The anoctamin family is constituted of ten members, but only TMEM16A and TMEM16B have been demonstrated to be full CaCCs ( Schroeder et al., 2008 43. Schroeder, B.C. ∙ Cheng, T. ∙ Jan, Y.N. ... Expression cloning of TMEM16A as a calcium-activated chloride channel subunit Cell. 2008; 134 :1019-1029 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (978) PubMed Google Scholar ). We assessed the ability of the KCNE1 to modulate the TMEM16B current. Co-expression of TMEM16B with KCNE1 did not induce any chloride current at rest, nor did any other KCNE subunit ( Figure S3 A). The KCNE family comprises five members that show a similar structure despite their low homology ( Crump and Abbott, 2014 13. Crump, S.M. ∙ Abbott, G.W. Arrhythmogenic KCNE gene variants: current knowledge and future challenges Front. Genet. 2014; 5 :3 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ). The different members of this family have been found to differently regulate the KCNQ1 channel ( Bendahhou et al., 2005 7. Bendahhou, S. ∙ Marionneau, C. ∙ Haurogne, K. ... In vitro molecular interactions and distribution of KCNE family with KCNQ1 in the human heart Cardiovasc. Res. 2005; 67 :529-538 Crossref Scopus (124) PubMed Google Scholar ). We studied TMEM16A regulation by the different KCNE subunits and observed that, as demonstrated for KCNE1, only KCNE5 was able to induce a sustained chloride current in the absence of intracellular elevation of Ca 2+ ( Figures S3 B and S3C). KCNE5 was also found to interact with TMEM16A at the single molecule level ( Figures S3 D and S3E).
To be considered as a bona fide auxiliary subunit, the protein must interact with the alpha subunits in a native environment. To confirm that KCNE1 is an auxiliary subunit of TMEM16A in native tissue and to eliminate possible artifacts due to heterologous overexpression, we took advantage of kidney proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) cells obtained from wild-type and kcne1 knockout (KO) mice ( Barrière et al., 2003 6. Barrière, H. ∙ Rubera, I. ∙ Belfodil, R. ... Swelling-activated chloride and potassium conductance in primary cultures of mouse proximal tubules. Implication of KCNE1 protein J. Membr. Biol. 2003; 193 :153-170 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ). PCT cells are considered as a relevant model as they naturally co-express both TMEM16A and KCNE1 ( Faria et al., 2014 17. Faria, D. ∙ Rock, J.R. ∙ Romao, A.M. ...

Nephrol. 2001; 12 :2003-2011 PubMed Google Scholar ) and do not necessitate any genetic manipulation to record TMEM16A currents. Moreover, while no modification of the K + current was found in PCT cells from kcne1 KO mice compared to wild-type, a DIDS (4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid)-sensitive Cl − conductance was impaired ( Barrière et al., 2003 6. Barrière, H. ∙ Rubera, I. ∙ Belfodil, R. ... Swelling-activated chloride and potassium conductance in primary cultures of mouse proximal tubules. Implication of KCNE1 protein J. Membr. Biol. 2003; 193 :153-170 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ). We confirmed the loss of current, whose reversal potential was similar to the expected Cl − reversal potential in kcne1 null PCT cells (18.07 ± 1.21 pA/pF versus 5.37 ± 0.56 pA/pF for PCT cells from wild-type and KO mice, respectively) ( Figure 4 A). This current was inhibited by NFA (4.51 ± 0.28 pA/pF), T16Ainh-A01 (5.52 ± 0.72 pA/pF), and Ani9 (2.88 ± 0.38 pA/pF) ( Figures 4 B–4D).

Chem. 2017; 292 :9164-9174 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ) in wild-type PCT cells significantly reduced the Cl − current amplitude (4.23 ± 0.48 pA/pF) ( Figure 4 E). This demonstrates the involvement of TMEM16A subunits in the channel complex responsible for the herein studied Cl − current. A rescue experiment by KCNE1 transfection of kcne1 −/− cells fully restored the voltage-dependent Cl − current (21.59 ± 1.38 pA/pF) ( Figure 4 F), showing that the absence of chloride current in these cells was only due to the KO of kcne1 and not due to any modification that might occur during the culture process.
Both kcne1 −/− and tmem16a −/− mice exhibit an increased hematocrit value and dehydration due to enhanced water loss ( Vallon et al., 2001 48. Vallon, V. ∙ Grahammer, F. ∙ Richter, K. ...

In the renal proximal tubule, these processes are regulated by the renin-angiotensin system that activates AT1R leading to PKC pathway stimulation. This pathway increases Na + transport through activation of the apical Na + /H + exchanger 3 (NHE3) ( Harris and Young, 1977 20. Harris, P.J. ∙ Young, J.A.

Renal proximal tubule angiotensin AT1A receptors regulate blood pressure Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2011; 301 :R1067-R1077 Crossref Scopus (73) PubMed Google Scholar ). To keep the electroneutrality, Na + transport needs notably Cl − as a counter ion. We hypothesized that the KCNE1-TMEM16A channels may carry this Cl − current
Application of angiotensin II (AngII), the natural ligand of angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1R), on wild-type PCT cells led to an ∼3-fold increase in chloride current with a reversal potential that was similar to the expected Cl − reversal potential ( Figure 5 A). AngII application on kcne1 −/− PCT cells failed to produce any current increase (6.5 ± 0.6 pA/pF versus 6.6 ± 1.1 pA/pF, p > 0.9) ( Figure 5 B), demonstrating that this AngII-induced chloride current is dependent on KCNE1. Moreover, knock down of TMEM16A by siRNA transfection ( Sala-Rabanal et al., 2017 39. Sala-Rabanal, M. ∙ Yurtsever, Z. ∙ Berry, K.N. ... Modulation of TMEM16A channel activity by the von Willebrand factor type A (VWA) domain of the calcium-activated chloride channel regulator 1 (CLCA1) J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292 :9164-9174 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ) in wild-type PCT cells prevented this Cl − current increase (9.21 ± 1.07 pA/pF versus 10.03 ± 1.1 pA/pF) ( Figure 5 C), and Ani9 application fully inhibited it (68.69 ± 8.77 versus 8.92 ± 1.25 pA/pF) ( Figure 5 D). Together, this demonstrates that the Cl − current enhanced by AngII is dependent on KCNE1 and is carried by TMEM16A, showing an endogenous role for the KCNE1-TMEM16A channel in the renin-angiotensin system.
In the proximal tubule, AT1R has been shown to couple to protein kinase A (PKA) ( Crajoinas et al., 2016 12. Crajoinas, R.O. ∙ Polidoro, J.Z. ∙ Carneiro de Morais, C.P. ... Angiotensin II counteracts the effects of cAMP/PKA on NHE3 activity and phosphorylation in proximal tubule cells Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2016; 311 :C768-C776 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ) and protein kinase C (PKC) ( Lara et al., 2008 25. Lara, L.S. ∙ Correa, J.S. ∙ Lavelle, A.B. ... The angiotensin receptor type 1-Gq protein-phosphatidyl inositol phospholipase Cbeta-protein kinase C pathway is involved in activation of proximal tubule Na+-ATPase activity by angiotensin(1-7) in pig kidneys Exp. Physiol. 2008; 93 :639-647 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ) pathways. As shown in Figure S4 A, application of the PKA agonist 8-(4-chlorophenylthio) adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (CPT-cAMP) on wild-type PCT cells did not alter the Cl − current (21.60 ± 3.03 pA/pF versus 19.69 ± 2.03 pA/pF, p > 0.5), whereas phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), a PKC agonist, led to a similar Cl − current increase as observed for AT1R activation (27.13 ± 2.04 pA/pF versus 83.47 ± 14.81 pA/pF) ( Figure S4 B). This indicates that AT1R activates the PKC pathway to enhance the KCNE1-TMEM16A current. Moreover, this regulation is KCNE1-dependent, because kcne1 −/− PCT cells did not respond to PMA (5.59 ± 1.14 pA/pF versus 9.19 ± 1.97 pA/pF, p > 0.1) ( Figure S4 C), because it was also seen for AngII.
To address how KCNE1 confers the ability of TMEM16A to be activated by AngII through PKC pathway, we reconstituted the system in HEK293T cells. First, we validated the model: AngII did not modify the TMEM16A current when co-expressed with AT1R alone ( Figure S5 A) but induced an ∼2.5-fold increase of the TMEM16A-KCNE1 chloride current on cells co-expressing KCNE1-TMEM16A and AT1R ( Figure S5 B). As observed in PCT cells, PMA, but not CPT-cAMP, induced an ∼3-fold increase of the TMEM16A-KCNE1 chloride current (20.31 ± 3.31 versus 63.12 ± 10.39 pA/pF) ( Figures S5 C and S5D), confirming an involvement of PKC. Substitution of the KCNE1-serine S102, a known PKC-targeted residue ( Kanda et al., 2011 24. Kanda, V.A. ∙ Purtell, K. ∙ Abbott, G.W. Protein kinase C downregulates I(Ks) by stimulating KCNQ1-KCNE1 potassium channel endocytosis Heart Rhythm. 2011; 8 :1641-1647 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ; Xu et al., 2009 55.

Res. 2009; 82 :430-438 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ), by an alanine abolished the regulation of the channel by AT1R and PKC ( Figures S5 E and S5F). Therefore, it is the phosphorylation of KCNE1 at residue S102 that promotes the TMEM16A-KCNE1 current following AT1R and PKC activation. Furthermore, replacement of S102 by an aspartate residue, mimicking a phosphorylated serine ( Kanda et al., 2011 24. Kanda, V.A. ∙ Purtell, K. ∙ Abbott, G.W. Protein kinase C downregulates I(Ks) by stimulating KCNQ1-KCNE1 potassium channel endocytosis Heart Rhythm. 2011; 8 :1641-1647 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ; Xu et al., 2009 55.

Res. 2009; 82 :430-438 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ), induced an ∼3.5-fold increase of the current (20.31 ± 3.31 versus 74.88 ± 24.38 pA/pF) ( Figure S5 G) similar to the current increase induced by either PKC or AT1R activation, confirming the pivotal role of KCNE1-S102 phosphorylation in the TMEM16A-KCNE1 chloride current regulation. These data demonstrate that in addition to the modification of channel gating, KCNE1 brings a regulation to TMEM16A by AT1R through PKC activation.
KCNE1 is a single transmembrane protein with an extracellular N-terminal domain and a C-terminal domain within the cytosol ( Takumi et al., 1988 45. Takumi, T. ∙ Ohkubo, H. ∙ Nakanishi, S. Cloning of a membrane protein that induces a slow voltage-gated potassium current Science. 1988; 242 :1042-1045 Crossref Scopus (458) PubMed Google Scholar ). To determine the interacting site with TMEM16A, we produced a series of truncated KCNE1 forms ( Figure 6 A) and tested them for their ability to regulate TMEM16A. Truncation of the KCNE1 C-terminal domain (the last 80 residues of the C terminus) did not abolish the KCNE1-mediated TMEM16A regulation (25.04 ± 4.9 pA/pF, p > 0.15) ( Figure 6 B). By contrast, deletion of the full N-terminal domain suppressed the ability of KCNE1 to regulate TMEM16A (6.56 ± 0.89 pA/pF) ( Figure 6 B). No effect was observed for the partial N-terminal truncations, neither for ΔNt16 (25.43 ± 4.46 pA/pF) nor for ΔNt30 (25.23 ± 6.62 pA/pF) ( Figure 6 C). This demonstrates that the domain essential for TMEM16A activation is included in the sequence of the 13 residues preceding the transmembrane domain from L30 to L42. This result is in line with the previous observation, that a partial deletion of KCNE1, including eight of the 13 amino acids of this sequence (KCNE1Δ 11–38 ), abolished the KCNE1-induced chloride current in Xenopus oocytes ( Attali et al., 1993 4. Attali, B. ∙ Guillemare, E. ∙ Lesage, F. ... The protein IsK is a dual activator of K+ and Cl- channels Nature. 1993; 365 :850-852 Crossref Scopus (123) PubMed Google Scholar ). To check if this small domain is sufficient to recapitulate the properties of the entire KCNE1 on the TMEM16A current, we used a corresponding synthetic peptide (Nter13), bearing the L30–L42 sequence. In HEK293T cells only expressing TMEM16A, application of 100 μM Nter13 elicited an Ani9-sensitive current (15.48 ± 3.25 pA/pF) ( Figures 6 D, S6 A, and S6B). Again, the reversal potential was similar to the current observed when the full KCNE1 is co-expressed, whereas no effect was observed by application of a scrambled peptide ( Figure 6 D).
Previous works have identified two common KCNE1 polymorphisms, S38G and R32H, within the 13-residue extracellular domain. Although these polymorphisms may be related to cardiac arrhythmia, they do not or just weakly affect the cardiac I Ks current generated by KCNE1-KCNQ1 ( Crump and Abbott, 2014 13. Crump, S.M. ∙ Abbott, G.W. Arrhythmogenic KCNE gene variants: current knowledge and future challenges Front. Genet. 2014; 5 :3 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ; Westenskow et al., 2004 52.

Mutation in KCNE1 associated to early repolarization syndrome by modulation of slowly activating delayed rectifier K + current Exp. Cell Res. 2018; 363 :315-320 Crossref Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ). We therefore tested the potential of these two KCNE1 variants to regulate TMEM16A. The disease-related mutation T7I, which does not belong to the regulating 13-residue domain, was used as a control. Whereas mutation T7I did not alter the KCNE1-dependent regulation of TMEM16A (24.69 ± 1.57 pA/pF) ( Figures 7 C and 7D), both R32H and S38G mutations abolished the ability of KCNE1 to modulate the TMEM16A current properties (5.69 ± 1.18 pA/pF and 6.96 ± 0.78 pA/pF for R32H and S38G) ( Figures 7 C and 7D). This finding suggests a potential role of the KCNE1-TMEM16A complex in human diseases.

Section: Discussion

Most ion channels are assembled as complexes of a pore-forming α-subunit, associated with auxiliary (β) subunits. In this study, we demonstrate that KCNE1, classically considered as a β-subunit of the cardiac KCNQ1 pore-forming subunit belonging to the voltage-dependent K v channel superfamily, also serves as an auxiliary subunit of the anoctamin superfamily channel TMEM16A, a Ca 2+ -activated Cl − channel (CaCC). By stably interacting with TMEM16A following a 2α:2β stoichiometry, KCNE1 induces a voltage-dependent current in the absence of intracellular elevation of calcium. Furthermore, we show that the presence of KCNE1 in the TMEM16A channel complex is essential for the dynamic regulation by the blood pressure-regulating renin-angiotensin system in proximal tubule cells. KCNE1 polymorphisms within the TMEM16A-interacting domain abolish its ability to regulate TMEM16A, suggesting a possible implication of this voltage-dependent chloride current in human diseases.
β-subunits of ion channels are important molecular players providing a source of electrical signaling diversity in cells. Although they cannot induce native currents per se, they associate with pore-forming subunits of ion channels and modulate their pharmacological and biophysical characteristics. Their physiological importance is reflected by the large number of diseases linked to their mutations, such as muscular pathologies, epilepsy, and cardiac arrhythmias ( Adelman, 1995 1. Adelman, J.P.

KCNE1 is a famous example of a K v β-subunit, which associates with KCNQ1 and hERG to control both I Ks and I Kr components of the cardiac action potential. More than sixty KCNE1 gene variants have been reported to be associated with human diseases, particularly with cardiac arrhythmias ( Barhanin et al., 1996 5.

Coassembly of K(V)LQT1 and minK (IsK) proteins to form cardiac I(Ks) potassium channel Nature. 1996; 384 :80-83 Crossref Scopus (1554) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cross-modulation by β-subunits of pore-forming α-subunits from the same superfamily of ion channels was shown for Na v and K v channels ( Marionneau et al., 2012 29. Marionneau, C. ∙ Carrasquillo, Y. ∙ Norris, A.J. ... The sodium channel accessory subunit Navβ1 regulates neuronal excitability through modulation of repolarizing voltage-gated K + channels J.

Modulation of voltage-gated K+ channels by the sodium channel β1 subunit Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109 :18577-18582 Crossref Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ). Na v β 1 coordinates the control of K v and Na v channels, which derivate from the same ancestor ( Moran et al., 2015 30. Moran, Y. ∙ Barzilai, M.G. ∙ Liebeskind, B.J. ... Evolution of voltage-gated ion channels at the emergence of Metazoa J. Exp. Biol. 2015; 218 :515-525 Crossref Scopus (105) PubMed Google Scholar ) and belong to the superfamily of voltage-gated ion channels. Our results demonstrate auxiliary subunit-cross-modulation of two different superfamilies, which are phylogenetically not related: the voltage-gated channels and the anoctamins.
This cross-regulation concerns not only the KCNE member 1 of the KCNE subunit family, but also the KCNE member 5. Despite the fact that we did not find a significant alignment of the KCNE1’s 13 residues sequence in the KCNE5 sequence, both subunits interact with TMEM16A and both seem to have a similar activating effect on the Cl − current. A similar effect does not necessarily mean an identical mode of action and it is possible that they differ in their manner to regulate TMEM16A. This has been already described for K v channel regulation by the different KCNE members. For instance, both KCNE4 and KCNE5 provoke the same inhibition of KCNQ1 channels, but whereas KCNE4 inhibits the binding of the channel activator calmodulin, KCNE5 shifts the voltage-dependence of KCNQ1 toward highly depolarized potentials ( Angelo et al., 2002 2. Angelo, K. ∙ Jespersen, T. ∙ Grunnet, M. ... KCNE5 induces time- and voltage-dependent modulation of the KCNQ1 current Biophys.

Chem. 2011; 286 :4141-4149 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ) rendering the channel non-functional at physiological potentials. Future studies will aim to fully characterize these regulations and interactions between KCNE and TMEM16 members. Our results demonstrate auxiliary subunit-cross-modulation of two different superfamilies, which are phylogenetically not related: the voltage-gated channels and the anoctamins.
We found that, by interacting with TMEM16A, KCNE1 modifies the gating of this anoctamin member, switching it from a calcium-dependent to a voltage-dependent channel. Our experiments with different Ca 2+ chelators and with the Ca 2+ -activated SK4 channel as a very sensitive reporter demonstrated that activation of this CaCC is independent from any rise of cytosolic Ca 2+ , the natural activator of the channel in the absence of KCNE1 ( Caputo et al., 2008 10.

We also discarded a potential increase of cell surface expression of TMEM16A when KCNE1 is present. An absent current density increase at a saturating Ca 2+ concentration in the presence of KCNE1 shows that this protein does not stabilize the channel at the cell surface, as it was previously described for CLCA1 ( Sala-Rabanal et al., 2017 39. Sala-Rabanal, M. ∙ Yurtsever, Z. ∙ Berry, K.N. ... Modulation of TMEM16A channel activity by the von Willebrand factor type A (VWA) domain of the calcium-activated chloride channel regulator 1 (CLCA1) J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292 :9164-9174 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ), but rather modifies channel gating. Recently, the TMEM16A-TM6 segment was reported to play a crucial role in voltage and calcium sensing ( Peters et al., 2018 36. Peters, C.J. ∙ Gilchrist, J.M. ∙ Tien, J. ... The Sixth Transmembrane Segment Is a Major Gating Component of the TMEM16A Calcium-Activated Chloride Channel Neuron. 2018; 97 :1063-1077 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar ). The TM6 was shown to be flexible allowing it to adopt several stable conformations that would condition the channel activity mode. Its key function was demonstrated by showing that two mutations within the TM6 (I637A and Q645A) enable channel activation by membrane depolarization in the absence of calcium, as KCNE1 does ( Peters et al., 2018 36. Peters, C.J. ∙ Gilchrist, J.M. ∙ Tien, J. ... The Sixth Transmembrane Segment Is a Major Gating Component of the TMEM16A Calcium-Activated Chloride Channel Neuron. 2018; 97 :1063-1077 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar ). The absence of an additive effect of KCNE1 when co-expressed with the two TM6 mutants supports an overlapping mechanism. KCNE1 may modulate channel activity by modifying the TM6 conformation, placing the channel in a voltage-dependent mode and enabling the channel to be activated independently of Ca 2+ . Clearly, the voltage-dependent chloride channel superfamily is not restricted to the ClC family, but extends to the anoctamin family when combined with KCNE1. This also shows that the difference between Ca 2+ and voltage-dependent channels is not strict and that we should rather consider a continuum of biophysical properties.
Whereas the KCNQ1-KCNE1 stoichiometry remains a matter of debate ( Morin and Kobertz, 2008 31. Morin, T.J. ∙ Kobertz, W.R.

Individual IKs channels at the surface of mammalian cells contain two KCNE1 accessory subunits Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111 :E1438-E1446 Crossref Scopus (69) PubMed Google Scholar ), we found that the TMEM16A-KCNE1 complex is composed of 2α:2β subunits by using the SiMPull assay. We have shown that this complex is formed in HEK cells upon heterologous expression, but we also demonstrated its presence in native kidney cells, where it mediates a Cl − conductance that is sensitive to TMEM16A inhibitors. This Cl − conductance cannot be recorded in KCNE1 KO cells or in cells in which TMEM16A has been knocked down, and it is rescued in these cells by KCNE1 re-expression upon transfection. The TMEM16A-KCNE1 channel may participate in the volume regulation of PCT cells, as the regulatory volume decrease (RVD) typically observed after a hypo-osmotic shock in cells issued from kcne1 −/− mice is reduced ( Barrière et al., 2003 6. Barrière, H. ∙ Rubera, I. ∙ Belfodil, R. ... Swelling-activated chloride and potassium conductance in primary cultures of mouse proximal tubules. Implication of KCNE1 protein J. Membr. Biol. 2003; 193 :153-170 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ). This lack of RVD was attributed to the loss of a chloride conductance and not to the loss of the KCNQ1-KCNE1 K + current, as it was anticipated at that time. At the whole animal level, kcne1 −/− and tmem16a −/− mice exhibit similar phenotypes such as an increased hematocrit value and dehydration due to enhanced water loss ( Vallon et al., 2001 48. Vallon, V. ∙ Grahammer, F. ∙ Richter, K. ... Role of KCNE1-dependent K+ fluxes in mouse proximal tubule J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2001; 12 :2003-2011 PubMed Google Scholar ; Faria et al., 2014 17. Faria, D. ∙ Rock, J.R. ∙ Romao, A.M. ... The calcium-activated chloride channel Anoctamin 1 contributes to the regulation of renal function Kidney Int. 2014; 85 :1369-1381 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ). The renin-angiotensin system is involved in blood pressure regulation by notably increasing water and salt reabsorption through activation of AT1R, enhancing the transport of Na + and its counter ion Cl − . In line with this, our results demonstrate that the KCNE1-TMEM16A chloride current in proximal tubule cells increases upon activation of the renin-angiotensin system. This indicates that the KCNE1-TMEM16A chloride current is, at least partially, the AngII-dependent Cl − KCNE1-TMEM16A current, in which TMEM16A is the pore-forming α-subunit and KCNE1 the β-subunit. Therefore, TMEM16A-KCNE1 association is not only found upon recombinant overexpression, but can also be observed in native cells, notably in renal PCT cells, in which the complex responds to the renin-angiotensin system involved in physiological blood pressure regulation.
Our detailed study of the signaling pathway, linking the renin-angiotensin system activation to the Cl − TMEM16A-KCNE1 current, demonstrates that it is the phosphorylation of the KCNE1 β-subunit that confers the ability to TMEM16A α-subunit to be stimulated by AngII. In fact, phosphorylation of KCNE1-S102 is responsible for the totality of the effect observed upon AngII binding on AT1R. Therefore, KCNE1 mediates a dynamic channel regulation by involving intracellular PKC-dependent pathways. Interestingly, the PKC-targeted S102 residue was shown to lead to a reduced I Ks current, carried by KCNQ1-KCNE1 complex, when phosphorylated ( Kanda et al., 2011 24. Kanda, V.A. ∙ Purtell, K. ∙ Abbott, G.W. Protein kinase C downregulates I(Ks) by stimulating KCNQ1-KCNE1 potassium channel endocytosis Heart Rhythm. 2011; 8 :1641-1647 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ; Xu et al., 2009 55. Xu, X. ∙ Kanda, V.A. ∙ Choi, E. ... MinK-dependent internalization of the IKs potassium channel Cardiovasc. Res. 2009; 82 :430-438 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Our electrophysiological assays, using truncated forms of KCNE1 and synthetic peptides based on the β-subunit, allowed us to determine the crucial role of the N terminus of KCNE1 in TMEM16A regulation. More specifically, we have observed that the segment closer to the transmembrane domain of KCNE1 is necessary and sufficient to recapitulate the action of the entire KCNE1 on the TMEM16A current. The synthetic peptide generated on the basis of this segment’s sequence is the first designed TMEM16A agonist and may be useful for clinical applications. Notably, activation of an apical chloride channel such as TMEM16A triggers the secretion of water, which makes TMEM16A-targeted activators potential drug candidates for treatment of cystic fibrosis or dry eye syndromes.
The KCNE1 N-terminal 13-amino acid segment bears at least two residues that are subject topolymorphisms (R32H and S38G) related with cardiac arrhythmias ( Crump and Abbott, 2014 13. Crump, S.M. ∙ Abbott, G.W. Arrhythmogenic KCNE gene variants: current knowledge and future challenges Front. Genet. 2014; 5 :3 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ). Whereas several clinically relevant KCNE1 variants were found to modify its ability to regulate KCNQ1, providing a link between these mutations and polymorphisms with cardiac arrhythmias, the KCNE1 S38G poorly impairs KCNQ1 regulation by KCNE1 ( Yao et al., 2018 57. Yao, H. ∙ Ji, C.C. ∙ Cheng, Y.J. ... Mutation in KCNE1 associated to early repolarization syndrome by modulation of slowly activating delayed rectifier K + current Exp. Cell Res. 2018; 363 :315-320 Crossref Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that the KCNE1 S38G as well as the R32H mutants lost their ability to regulate TMEM16A, suggesting a potential role of this chloride current in cardiac arrhythmias. Along this line, a recent study performed in canine heart suggests a protective role for TMEM16A against risk of arrhythmias by reducing spatial and temporal heterogeneity of cardiac repolarization and early after-depolarization ( Hegyi et al., 2017 22. Hegyi, B. ∙ Horváth, B. ∙ Váczi, K. ... Ca 2+ -activated Cl - current is antiarrhythmic by reducing both spatial and temporal heterogeneity of cardiac repolarization J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2017; 109 :27-37 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To sum up, we have found that KCNE1, a well-known auxiliary subunit of voltage-dependent K + channels, fulfills the four needed conditions to be considered as an auxiliary subunit of the anoctamin anion channel superfamily ( Adelman, 1995 1. Adelman, J.P. Proteins that interact with the pore-forming subunits of voltage-gated ion channels Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1995; 5 :286-295 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ; Arikkath and Campbell, 2003 3. Arikkath, J. ∙ Campbell, K.P. Auxiliary subunits: essential components of the voltage-gated calcium channel complex Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2003; 13 :298-307 Crossref Scopus (437) PubMed Google Scholar ; Cannon, 2007 8. Cannon, S.C. Physiologic principles underlying ion channelopathies Neurotherapeutics. 2007; 4 :174-183 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ; Gurnett and Campbell, 1996 19. Gurnett, C.A. ∙ Campbell, K.P. Transmembrane auxiliary subunits of voltage-dependent ion channels J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271 :27975-27978 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ; Trimmer, 1998 46. Trimmer, J.S. Regulation of ion channel expression by cytoplasmic subunits Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8 :370-374 Crossref Scopus (96) PubMed Google Scholar ): first, KCNE1 does not show any ion channel activity by itself, second, KCNE1 and TMEM16A interact directly and stably with a fixed stoichiometry (2α:2β), third, KCNE1 modifies drastically the TMEM16A function enabling the channel to work in the absence of elevated cytosolic calcium, and fourth, KCNE1 regulates TMEM16A in native tissue. Therefore, KCNE1 is a bona fide auxiliary subunit of two distinct classes of ion channel superfamilies which are not phylogenetically related: the voltage-gated cation channel and the anoctamin superfamily. Finally, the TMEM16A-KCNE1 association should be considered when analyzing outcomes of clinically relevant KCNE1 mutations, as emphasized by the finding that two known cardiac arrhythmia-related KCNE1 variants, including S38G, lost their ability to regulate TMEM16A.

HEK293T (ATCC, #CRL11268) cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS in 35 mm dishes. At 70%–80% confluency they were transiently co-transfected using lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) or the calcium phosphate method with a total amount of 1 and 3.5 μg of DNA, respectively, and seeded on 18 mm diameter poly-L-lysine-coated glass coverslips in 12 well plates. Cells were recorded or used for SiMPull experiments 24 h – 48 h after their transfection.
Proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) cells originating from either wild-type or kcne1 −/− mice (inbred 129Sv) ( Vetter et al., 1996 50. Vetter, D.E. ∙ Mann, J.R. ∙ Wangemann, P. ... Inner ear defects induced by null mutation of the isk gene Neuron. 1996; 17 :1251-1264 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (337) PubMed Google Scholar ) were prepared as described previously ( Barrière et al., 2003 6. Barrière, H. ∙ Rubera, I. ∙ Belfodil, R. ... Swelling-activated chloride and potassium conductance in primary cultures of mouse proximal tubules. Implication of KCNE1 protein J. Membr. Biol. 2003; 193 :153-170 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ). Culture were maintained in DMEM/F12 (Sigma) supplemented with 1% FBS (Dutscher), 5 mg/l insulin, 5 mg/l transferrin, 30 nM sodium selenite (ITS, Sigma), 2 mM glutamine, 10 nM triiodothyronine (T3, Sigma), 20 mM HEPES (GIBCO), 50 nM dexamethasone (Sigma) and 10μg/l EGF (Sigma). At 70%–80% confluency they were transiently transfected using the calcium phosphate method with a total amount of 3.5 μg of DNA and seeded on collagen-coated glass coverslips.
mTMEM16A splice variant “a” (kindly provided by Dr Lily Yeh Jan, RefSeq: NM_001242349.1), mTMEM16A 444 EEEE/AAAA 447 (kindly provided by Dr Criss Hartzell) and hKCNE1 cDNA (RefSeq: NM_000219.5) were subcloned in pIRES2eGFP, pcDNA3.1, pCDNA3.1-GFP-X and pCMV-HA vectors. Truncations and mutations were generated by PCR. For SiMPull experiments, HA-tags were fused to the N terminus of sequences, whereas GFP-tags were fused to the C-terminal part.
HEK293T and PCT cell electrophysiology was performed 24 – 48 h after transfection. For whole-cell patch-clamp experiments, cells were recorded in a bath solution containing (in mM) 150 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 CaCl 2 and 10 HEPES, pH 7.4. The glass pipettes (2-5 MΩ of resistance) were filled with (in mM) 5 NaCl, 135 CsCl, 2 MgCl 2 , 5 EGTA, 10 HEPES, pH 7.3. Concentrations of AngII, PMA, CPT-cAMP and of the different inhibitors used are indicated in the respective figure legends with incubation times ranging from 20 to 40 min. For siRNA experiments cells were transfected overnight with 50 pmol siRNA using lipofectamine 2000 and recorded the next day. Total calcium concentration was calculated with Maxchelator ( https://somapp.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/pharmacology/bers/maxchelator/ ) for a temperature of 20°C. HEK293T and PCT cells were recorded at room temperature in voltage-clamp mode using an Axopatch 200B (Molecular Devices) amplifier. Signals were filtered at 10 kHz and digitalized at 20 kHz. Whole-cell currents were elicited by voltage-ramps (from −100 to +100 mV, 1 s) and I-V stimulation pulses (from −100 to +100 mV in 20 mV increments, 1 s each pulse), holding the cells at −80 mV. Current densities were measured at +100 mV.
For inside-out recordings, the extracellular (pipette) solution contained (in mM) 140 NaCl, 10 HEPES and 0.1 EGTA. The intracellular (bath) solution had the same composition as the pipette solutions for recordings in absence of Ca 2+ . A saturating Ca 2+ solution (∼20 μM Ca 2+ ) was prepared by adding 0.12 mM of CaCl 2 to the bath solution. Non-saturating solutions included (in mM) 1 EGTA and 0.59, 0.79, 0.89, 0.94 of CaCl 2 to obtain 0.1 μM, 0.25 μM, 0.5 μM and 1 μM free-Ca 2+ solutions, respectively. The pH of inside-out solutions was adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH. Cell recordings, data acquisition and analysis of electrophysiology were performed using pClamp software (Molecular Devices).
For anion permeability experiments, cells were recorded using a pipette filled with CsCl 140 mM. The permeability ratio P X /P Cl was calculated from the reversal potential shift (ΔE r ) given by the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation ( Equation 1 ), when replacing extracellular Cl - with ion X - , Δ ⁢ 𝑬 𝒓 = 𝑬 𝒓 𝑿 − 𝑬 𝒓 𝑪 𝒍 = 𝑹 𝑻 𝒛 𝑭 ⁢ 𝒍 𝒏 ⁡ 𝑷 ⁢ 𝑿 − ⁢ [ 𝑿 − ] 𝒐 𝑷 𝑪 ⁢ 𝒍 − ⁢ [ 𝑪 ⁢ 𝒍 − ] 𝒐 Equation 1 in which, E rX and E rCl represent the reversal potentials of ions X - and Cl - , and [X - ] o and [Cl - ] o represent concentrations of ions X - and Cl - in the bath solution, respectively.
For SiMPull assays, we followed the protocol previously described by Jain et al. (2011) 23. Jain, A. ∙ Liu, R. ∙ Ramani, B. ... Probing cellular protein complexes using single-molecule pull-down Nature. 2011; 473 :484-488 Crossref Scopus (337) PubMed Google Scholar . Briefly, HEK293T cells co-transfected with an HA-tagged bait protein and a GFP-fused prey protein (applying the widely used eGFP A206K mutant which greatly reduces homodimerization events) ( Zacharias et al., 2002 58. Zacharias, D.A. ∙ Violin, J.D. ∙ Newton, A.C. ... Partitioning of lipid-modified monomeric GFPs into membrane microdomains of live cells Science. 2002; 296 :913-916 Crossref Scopus (1860) PubMed Google Scholar ) were lysed in a buffer containing (in mM): 150 NaCl, 10 Tris pH 7.5, 1 EDTA, protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche-Diagnostics) and 1.5% IGEPAL (Sigma). Lysates were collected and pulled-down on coverslips passivated with PEG (99%) and biotin-PEG (1%) and treated with neutravidin (1.4 mg/mL, ThermoFisher) and biotinylated anti-HA antibody (15 nM, BioLegend). Several washes with T50 buffer (in mM: 50 NaCl, 10 Tris, 20 EDTA; 0.1 mg/mL BSA, pH 7.5) were performed to avoid unspecific protein binding. Finally, single molecule complexes were imaged using a 488 nm Argon laser in total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy with a 100x objective (Nikon). 13 × 13 μm 2 movies of 250 frames were acquired at frame rates of 10–30 Hz and analyzed using Fiji software (NIH). Multiple independent experiments were performed for each condition and only the spots which were fully bleached at the end of the illumination were considered. Representative datasets are presented to quantitatively compare the different conditions.
Analysis of obtained currents in whole-cell and inside-out recordings was performed using ClampFit. For analysis of ramp traces and I-V traces cursors were set at 100 mV, where we extracted the average current. Signals were filtered at 10 kHz and digitalized at 20 kHz. Statistical details can be found in the figure legends and in the main text. Reported n values can be found in the figure legends. For SiMPull experiments a minimum of 15 movies per condition was acquired in at least two independent experiments. Per movie, at least 50 bleaching traces were analyzed. Statistical analysis was performed in SigmaPlot and Excel.
