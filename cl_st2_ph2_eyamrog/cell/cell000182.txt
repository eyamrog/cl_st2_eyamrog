Title: The In Situ Structure of Parkinson’s Disease-Linked LRRK2


Abstract: Summary

Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are the most frequent cause of familial Parkinson’s disease. LRRK2 is a multi-domain protein containing a kinase and GTPase. Using correlative light and electron microscopy, in situ cryo-electron tomography, and subtomogram analysis, we reveal a 14-Å structure of LRRK2 bearing a pathogenic mutation that oligomerizes as a right-handed double helix around microtubules, which are left-handed. Using integrative modeling, we determine the architecture of LRRK2, showing that the GTPase and kinase are in close proximity, with the GTPase closer to the microtubule surface, whereas the kinase is exposed to the cytoplasm. We identify two oligomerization interfaces mediated by non-catalytic domains. Mutation of one of these abolishes LRRK2 microtubule-association. Our work demonstrates the power of cryo-electron tomography to generate models of previously unsolved structures in their cellular environment.

Section: Introduction

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. About 10% of patients show a clear family history, and mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are the most frequent cause of familial PD ( Roosen and Cookson, 2016 62. Roosen, D.A. ∙ Cookson, M.R. LRRK2 at the interface of autophagosomes, endosomes and lysosomes Mol. Neurodegener. 2016; 11 :73 Crossref Scopus (127) PubMed Google Scholar ; Thomas and Beal, 2007 77. Thomas, B. ∙ Beal, M.F. Parkinson’s disease Hum Mol Genet. 2007; 16 :R183-R194 Crossref Scopus (700) PubMed Google Scholar ). LRRK2 is a 286 kDa protein with an N-terminal half containing repeating motifs and a C-terminal half composed of kinase and GTPase domains surrounded by protein-protein interaction domains ( Kalia and Lang, 2015 44. Kalia, L.V. ∙ Lang, A.E. Parkinson’s disease Lancet. 2015; 386 :896-912 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (3871) PubMed Google Scholar ). Most of the pathogenic mutations are found in the two catalytic domains, but all result in hyperactivation of the kinase in cells ( Steger et al., 2016 73. Steger, M. ∙ Tonelli, F. ∙ Ito, G. ... Phosphoproteomics reveals that Parkinson’s disease kinase LRRK2 regulates a subset of Rab GTPases eLife. 2016; 5 :e12813 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Hyperactivation of LRRK2’s kinase is also reported in non-familial PD cases ( Di Maio et al., 2018 21. Di Maio, R. ∙ Hoffman, E.K. ∙ Rocha, E.M. ... LRRK2 activation in idiopathic Parkinson’s disease Sci. Transl. Med. 2018; 10 :eaar5429 Crossref Scopus (314) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting that suppression of kinase activity might be beneficial for a wide range of PD patients. However, how LRRK2 kinase activity is regulated on a molecular and cellular level and how abnormal LRRK2 kinase activity leads to PD remains unclear. LRRK2 is involved in several cellular processes, including neurite outgrowth and synaptic morphogenesis, membrane trafficking, autophagy, and protein synthesis ( Kalia and Lang, 2015 44. Kalia, L.V. ∙ Lang, A.E. Parkinson’s disease Lancet. 2015; 386 :896-912 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (3871) PubMed Google Scholar ), and it has been shown to phosphorylate a subgroup of Rab GTPases, modulating their membrane localization and function ( Steger et al., 2016 73. Steger, M. ∙ Tonelli, F. ∙ Ito, G. ... Phosphoproteomics reveals that Parkinson’s disease kinase LRRK2 regulates a subset of Rab GTPases eLife. 2016; 5 :e12813 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ).
In cells, wild-type LRRK2, as observed by immunofluorescence microscopy, is predominantly cytosolic ( Eguchi et al., 2018 22. Eguchi, T. ∙ Kuwahara, T. ∙ Sakurai, M. ... LRRK2 and its substrate Rab GTPases are sequentially targeted onto stressed lysosomes and maintain their homeostasis Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115 :E9115-E9124 Crossref Scopus (163) PubMed Google Scholar ). Exogenously expressed wild-type LRRK2, visualized via epitope or fluorescent protein tags, is also mostly cytosolic while some of the common PD mutations can also be seen forming filamentous structures surrounding microtubules. Filament formation is enhanced in N1437H, R1441G/C, Y1699C, and I2020T LRRK2 mutants and has been observed in multiple cell types ( Blanca Ramírez et al., 2017 9.

USA. 2019; 116 :14979-14988 Crossref Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ). While it remains to be determined how enhanced microtubule association by the LRRK2 mutants may contribute to their pathogenicity, pharmacological inhibition of LRRK2’s kinase causes rapid and reversible recruitment of both wild-type and mutant LRRK2 proteins to microtubules ( Blanca Ramírez et al., 2017 9.

USA. 2019; 116 :14979-14988 Crossref Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ).
A major barrier to understanding the mechanism of LRRK2 is the lack of structural information on the protein, which to date only includes structures of domains, either single or in tandem. Many of these are from a distantly related bacterial homolog ( Deyaert et al., 2019 20. Deyaert, E. ∙ Leemans, M. ∙ Singh, R.K. ...

Given the paucity of structural information about LRRK2 and its importance as a target for PD treatment, we set out to determine the structure of human LRRK2 using in situ cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET). Achieving high-resolution in situ using cryo-ET is greatly helped by helical structures because they combine symmetry with all of the views required to generate a fully sampled structure. Given the helical nature of microtubules, we reasoned that microtubule-associated LRRK2 would be an ideal sample. Here, we report a 14 Å structure of human LRRK2(I2020T) bound to microtubules as ordered filaments, determining the overall domain structure of LRRK2 in cells and the architecture of the microtubule-associated filaments.

Section: Results and Discussion

To determine the structure of microtubule-associated LRRK2, we used cryo-correlative light and electron microscopy (cryo-CLEM) to image LRRK2 filaments in situ ( Figure 1 ). To increase the population of LRRK2-decorated microtubules we could image, we used several approaches. First, we chose to express LRRK2 bearing the pathogenic I2020T mutation because it has previously been shown to spontaneously undergo filament formation and decorate cellular microtubules by immuno-electron microscopy ( Kett et al., 2012 45. Kett, L.R. ∙ Boassa, D. ∙ Ho, C.C. ... LRRK2 Parkinson disease mutations enhance its microtubule association Hum. Mol. Genet. 2012; 21 :890-899 Crossref Scopus (154) PubMed Google Scholar ). Second, we stabilized microtubules with Taxol, which was previously shown to increase the percentage of cells showing LRRK2 filamentous structures but was not necessary for their formation ( Kett et al., 2012 45. Kett, L.R. ∙ Boassa, D. ∙ Ho, C.C. ... LRRK2 Parkinson disease mutations enhance its microtubule association Hum. Mol. Genet. 2012; 21 :890-899 Crossref Scopus (154) PubMed Google Scholar ). We began by growing human HEK293T cells expressing amino-terminally yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-tagged LRRK2 with the I2020T mutation, hereafter LRRK2(I2020T), on EM grids. After vitrification, cells containing filamentous LRRK2(I2020T) were identified by cryo-fluorescence microscopy. Cryo-focused ion beam (cryo-FIB) milling of these cells was then used to prepare lamellae for cryo-ET ( Figures 1 A–1C). The LRRK2(I2020T)-decorated microtubules were identified by CLEM as regions where microtubule bundles in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images overlapped with the YFP signal of LRRK2(I2020T) in the fluorescence images ( Figures 1 D–1F). Subsequently, cryo-ET was performed in these regions ( Figures 1 G and 1H).
We first characterized the microtubules in our tomograms. Microtubules are formed from heterodimers of alpha- and beta-tubulin and polymerize into polar left-handed helical arrays, which, in human cells, typically consist of 13 protofilaments ( Chaaban and Brouhard, 2017 14. Chaaban, S. ∙ Brouhard, G.J. A microtubule bestiary: structural diversity in tubulin polymers Mol. Biol. Cell. 2017; 28 :2924-2931 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). We annotated each microtubule individually by computationally determining its coordinates ( Figure S1 A). Within bundles, most of the decorated microtubules were aligned parallel to each other ( Figures 2 B–2E), with a center-to-center distance of 70 ± 18 nm ( Figure 2 E). This regular distribution of angles and distances suggests that pathogenic LRRK2 mediates microtubule bundling. Most microtubules were either undecorated or fully decorated, and these two populations coexisted within the same cellular regions ( Figure 2 A). Protofilament number and polarity of each microtubule was determined by subtomogram analysis ( Figure S1 B). Microtubules within a given bundle largely had the same polarity ( Figures 2 B and 2C). Unexpectedly, we observed populations of non-conventional 11- and 12-protofilament microtubules (5% and 56%, respectively), in addition to the 13-protofilament microtubules (39%) that are typically found in human cells ( Chaaban and Brouhard, 2017 14. Chaaban, S. ∙ Brouhard, G.J. A microtubule bestiary: structural diversity in tubulin polymers Mol. Biol. Cell. 2017; 28 :2924-2931 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 2 D). To determine if bundling and microtubule protofilament number was specific to LRRK2(I2020T) expression, we examined microtubule populations in cells treated with Taxol but without LRRK2(I2020T) expression. Under these conditions, we did not observe any decorated microtubules or bundles and found that microtubules consisted primarily of 13-protofilament (92%) microtubules ( Figures 2 F–2I).
After classification of microtubules according to protofilament numbers, we used subtomogram analysis to resolve the helical arrangement of LRRK2(I2020T) bound to microtubules ( Figure 3 A; Figures S1 C and S1D). We found that LRRK2(I2020T) forms a right-handed double helix around 11-, 12-, and 13-protofilament microtubules ( Figure 3 A). Thus, there is a symmetry mismatch between the right-handed LRRK2(I2020T) and the left-handed microtubule helices ( Figures 3 A and 3B; helical parameters in Table S1 ). Along the LRRK2(I2020T) helix, we identified repeating units (protomers) with a C2 symmetry axis perpendicular to the filament axis. The number of LRRK2(I2020T) protomers per turn matched the microtubule protofilament number, with 11, 12, and 13 LRRK2(I2020T) protomers per turn around 11-, 12-, and 13-protofilament microtubules, respectively ( Figure 3 A). LRRK2(I2020T) showed a clear preference for 11- and 12-protofilament microtubules ( Figure 2 D). The interaction between LRRK2 bound to 11-protofilament microtubules also appeared better resolved than LRRK2 bound to 12- and 13-protofilament microtubules, despite its smaller dataset ( Figure 3 A). The physiological significance of the preferential LRRK2 decoration and possible stabilization of microtubules with non-conventional protofilament numbers remains to be determined.
To determine the three-dimensional architecture of LRRK2 in microtubule-associated filaments, we performed further subtomogram analysis by extracting individual protomer subtomograms from 12-protofilament microtubule-bound LRRK2 because this was the most abundant species in our dataset ( Figure 3 A; Figures S1 F–S1N). We obtained a map at a resolution of 14 Å ( Figure 3 C; Figures S1 K and S1L), with higher local resolution in parts of the LRRK2 protomer ( Figure 3 D). To date, the only eukaryotic in situ structures of comparable resolution are of ribosomes ( Delarue et al., 2018 17. Delarue, M. ∙ Brittingham, G.P. ∙ Pfeffer, S. ... mTORC1 Controls Phase Separation and the Biophysical Properties of the Cytoplasm by Tuning Crowding Cell. 2018; 174 :338-349.e20 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (244) PubMed Google Scholar ; Schaffer et al., 2019 66.

Methods. 2019; 16 :757-762 Crossref Scopus (135) PubMed Google Scholar ) and proteasomes ( Guo et al., 2018a 36. Guo, Q. ∙ Lehmer, C. ∙ Martínez-Sánchez, A. ... In situ structure of neuronal C9orf72 poly-GA aggregates reveals proteasome recruitment Cell. 2018; 172 :696-705.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (264) PubMed Google Scholar ), whose structures had previously been determined by other methods.
A salient feature in our map was adjacent donut-shaped densities ( Figures 3 C and 3F). We could unambiguously assign the identity of these densities as the LRRK2 WD40 domains by docking their recently reported X-ray structure, which was solved as a dimer ( Zhang et al., 2019 87. Zhang, P. ∙ Fan, Y. ∙ Ru, H. ... Crystal structure of the WD40 domain dimer of LRRK2 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2019; 116 :1579-1584 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures 3 E and 3F). The LRRK2 filament density shows two 2-fold axes of symmetry perpendicular to the microtubule axis, suggesting two sites of homotypic interaction ( Figures 3 G and 3H), one of which forms a Z-shaped protomer dimerizing through the WD40:WD40 interface ( Figure 3 G). The second homotypic interaction results in a S-shaped dimer and most likely involves a C-terminal of ROC (COR):COR interface ( Figure 3 H; see below). Thus, the repeating unit of the LRRK2 helix is a protomer representing a LRRK2 dimer, which can be defined by either a WD40:WD40 or a COR:COR interface ( Figures 3 G and 3H). We did not observe the characteristic extended arch-shaped densities for the N-terminal Armadillo (ARM) and Ankyrin (ANK) or Leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains in the best resolved area of the protomer close to the microtubule. This is consistent with the previous observation that the four C-terminal domains, Ras of complex (ROC), COR, kinase, and WD40 domains ( Figure 4 A), are sufficient for microtubule association in cells ( Kett et al., 2012 45. Kett, L.R. ∙ Boassa, D. ∙ Ho, C.C. ... LRRK2 Parkinson disease mutations enhance its microtubule association Hum. Mol. Genet. 2012; 21 :890-899 Crossref Scopus (154) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Next, we used an integrative modeling approach ( Lasker et al., 2009 51. Lasker, K. ∙ Topf, M. ∙ Sali, A. ... Inferential optimization for simultaneous fitting of multiple components into a CryoEM map of their assembly J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 388 :180-194 Crossref Scopus (100) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S2 ) to build a model of LRRK2 into the S-shaped protomer map ( Figure 4 ). We combined available crystallographic and homology models of the ROC, COR (split into COR N and COR C ), kinase, and WD40 domains, using the WD40 domain as an anchor point.

Blanca Ramírez, M. ∙ Lara Ordóñez, A.J. ∙ Fdez, E. ... GTP binding regulates cellular localization of Parkinson’s disease-associated LRRK2 Hum. Mol. Genet. 2017; 26 :2747-2767 Crossref Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kett et al., 2012 45. Kett, L.R. ∙ Boassa, D. ∙ Ho, C.C. ...

Phosphoproteomics reveals that Parkinson’s disease kinase LRRK2 regulates a subset of Rab GTPases eLife. 2016; 5 :e12813 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), our structure most likely represents an active-like kinase conformation. Thus, we used a humanized kinase-active model derived from an amoeba Roco4 protein (PDB: 4F0F ) ( Gilsbach et al., 2012 30. Gilsbach, B.K. ∙ Ho, F.Y. ∙ Vetter, I.R. ... Roco kinase structures give insights into the mechanism of Parkinson disease-related leucine-rich-repeat kinase 2 mutations Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109 :10322-10327 Crossref Scopus (85) PubMed Google Scholar ) for our integrative modeling. Systematic sampling of combinations of domain placements within the cryo-EM density map, subject to polypeptide connectivity and steric-clash restraints, yielded a single possible architecture of LRRK2(I2020T) in terms of the relative spatial arrangement of its domains, represented by 1,167 models that were further categorized into 53 clusters with slight variations in the centroid and orientation of each domain ( Figures S2 and S6 ). One of these models of human LRRK2(I2020T), displayed inside the subtomogram average of the protomer, is shown in Figures 4 C–4E.
Our LRRK2 model recapitulates the monomeric ROC-COR configuration observed in the X-ray structure of the homologous bacterial protein (PDB: 6HLU ) ( Deyaert et al., 2019 20. Deyaert, E. ∙ Leemans, M. ∙ Singh, R.K. ... Structure and nucleotide-induced conformational dynamics of the Chlorobium tepidum Roco protein Biochem. J. 2019; 476 :51-66 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ), even though the ROC and COR domains were modeled as separate units during integrative modeling ( Figure S3 B versus Figure S3 C). Comparing the architecture of the monomeric bacterial ROC-COR (PDB: 6HLU ) and our LRRK2 monomer models indicated that among the 53 clusters, one cluster particularly resembles the bacterial ROC-COR conformation with an average backbone RMSD of ∼10 Å, reflecting slight changes in orientation ( Figures S3 F and S3G). However, the dimerization interfaces of LRRK2 differ significantly from the interfaces seen in two crystal structures of the bacterial LRRK2 homologs ( Deyaert et al., 2019 20. Deyaert, E. ∙ Leemans, M. ∙ Singh, R.K. ... Structure and nucleotide-induced conformational dynamics of the Chlorobium tepidum Roco protein Biochem.

Structure of the Roc-COR domain tandem of C. tepidum, a prokaryotic homologue of the human LRRK2 Parkinson kinase EMBO J. 2008; 27 :2239-2249 Crossref Scopus (107) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S3 D versus Figure S3 E) and from those in an integrative model of LRRK2 in solution based on an EM map using negative stain ( Guaitoli et al., 2016 34. Guaitoli, G. ∙ Raimondi, F. ∙ Gilsbach, B.K. ... Structural model of the dimeric Parkinson’s protein LRRK2 reveals a compact architecture involving distant interdomain contacts Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113 :E4357-E4366 Crossref Scopus (110) PubMed Google Scholar ).
In our structure, the ROC (GTPase) domain is closest to the microtubule surface ( Figures 4 C–4E), consistent with observations that the ROC domain of LRRK2 is sufficient for interaction with tubulin heterodimers ( Gandhi et al., 2008 29. Gandhi, P.N. ∙ Wang, X. ∙ Zhu, X. ... The Roc domain of leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 is sufficient for interaction with microtubules J. Neurosci. Res. 2008; 86 :1711-1720 Crossref Scopus (145) PubMed Google Scholar ). GTP binding and hydrolysis by the ROC domain have been proposed to be involved in dimerization ( Deyaert et al., 2019 20. Deyaert, E. ∙ Leemans, M. ∙ Singh, R.K. ... Structure and nucleotide-induced conformational dynamics of the Chlorobium tepidum Roco protein Biochem. J. 2019; 476 :51-66 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ), filament formation around microtubules ( Blanca Ramírez et al., 2017 9. Blanca Ramírez, M. ∙ Lara Ordóñez, A.J. ∙ Fdez, E. ... GTP binding regulates cellular localization of Parkinson’s disease-associated LRRK2 Hum. Mol. Genet. 2017; 26 :2747-2767 Crossref Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ), and regulation of kinase activity ( Biosa et al., 2013 8. Biosa, A. ∙ Trancikova, A. ∙ Civiero, L. ... GTPase activity regulates kinase activity and cellular phenotypes of Parkinson’s disease-associated LRRK2 Hum. Mol. Genet. 2013; 22 :1140-1156 Crossref Scopus (105) PubMed Google Scholar ). In our model, the ROC and kinase domains are in close spatial proximity ( cf. sequence proximity), hinting at direct crosstalk between the catalytic (GTPase and kinase) domains of LRRK2 ( Figure 4 D). However, higher resolution structures are needed to pinpoint these contacts and map the pathogenic mutations.
Our model shows the kinase domain distal to the microtubule and exposed to the cytosol ( Figure 4 C). Although we expected that the microtubule-bound form of LRRK2 would contain the kinase in its active-like conformation, and thus used that state in our integrative modeling, we wanted to evaluate whether the conformation of the kinase could influence the arrangements of the other domains. To test this, we replaced the kinase-active domain with a humanized version of the kinase-inactive conformation of the same protein (PDB: 4F0G ) ( Gilsbach et al., 2012 30. Gilsbach, B.K. ∙ Ho, F.Y. ∙ Vetter, I.R. ... Roco kinase structures give insights into the mechanism of Parkinson disease-related leucine-rich-repeat kinase 2 mutations Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109 :10322-10327 Crossref Scopus (85) PubMed Google Scholar ) and found that significantly less models satisfied all restraints at every step of integrative modeling. In order to directly compare both conformations of the kinase domain, we selected models present in the final ensemble for both conformations and evaluated the percentage of steric backbone clashes. We measured an average of 17% more clashes in the kinase-inactive domain across all models, suggesting that our structure reflects an active-like kinase conformation.
Outside the filament that we modeled, our data contained densities connecting the two strands of the LRRK2 helices that decorate microtubules, suggesting inter-helix contacts ( Figure 4 F). We generated an 18 Å resolution map encompassing a larger volume around the protomer that revealed two hook-like structures stemming from the protomer ( Figure 4 G; Figures S1 J, S1M, S1N, and S1P). Given their shape and adjacency to the ROC domain, these densities likely represent the LRR domains ( Figure 4 H). Thus, it is likely there is a third homotypic interaction, mediated by the LRR domains, that connects the two strands of the double helix, contributing to its regular spacing along the microtubule ( Figure 4 F). In our density maps, the N-terminal ARM and ANK domains were not resolved, presumably because of flexibility. However, we observed additional density in the periphery of the LRRK2-decorated microtubules that is absent from undecorated microtubules ( Figure S1 E). The density approximately spans the distance between decorated microtubules within a bundle, suggesting that the ARM and ANK domains form connections between adjacent microtubules.
Lastly, to test our model, we set out to determine if disrupting one of the two dimer interfaces we observed affected the formation of microtubule-associated LRRK2 filaments in cells. Because the precise COR:COR interface could not be determined because of the limited resolution of the EM density, we focused on the LRRK2 WD40:WD40 interface. The G2385R mutation located in the WD40 domain is a risk factor for PD ( Fung et al., 2006 28. Fung, H.C. ∙ Chen, C.M. ∙ Hardy, J. ... A common genetic factor for Parkinson disease in ethnic Chinese population in Taiwan BMC Neurol. 2006; 6 :47 Crossref Scopus (81) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tan, 2006 74. Tan, E.K. Identification of a common genetic risk variant (LRRK2 Gly2385Arg) in Parkinson’s disease Ann. Acad. Med. Singapore. 2006; 35 :840-842 PubMed Google Scholar ) and has been shown to disrupt dimerization of isolated WD40 domains in vitro ( Zhang et al., 2019 87. Zhang, P. ∙ Fan, Y. ∙ Ru, H. ... Crystal structure of the WD40 domain dimer of LRRK2 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2019; 116 :1579-1584 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ). G2385 is located near the WD40:WD40 interface ( Figures 5 A and 5B). We hypothesized that the G2385R mutation might impair filament formation in cells. To test this, we expressed Halo-tagged wild-type or G2385R LRRK2 in human HEK293T cells in the presence or absence of the LRRK2-specific kinase inhibitor MLi-2 ( Fell et al., 2015 25.

USA. 2019; 116 :14979-14988 Crossref Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that MLi-2 induced filament formation in cells expressing wild-type LRRK2 but not in cells expressing G2385R LRRK2 ( Figures 5 C and 5D) in agreement with previous studies using another LRRK2 kinase inhibitor, LRRK2-IN-1 ( Rudenko et al., 2012 63.

J. 2012; 446 :99-111 Crossref Scopus (94) PubMed Google Scholar ). These data support our model that the WD40:WD40 protomer interface is necessary for the formation of LRRK2 filaments.
We have shown that recent advances in cryo-ET and subtomogram analysis can be used to generate models of proteins in situ through an integrative modeling approach, making it possible to generate structural hypotheses in a cellular context. In order to achieve this, there must be orthogonal means to ensure that the structures being analyzed correspond to the right targets. In few selected cases, e.g., ribosomes and associated proteins, the molecular complexes can be directly recognized by comparing them to known structures ( Albert et al., 2020 1.

However, in most cases, proteins cannot yet be unequivocally identified directly from cryo-ET alone. For those cases, cryo-CLEM is key to identifying the location of the molecules under study ( Bharat and Kukulski, 2019 4. Bharat, T.A. ∙ Kukulski, W.

In this work, we determined the structure of a large portion of the full-length human LRRK2 bound to microtubules. The structure includes its catalytic kinase and GTPase domains and all regions of LRRK2 where PD mutations are found. Because all filament-forming LRRK2 mutants show increased kinase activity in cells ( Blanca Ramírez et al., 2017 9. Blanca Ramírez, M. ∙ Lara Ordóñez, A.J. ∙ Fdez, E. ...

Phosphoproteomics reveals that Parkinson’s disease kinase LRRK2 regulates a subset of Rab GTPases eLife. 2016; 5 :e12813 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), and because kinase inhibitors that stabilize an active-like conformation induce LRRK2 filament formation ( Blanca Ramírez et al., 2017 9. Blanca Ramírez, M. ∙ Lara Ordóñez, A.J. ∙ Fdez, E. ... GTP binding regulates cellular localization of Parkinson’s disease-associated LRRK2 Hum. Mol.

USA. 2019; 116 :14979-14988 Crossref Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ), we present a model of a human kinase-active LRRK2 structure found in cells. Our structure revealed the domain organization of LRRK2 and showed that the two non-catalytic domains in its C-terminal half (COR and WD40) are involved in the formation of microtubule-associated filaments. The structure showed that LRRK2’s kinase and GTPase are in close spatial proximity, providing a structural explanation for the reported functional crosstalk between these domains ( Ito et al., 2007 42. Ito, G. ∙ Okai, T. ∙ Fujino, G. ...

Parkinson’s disease-associated mutations in LRRK2 link enhanced GTP-binding and kinase activities to neuronal toxicity Hum. Mol.

The unconventional G-protein cycle of LRRK2 and Roco proteins Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2016; 44 :1611-1616 Crossref Scopus (10) PubMed Google Scholar ). The structure also showed that LRRK2’s kinase faces the cytosol and is thus capable of interacting with potential substrates. Some of the major challenges that will be addressed in future work include imaging endogenously expressed LRRK2, directly visualizing it while it interacts with microtubules and their associated proteins, as well as with other LRRK2 partners, in situ . Our work has highlighted how recent advances in cryo-CLEM, cryo-ET, and integrative modeling make it possible to tackle these major cell biological questions.

The N-terminal Halo-tag was cloned by using the primer sets: 5′-GAGTAACTAGCATAACCCCTTGGC-3′ and 5′-CACTAGCCATGTTATCGCTCTGAAAGTACAGATC-3′ with the pHTN HaloTag® CMV-neo Vector (Promega) as a template. The two segments were assembled using the NEBuilder® HiFi DNA Assembly Kit following their suggested protocol. The G2358R mutation was made by using the NEB Q5-site directed mutagenesis kit, and the primers were designed based on the online tool NEBBaseChanger. The constructs were sequenced and expressed in HEK293T cells to confirm the expression of full-length LRRK2(I2020T).
For expression of LRRK2(I2020T), the HEK293T cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding full-length LRRK2(I2020T) fused with YFP at the N terminus using a Lipofectamine 3000 transfection kit (TFS) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. After 2 days, 5 μM paclitaxel ( aka Taxol, from Cell Signaling technology) was added. After 16 to 24 h of Taxol treatment, the cells were detached, and counted with a hemocytometer. Quantifoil 200 mesh holey carbon R4/1 or R2/1 copper grids (Quantifoil Micro Tools) were glow-discharged for 60 s at 0.2 mbar with 20 mA using a PELCO easiGlow glow discharge system (Ted Pella). Just before deposition of cells on TEM grids, 1.5 μl of poly-lysine solution (Sigma) was applied and ∼2000-6000 cells were deposited onto a grid by pipetting 3-10 μL of detached cells onto the grid. Blotting and plunging was performed in a humidity-controlled room (∼35% relative humidity) using a custom-made plunger (Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry). Grids were blotted manually using #1 Whatman filter paper on the side of the grid opposite to the Quantifoil carbon foil used as substrate for cell growth, and plunged into a 50/50 mixture of liquid ethane and propane (Airgas) cooled to liquid nitrogen temperature. The grids were clipped onto Autogrids (Thermo Fisher Scientific, hereinafter TFS) and samples were kept at liquid nitrogen temperature throughout the experiments.
For cryo-fluorescence microscopy, grids were observed with a CorrSight microscope (TFS) using EC Plan-Neofluar 5x/0.16NA, EC Plan-Neofluar 20x/0.5NA, and EC Plan-Neofluar 40x/0.9NA air objectives (Carl Zeiss Microscopy), an Oligochrome light-source, which emits in 4 different channels (405/488/561/640 nm) (TFS) and a 1344 × 1024 px ORCA-Flash 4.0 camera (Hamamatsu). Data acquisition and processing was performed using MAPS 2.1 (TFS). After acquisition of a grid map at 5X magnification, regions of interest were imaged at 20x or 40x magnification, to identify cells with regions containing LRRK2 filamentous structures.
Micromachining of frozen hydrated cells was performed in a Scios DualBeam FIB/SEM microscope equipped with a prototype cryo stage (TFS), as detailed previously ( Wagner et al., 2020 80. Wagner, F.R. ∙ Watanabe, R. ∙ Schampers, R. ... Preparing samples from whole cells using focused-ion-beam milling for cryo-electron tomography Nat. Protoc. 2020; 15 :2041-2070 Crossref Scopus (81) PubMed Google Scholar ). The sample chamber of the microscope was kept at a pressure below ∼1 × 10 −6 mbar. A low-magnification SEM image encompassing the entire grid using an acceleration voltage of 5 kV, a beam current of 25 pA, and a dwell time of 200 ns was correlated with the grid map from the cryo-light microscope using MAPS 2.1 (TFS) to identify regions of interest on TEM grids. A platinum layer (typically ∼2 μm) was deposited on the sample to improve its conductivity and to reduce streaking on the lamella caused by local variations in mass density that result in variations in lamella thickness, known as curtaining ( Mahamid et al., 2016 52. Mahamid, J. ∙ Pfeffer, S. ∙ Schaffer, M. ... Visualizing the molecular sociology at the HeLa cell nuclear periphery Science. 2016; 351 :969-972 Crossref Scopus (368) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wagner et al., 2020 80.

Protoc. 2020; 15 :2041-2070 Crossref Scopus (81) PubMed Google Scholar ). An integrated gas injection system (GIS) was used to deposit the precursor compound trimethyl(methylcyclopentadienyl)platinum(IV) ( Hayles et al., 2007 38. Hayles, M.F. ∙ Stokes, D.J. ∙ Phifer, D. ... A technique for improved focused ion beam milling of cryo-prepared life science specimens J. Microsc. 2007; 226 :263-269 Crossref Scopus (96) PubMed Google Scholar ; Schaffer et al., 2017 65. Schaffer, M. ∙ Mahamid, J. ∙ Engel, B.D. ... Optimized cryo-focused ion beam sample preparation aimed at in situ structural studies of membrane proteins J. Struct. Biol. 2017; 197 :73-82 Crossref Scopus (159) PubMed Google Scholar ). To this end, the grid was placed 11.5 mm away from the GIS with a nominal stage tilt of 7°, and the GIS was opened for 13 s. Cells were targeted for FIB-milling if they satisfied the following conditions: (1) They showed a filamentous LRRK2 phenotype; (2) they were centered within a grid square, and (3) they were located on a grid square that was at most five squares from the center of the grid (the central ∼1mm 2 area of the grid). The stage was positioned at a nominal tilt of 11-18°, corresponding to a milling angle of 4-11°. FIB milling was performed in three steps with decreasing ion beam currents and a fixed acceleration voltage of 30 kV ( Wagner et al., 2020 80. Wagner, F.R. ∙ Watanabe, R. ∙ Schampers, R. ... Preparing samples from whole cells using focused-ion-beam milling for cryo-electron tomography Nat. Protoc. 2020; 15 :2041-2070 Crossref Scopus (81) PubMed Google Scholar ). For a rough milling step, an ion beam current of 0.3 nA was used. The current was reduced to 0.1 nA for the intermediate step and to 30 pA for fine milling. The target lamella thickness was ∼100 nm. During the milling process, lamella thickness was estimated utilizing thickness-dependent charging effects observed in the SEM images at different acceleration voltages ( Schaffer et al., 2017 65. Schaffer, M. ∙ Mahamid, J. ∙ Engel, B.D. ... Optimized cryo-focused ion beam sample preparation aimed at in situ structural studies of membrane proteins J. Struct. Biol. 2017; 197 :73-82 Crossref Scopus (159) PubMed Google Scholar ). At the end of the session, the grids were transferred out of the FIB/SEM chamber under vacuum and stored in liquid nitrogen.
Tomographic tilt series were recorded in a Tecnai G2 Polara (TFS) equipped with a field emission gun operated at 300 kV, a GIF Quantum 968 post-column energy filter (Gatan) and a K2 Summit 4k × 4k pixel direct electron detector (Gatan). The FIB-milled grids were loaded into the TEM using modified Polara cartridges, which accommodate Autogrids securely ( Rigort et al., 2012 59. Rigort, A. ∙ Bäuerlein, F.J. ∙ Villa, E. ... Focused ion beam micromachining of eukaryotic cells for cryoelectron tomography Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109 :4449-4454 Crossref Scopus (266) PubMed Google Scholar ). The milling slot of each grid was aligned perpendicular to the tilt axis of the microscope ( Wagner et al., 2020 80. Wagner, F.R. ∙ Watanabe, R. ∙ Schampers, R. ... Preparing samples from whole cells using focused-ion-beam milling for cryo-electron tomography Nat. Protoc. 2020; 15 :2041-2070 Crossref Scopus (81) PubMed Google Scholar ). Tilt series were acquired at a target defocus of 5 μm and a pixel size of 2.2 or 3.5 Å using the SerialEM software ( Mastronarde, 2005 55. Mastronarde, D.N. Automated electron microscope tomography using robust prediction of specimen movements J. Struct. Biol. 2005; 152 :36-51 Crossref Scopus (3087) PubMed Google Scholar ) in low-dose mode ( Table S2 ). The dose-symmetric tomography acquisition scheme ( Hagen et al., 2017 37. Hagen, W.J.H. ∙ Wan, W. ∙ Briggs, J.A.G. Implementation of a cryo-electron tomography tilt-scheme optimized for high resolution subtomogram averaging J. Struct. Biol. 2017; 197 :191-198 Crossref Scopus (342) PubMed Google Scholar ) was modified to account for the pre-tilt of the lamella, and to optimize the dose using a SerialEM algorithm that calculates the exposure according to a target average count per image, and does not take the image if the dose per tilt required would exceed a threshold value. The K2 detector was operated in counting and dose fractionation modes, with 0.075 to 0.1 s frames. The target tilt range was set to 120° (±60° starting at the estimated pre-tilt of the lamellae), with increments of 2 or 3°, and a target total electron dose was of 180 e/Å 2 or 120 e/Å 2 respectively ( Table S2 ).
Alignment of the tilt series and tomographic reconstructions were performed using Etomo, part of the IMOD package ( Kremer et al., 1996 48. Kremer, J.R. ∙ Mastronarde, D.N. ∙ McIntosh, J.R. Computer visualization of three-dimensional image data using IMOD J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116 :71-76 Crossref Scopus (3929) PubMed Google Scholar ). Since no fiducial markers were present on the lamellas, tilt-series alignment was performed using patch tracking. Motion correction and dose weighting was performed on each image of the tilt series using MotionCor2 ( Zheng et al., 2017 88. Zheng, S.Q. ∙ Palovcak, E. ∙ Armache, J.P. ... MotionCor2: anisotropic correction of beam-induced motion for improved cryo-electron microscopy Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :331-332 Crossref Scopus (4281) PubMed Google Scholar ); motion-corrected and dose-weighted images were replaced in the aligned tilt series. Tomograms were reconstructed using weighted back-projection. Tomograms were 4x-binned and used for segmentation of membranes using TomSegMemTV ( Martinez-Sanchez et al., 2014 53. Martinez-Sanchez, A. ∙ Garcia, I. ∙ Asano, S. ... Robust membrane detection based on tensor voting for electron tomography Journal of Structural Biology. 2014; 186 :49-61 Crossref Scopus (122) PubMed Google Scholar ) and microtubules using the filament tracing function in Amira (TFS) with the following parameters: cylinder length: 600 Å, angular sampling: 5, mask cylinder radius: 140 Å, outer cylinder radius: 125 Å, inner cylinder radius: 75 Å, and missing wedge according to the individual tilt series. After filament tracing ( Figure S1 A), the resulting center coordinates were re-sampled equidistantly using a script written in MATLAB ( Jasnin et al., 2013 43. Jasnin, M. ∙ Asano, S. ∙ Gouin, E. ... Three-dimensional architecture of actin filaments in Listeria monocytogenes comet tails Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110 :20521-20526 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ). For each point along the filaments, initial Euler angles were assigned for subtomogram analysis. Since microtubules are polar, within a filament all angles were assigned such as the direction along the filament axis was the same for all particles. The Euler angle orthogonal to the axis of the filament, i.e., the angle around the microtubule, was randomized to minimize the effect of the missing wedge (see details below).
To determine the protofilament number of single microtubules, 4x binned tomograms were used for extraction of subtomograms with a box size of 38 nm along the microtubule at 4 nm spacing using Dynamo ( Castaño-Díez et al., 2012 13. Castaño-Díez, D. ∙ Kudryashev, M. ∙ Arheit, M. ... Dynamo: a flexible, user-friendly development tool for subtomogram averaging of cryo-EM data in high-performance computing environments J. Struct. Biol. 2012; 178 :139-151 Crossref Scopus (253) PubMed Google Scholar ), and an initial average for each microtubule was created using the pre-assigned Euler angles described above. Each filament was separately aligned and averaged using Dynamo, using the initial average as a reference. Three iterations of translational and orientational alignment of the first two Euler angles, followed by five iterations of translational alignment and orientational alignment of the third Euler angle around the axis of the microtubule, with the latter restricted to 18-36 degrees, were performed. Particle shifts were limited to 10-20 nm. As this would allow for the particles to shift by 4 nm and result in duplicate particles, we tested barring particle shifts along the helical axis of the filament, and obtained the same overall geometries. However, we used the shifts as described, as they resulted in better resolved features for the analysis. Since this analysis was performed exclusively to obtain the polarity and geometry of the microtubule and LRRK2 helices as described below and we did not actively exclude potential particle duplication that could cause resolution overestimation, we do not report the resolution of the resulting structures. Particles were low-pass filtered to 22-30 Å for alignment. 2D projections along the microtubule axis were calculated in MATLAB, and the 2D projections as well as the 3D averages were visually inspected in MATLAB and IMOD to determine protofilament number and plus/minus end polarity for each microtubule. Assignment of microtubule polarity can be achieved by inspecting a cross section of the averages ( Figure S1 B) from the plus end (‘anti-clockwise slew’ Figure S1 B, left column) or from the minus end (‘clockwise slew’ Figure S1 B, right column) respectively ( Bouchet-Marquis et al., 2007 11. Bouchet-Marquis, C. ∙ Zuber, B. ∙ Glynn, A.M. ... Visualization of cell microtubules in their native state Biol. Cell. 2007; 99 :45-53 Crossref Scopus (75) PubMed Google Scholar ). Microtubules with unclear or ambiguous protofilament number or polarity were discarded. Then, new particles with a box length of ∼70 nm were extracted from 4x binned tomograms, and for each microtubule class (11-, 12- or 13-protofilament microtubules) all particles representing the respective class were submitted to alignment and averaging in Dynamo, using an initial average as a reference. In order to separate decorated microtubules from non-decorated microtubules, multi-reference alignment in Dynamo was conducted using two templates: (1) a LRRK2-decorated microtubule template (the average from the previous step) and (2) a non-decorated microtubule template (the average from the previous step with the density of LRRK2 masked out) using a hollow cylindrical classification mask corresponding to the LRRK2 density ( Figure S1 D). Alignment parameters were used as described above. In order to further improve the structure of LRRK2 bound to microtubules, particles sorted to class 1 (decorated microtubules) were further aligned by using a hollow cylindrical alignment mask that included LRRK2 but excluded the microtubule. For obtaining microtubule averages ( Figure 3 B), all particles (decorated and undecorated) with the same microtubule protofilament number and polarity were aligned by using a cylindrical alignment mask containing only the microtubule region and excluding the LRRK2 helix. The resulting averages ( Figure 3 A) were used to estimate the helical parameters of the LRRK2 double-stranded helix and microtubules as detailed below ( Table S1 ). These averages showed that while the LRRK2 and microtubule helices have different polarities, the number of subunits per turn (11, 12, or 13) is the same for both helices ( Figure 3 A). Because imposing helical symmetry made the LRRK2 helix averages worse (data not shown), we extracted new, smaller subtomograms that would encompass the repeating unit of the LRRK2 helix and the adjacent microtubule region. Since the largest sample corresponded to the 12-protofilament (and 12-LRRK2 repeating units per turn) class, we considered only these helices for further analysis. Coordinates and initial Euler angles of particles along the LRRK2 helical path ( Table S1 ) were used to extract particles from unbinned, dose-weighted tomograms, and used to create an initial average using orientations ( Figure S1 F). CTF corection and 3D refinement of extracted particles was performed in RELION ( Bharat and Scheres, 2016 5. Bharat, T.A. ∙ Scheres, S.H. Resolving macromolecular structures from electron cryo-tomography data using subtomogram averaging in RELION Nat. Protoc. 2016; 11 :2054-2065 Crossref Scopus (154) PubMed Google Scholar ; Bharat et al., 2015 6. Bharat, T.A.M. ∙ Russo, C.J. ∙ Löwe, J. ...

Biol. 2015; 192 :216-221 Crossref Scopus (2721) PubMed Google Scholar ) to create a template for subsequent classification ( Figure S1 G). The resulting density map was used as a reference for 3D classification into three classes, employing a soft mask covering the LRRK2 protomer and a regularization parameter of 2-4 ( Figure S1 H). Class averages were inspected in UCSF Chimera ( Pettersen et al., 2004 57. Pettersen, E.F. ∙ Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ... UCSF Chimera--a visualization system for exploratory research and analysis J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25 :1605-1612 Crossref Scopus (32493) PubMed Google Scholar ), and classes with high levels of noise were excluded. A density corresponding to the ring-shaped WD40 domain was clearly resolved in one class (class 1 in Figure S1 H). Particles belonging to this class were subjected to gold-standard refinement using two different masks (masks A and B; Figures S1 I and S1J) and post-processing without B-factor sharpening in RELION ( Figures S1 K and S1M). Gold-standard Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC) was calculated ( Figures S1 L and S1N) for resolutions of 14.1 Å and 17.6 Å. Local-resolution maps ( Figure 3 D; Figures S1 O and S1P) were calculated using ResMap ( Kucukelbir et al., 2014 50. Kucukelbir, A. ∙ Sigworth, F.J. ∙ Tagare, H.D. Quantifying the local resolution of cryo-EM density maps Nat. Methods. 2014; 11 :63-65 Crossref Scopus (1283) PubMed Google Scholar ). Maps and structures were visualized using UCSF Chimera ( Pettersen et al., 2004 57. Pettersen, E.F. ∙ Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ... UCSF Chimera--a visualization system for exploratory research and analysis J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25 :1605-1612 Crossref Scopus (32493) PubMed Google Scholar ) and VMD ( Humphrey et al., 1996 41. Humphrey, W. ∙ Dalke, A. ∙ Schulten, K. VMD: visual molecular dynamics J Mol Graph. 1996; 14 :33-38 Crossref Scopus (45477) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To calculate the angles and distances between filaments (microtubules), the distances between points sampled every 4 nm along each filament, and all points on all other filaments within the tomogram, were measured. The resulting distance matrix was then reduced to point pairs with distances of 100 nm or less. For each point along a filament, we calculated (1) a tangent vector along the filament at that point, considering the nearest points along the same filament, (2) the distance to the nearest point in each neighboring filament, and (3) the angle between the vectors at these two points, where an angle of zero corresponds to parallel filaments. A 2-D histogram of the distance between filaments versus angle between filaments was calculated in MATLAB.
Helical parameters of non-symmetrized microtubules and LRRK2 helices were obtained using an autocorrelation function as implemented in Dynamo. To obtain the helical parameters for the microtubule and LRRK2 helices, averages were obtained by masking out the volume corresponding to the other helix, i.e ., microtubule helical parameters were obtained using a map that excluded the LRRK2, and vice versa.
LRRK2 is a 286kDa protein formed of seven domains: armadillo (ARM), Ankyrin (ANK) and Leucin-rich repeat (LRR) domains, a Ras of complex proteins (ROC), and C-terminal of ROC domain (COR), kinase (KIN) and a WD40 domains ( Figure 4 A). To determine the architecture of LRRK2(I2020T) bound to microtubules, we used an integrative approach implemented in the open source Integrative Modeling Platform (IMP) package ( Russel et al., 2012 64. Russel, D. ∙ Lasker, K. ∙ Webb, B. ... Putting the pieces together: integrative modeling platform software for structure determination of macromolecular assemblies PLoS Biol. 2012; 10 :e1001244 Crossref Scopus (389) PubMed Google Scholar ). The integrative modeling process consists of four stages: (1) gathering data, (2) choosing how to represent the system and translating the information into spatial restraints, (3) determining an ensemble of structures that satisfy these restraints and, (4) validating the model. This approach has been applied to determine the structure of numerous biological complexes including the 26S proteasome ( Förster et al., 2010 27. Förster, F. ∙ Lasker, K. ∙ Nickell, S. ... Toward an integrated structural model of the 26S proteasome Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2010; 9 :1666-1677 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ), the mediator complex ( Robinson et al., 2015 60. Robinson, P.J. ∙ Trnka, M.J. ∙ Pellarin, R. ... Molecular architecture of the yeast Mediator complex eLife. 2015; 4 :e08719 Crossref Scopus (116) PubMed Google Scholar ) as well as the nuclear pore complex ( Kim et al., 2018 46. Kim, S.J. ∙ Fernandez-Martinez, J. ∙ Nudelman, I. ... Integrative structure and functional anatomy of a nuclear pore complex Nature. 2018; 555 :475-482 Crossref Scopus (338) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, this integrative modeling approach has not, to our knowledge, been applied to solve a previously undetermined structure using in situ cryo-ET.
Given the resolution of the cryo-ET map, the modeling was limited to the location and orientation of the domains within the density, treated as rigid bodies. The clear identification of the characteristic donut shape of the WD40 in the cryo-ET density map provided the starting point for the LRRK2 domains allocation and allowed us to assess that the assignment of the LRRK2 is possible up to the last four domains (WD40, KIN, COR, ROC) while the density related to the LRR, ANK and ARM is visible only at higher threshold, presumably due to their intrinsic flexibility.
Three different types of data were used for structure determination:
A. Cryo-ET map of LRRK2(I2020T) protomer: a 14 Å in situ cryo-ET map was determined as detailed above (EMDB- 20825). The protomer corresponds to a dimer LRRK2 bound to the microtubules ( Figure 3 C).
B. Atomic models of the domains composing LRRK2:
i. X-ray crystallography structure of the human LRRK2 WD40 dimer ( Zhang et al., 2019 87. Zhang, P. ∙ Fan, Y. ∙ Ru, H. ... Crystal structure of the WD40 domain dimer of LRRK2 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2019; 116 :1579-1584 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ) (PDB: 6DLP )
ii. Homology model of the kinase domain of human LRRK2 (Uniprot ID Q5S007 , residue 1883-2135). We generated models for both the active and inactive conformations. The models were generated by homology modeling with SWISS-MODEL ( Benkert et al., 2011 2. Benkert, P. ∙ Biasini, M. ∙ Schwede, T.

The crystal structure of the Roco4 Kinase domain bound to AppCp from D. discoideum was used as a template for the kinase-active (closed) model (PDB: 4F0F , homology 43%), and the the crystal structure Roco4 kinase domain from D. discoideum (PDB: 4F0G , homology 43%) was used as a template for the kinase-inactive (open) model ( Gilsbach et al., 2012 30.

USA. 2012; 109 :10322-10327 Crossref Scopus (85) PubMed Google Scholar ). Alignment was generated by ClustalOmega ( Sievers et al., 2011 71. Sievers, F. ∙ Wilm, A. ∙ Dineen, D. ... Fast, scalable generation of high-quality protein multiple sequence alignments using Clustal Omega Mol. Syst. Biol. 2011; 7 :539 Crossref Scopus (10543) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S4 ). Our initial integrative modeling used an active conformation of the kinase based on the fact that the LRRK2-specific Type-1 inhibitors MLi-2 and LRRK2-IN-1, which bind to the active form, increase filament formation ( Blanca Ramírez et al., 2017 9.

iii. A model of the monomeric ROCCOR domain of human LRRK2 protein (Uniprot ID Q5S007 , residue 1332-1838 was obtained by homology modeling with SWISS-MODEL ( Benkert et al., 2011 2.

Bio3d: an R package for the comparative analysis of protein structures Bioinformatics. 2006; 22 :2695-2696 Crossref Scopus (1257) PubMed Google Scholar ) was performed on the ROCCOR template revealing a hinge in the COR domain (L1669-I1689) which corresponds to a missing loop area in the template PDB structure. Therefore, we split the ROCCOR domain into three separate rigid bodies namely, COR C , COR N , and ROC ( Gotthardt et al., 2008 32. Gotthardt, K. ∙ Weyand, M. ∙ Kortholt, A. ... Structure of the Roc-COR domain tandem of C. tepidum, a prokaryotic homologue of the human LRRK2 Parkinson kinase EMBO J. 2008; 27 :2239-2249 Crossref Scopus (107) PubMed Google Scholar ). (PDB: 3DPU , homology 37%, 37% and 38% respectively; Figure S4 and S5). We did not directly use human ROC domain structure ( Deng et al., 2008 18. Deng, J. ∙ Lewis, P.A. ∙ Greggio, E. ... Structure of the ROC domain from the Parkinson’s disease-associated leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 reveals a dimeric GTPase Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105 :1499-1504 Crossref Scopus (199) PubMed Google Scholar ) (PDB: 2ZEJ ) due to the potential domain swapping described earlier ( Gotthardt et al., 2008 32. Gotthardt, K. ∙ Weyand, M. ∙ Kortholt, A. ... Structure of the Roc-COR domain tandem of C. tepidum, a prokaryotic homologue of the human LRRK2 Parkinson kinase EMBO J. 2008; 27 :2239-2249 Crossref Scopus (107) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, we replaced the coordinates of the region not involved in this interface (residues 1425-1441 and 1474-1457) in the final models of the ensemble.
C. Since all the domains are part of a single polypeptide chain of LRRK2, the amino acid stretches between the domains were considered as linkers connecting the N- and C- termini of consecutive domains. A worm-like chain model ( Flory, (1953) 26. Flory, P.J. Principles of Polymer Chemistry Cornell University Press, 1953 Google Scholar ) was used to model the connecting linkers, with an average end-to-end distance of 2 √ 𝑁 ∗ 𝑙 , where N is the number of amino acids and l = 3.1Å is the length of one amino acid measured as the typical average distance between alpha carbons of adjacent amino acids ( Figure S5 ).
Each domain was represented as a rigid body at atomic resolution. Five types of spatial restraints were used during monomer configuration and dimer refinement in Stage 3.
i. Cryo-ET density restraint : (a) an IMP scoring term that considers the percentage of atoms that are included in the map, used both in monomer configuration and refinement. (b) Cross correlation of model to map implemented in MDFF ( Trabuco et al., 2008 79. Trabuco, L.G. ∙ Villa, E. ∙ Mitra, K. ... Flexible fitting of atomic structures into electron microscopy maps using molecular dynamics Structure. 2008; 16 :673-683 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (699) PubMed Google Scholar ), used to select models in monomer configuration.
ii. Location of WD40: based on the characteristic donut shapes in the density and a rigid-body fit of the crystal structure of the human LRRK2 WD40 dimer to the density, the WD40 could be unequivocally located in the cryo-ET density map (see below) and thus its location was constrained to that region in the map ( Figure S5 ), used in monomer configuration.
iii. Chain connectivity restraints : distance restraints between the C-term and N-term of consecutive domains as described above ( Figure S5 ), used both in monomer configuration and dimer refinement.
iv. Excluded volume restraints : Overlap between domains is assessed as an excluded volume restraint (steric clashes of alpha carbons of less than 10% and 5%), used both in monomer configuration and dimer refinement respectively.
v. Dimer symmetry restraints : (a) Overlap between monomers was assessed using excluded volume (steric clashes of less that 10% of alpha carbon atoms between LRRK2 monomers), and used in the final stage of monomer configuration. (b) Symmetry restraints implemented in IMP were used during dimer refinement.
To create an ensemble of LRRK dimers that incorporates the data available and satisfies the restraints, we applied a sampling protocol consisting of two steps: monomer configuration and dimer refinement.
A. Monomer configuration . To determine the monomer configuration we used the MultiFit module of IMP ( Lasker et al., 2009 51. Lasker, K. ∙ Topf, M. ∙ Sali, A. ... Inferential optimization for simultaneous fitting of multiple components into a CryoEM map of their assembly J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 388 :180-194 Crossref Scopus (100) PubMed Google Scholar ). First, rigid-body fitting of each of the individual five domains to a dimer protomer map were sampled at 5° resolution using colores ( Chacón and Wriggers, 2002 15. Chacón, P. ∙ Wriggers, W. Multi-resolution contour-based fitting of macromolecular structures J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317 :375-384 Crossref Scopus (296) PubMed Google Scholar ). The best 10,000 fits for WD40, ROC, COR N and COR C and 5,000 fits for KIN were considered. Additionally, the crystal structure of the human LRRK2 WD40 dimer (PDB: 6DLP ) ( Zhang et al., 2019 87. Zhang, P. ∙ Fan, Y. ∙ Ru, H. ... Crystal structure of the WD40 domain dimer of LRRK2 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2019; 116 :1579-1584 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ) was rigid body fitted using the same parameters. Rigid-body fitting the WD40 dimer (PDB: 6DLP ) into the cryo-ET density using the same parameters as above resulted in an unequivocal best fit that matched the WD40 monomers into the donut shaped regions of the map, revealing the same orientation between the monomers as in the crystal structure ( Figure 3 E). Thus, the WD40 fits for the monomer were filtered to be placed within the donut-shaped density to satisfy constraint ii. From these fits, we selected a single position and orientation that matched that of the dimer in the dimer crystal structure ( Zhang et al., 2019 87. Zhang, P. ∙ Fan, Y. ∙ Ru, H. ... Crystal structure of the WD40 domain dimer of LRRK2 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2019; 116 :1579-1584 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ). Second, we looked at all 5000 fits of the active kinase and selected those that satisfied the distance linker of 9 Å (restraint iii). Only six fits satisfied this restraint, and they had an RMSD of 4.7Å between them. Considering the resolution of our map, they were equivalent, and thus we used a single kinase fit for the subsequent steps to reduce computational time. Next, the fits for ROC, COR N and COR C were filtered to include only those fitted to the same monomer within the protomer map, and not overlapping with the placed WD40 and kinase, yielding 1188, 1446 and 1148 models respectively. MultiFit was then used to sample all possible combinations of the ROC, COR N and COR C domain fits and scored for spatial restraints i(a), iii and iv. A total of three million models were initially scored. From that, we filtered the solutions based on respecting the N-C distance (restraint iii) and having not major compenetration between domains (restraint iv; corresponding to an EV score of < 100,000). This yielded 786,211 models.
Third, the ensemble was clustered based on an RMSD of 8 Å, leading to 256 clusters, that could be further classified into classes of different architectures, i.e., swaps between ROC, COR N and COR C domains. Next, the models were filtered to allow only clashes of up to 10% of the alpha carbons between domains as measured in VMD. From here, only two clusters remained, one with 31,140 models, and the other with 394 models. These two clusters differed in the location of the COR C and ROC domains ( Figure S2 ).
Fourth, dimers were built from each monomer by applying a symmetry transformation determined from the cryo-ET map. All models in the second cluster had major clashes at the dimer interface. Thus, only one ensemble of 31,140 models remained corresponding to the same domain architecture. The ensemble was filtered to satisfy restraints i, iii, iv, and v(a), resulting in 1,167 dimer models.
B. Dimer refinement. We generated an ensemble of LRRK2 dimers as detailed above. We then clustered the ensemble of 1,167 dimers into 53 clusters based on an RMSD of 8 Å. From each cluster, we refined a dimer using a simulated-annealing Monte-Carlo (MC) protocol implemented in IMP. During the refinement, local perturbations in positions and orientations of the ten rigid bodies were sampled and assessed using a scoring function including terms i-v. Minima from the refinement protocol were gathered and used in the refined ensemble assessment (stage 4).
Our extensive sampling rendered a single architecture of LRR2 dimers. In order to validate this structure, we first looked at the overall conformation and its congruency with other available data. We found that our model agrees with the following independent observations:
i. The LRR domain fits into the density and is in the proximity of the ROC domain ( Figure 4 H). The LRR model corresponds to residues 129-444 of the LRR in a crystal structure of a homologous Roco protein (PDB: 6HLU ), and was fitted using the rigid-body fitting function of Chimera ( Pettersen et al., 2004 57. Pettersen, E.F. ∙ Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ... UCSF Chimera--a visualization system for exploratory research and analysis J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25 :1605-1612 Crossref Scopus (32493) PubMed Google Scholar ).
ii. The ROC domain is proximal to the microtubules, consistent with observations that the ROC domain of LRRK2 is sufficient for interaction with tubulin heterodimers ( Gandhi et al., 2008 29. Gandhi, P.N. ∙ Wang, X. ∙ Zhu, X. ... The Roc domain of leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 is sufficient for interaction with microtubules J. Neurosci. Res. 2008; 86 :1711-1720 Crossref Scopus (145) PubMed Google Scholar ).
iii. The dimerization of the WD40 observed in a recent crystal structure ( Zhang et al., 2019 87. Zhang, P. ∙ Fan, Y. ∙ Ru, H. ... Crystal structure of the WD40 domain dimer of LRRK2 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2019; 116 :1579-1584 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ) matches the architecture in our model, and is consistent with our data showing no filament formation ( Figure 5 ). Although we used the crystal structure to assign the overall region occupied by the WD40, a preliminary global alignment using MultiFit (data not shown) confirmed the best conformation of the WD40 to fit that of the dimer crystal structure.
iv. The configuration of ROCCOR of our LRRK2 models obtained by integrative modeling is similar to the locations of those domains within a monomer in the crystal structure of the bacterial homolog (PDB: 6HLU ) ( Deyaert et al., 2019 20. Deyaert, E. ∙ Leemans, M. ∙ Singh, R.K. ... Structure and nucleotide-induced conformational dynamics of the Chlorobium tepidum Roco protein Biochem. J. 2019; 476 :51-66 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ) even though the humanized ROC and COR domains (further separated as COR N and COR C ) were modeled as separate units during integrative modeling.
The monomer ensemble consisting of 1,167 models was analyzed to assess the uncertainty on the positions and orientations of each domain ( Figure S6 ). The analysis on the variability showed a narrow conformational space visited by COR, COR C and a broader conformational space visited by ROC ( Figure S6 ). During refinement, the spread of the conformational variability was further constricted without major rearrangements. Thus, the ensemble reflects the variability of the structure given the available experimental data.
The average RMSD distribution between the ROCCOR of the C. tepidum Roco protein and the 53 clusters of LRRK2 models were calculated. Conformational space analysis on the lowest RMSD LRRK2 models (cluster 20) showed that the COR C and COR N domains were found in the same orientation as in the bacterial ROCCOR structure, and again found that the ROC domain explored a vaster conformational space. The conformational variability of the ROC domain observed in our data was previously described in the X-ray structure (PDB: 3DPU ) where the ROC domain was solved only for one of the two monomers.
Altogether, we determined the architecture of LRRK2, with certainty in the location of the domains, and varying uncertainty in their orientation, as expected from the resolution of our data. The molecular models represented throughout the manuscript depict one of the models in cluster 20. For each of the clusters, we selected a snapshot of the refinement and deposited the alpha-carbon coordinates to the Protein Data Bank (53 models in PDB 6XR4 ). The snapshots were selected so that the scoring function and the RMSD to the bacterial ROCCOR structure improved. However, due to the uncertainty of our data, the variability of the ensemble should be considered ( Figure S6 ). The full monomer ensemble and dimer refinement runs are available upon request, as depositing these entire data is currently not possible in the Protein Data Bank.
We also evaluated the effect of the functional state of the kinase in our LRRK2 models. Our workflow first considered an active (closed) kinase conformation based on previous experiments that link the filament formation to the ATP-bound active-like state of the kinase ( Scott et al., 2017 69. Scott, J.D. ∙ DeMong, D.E. ∙ Greshock, T.J. ... Discovery of a 3-(4-Pyrimidinyl) Indazole (MLi-2), an Orally Available and Selective Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase 2 (LRRK2) Inhibitor that Reduces Brain Kinase Activity J. Med. Chem. 2017; 60 :2983-2992 Crossref Scopus (101) PubMed Google Scholar ; Williamson et al., 2017 83. Williamson, D.S. ∙ Smith, G.P. ∙ Acheson-Dossang, P. ... Design of Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase 2 (LRRK2) Inhibitors Using a Crystallographic Surrogate Derived from Checkpoint Kinase 1 (CHK1) J. Med. Chem. 2017; 60 :8945-8962 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ), and the fact that LRRK2(I2020T) is known to cause hyper-kinase activity in cells ( Blanca Ramírez et al., 2017 9. Blanca Ramírez, M. ∙ Lara Ordóñez, A.J. ∙ Fdez, E. ... GTP binding regulates cellular localization of Parkinson’s disease-associated LRRK2 Hum. Mol. Genet. 2017; 26 :2747-2767 Crossref Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kett et al., 2012 45. Kett, L.R. ∙ Boassa, D. ∙ Ho, C.C. ... LRRK2 Parkinson disease mutations enhance its microtubule association Hum. Mol. Genet. 2012; 21 :890-899 Crossref Scopus (154) PubMed Google Scholar ; Steger et al., 2016 73. Steger, M. ∙ Tonelli, F. ∙ Ito, G. ... Phosphoproteomics reveals that Parkinson’s disease kinase LRRK2 regulates a subset of Rab GTPases eLife. 2016; 5 :e12813 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). In order to verify our assumption, we investigated the effect of using an inactive kinase domain model. First, we built a humanized inactive (open) kinase model using PDB ID 4F0G (open/inactive Roco4 Kinase domain from D. discoideum ) using Swissmodel as described above. Next, we replaced the inactive kinase model in of 786K models generated in the second step of monomer refinement, as this is equivalent to running the full integrative modeling exercise with significantly lower computational cost. The replacement of the active by the inactive model was done by aligning it to the C-terminal part of the active kinase model we used previously, given that the linker between the WD40 and the C-terminal of the kinase is the most stringent restraint. The same analysis, namely clustering and excluding models based on domain clashes within the monomer followed by building dimers and excluding based on clashes between monomers, was performed using the kinase-inactive model. At every step, the subset of models that conformed to the restraints was between 50%–67% the size of that for the kinase active conformation. The final ensemble had 786 models with the same overall architecture (location of the domains). In order to have a direct comparison between the ensembles with active-like and inactive-like kinase conformations, we selected the models that were present in both ensembles and calculated the clashes between the kinase and the ROCCOR domains by measuring the percentage of backbone atoms that were within 5 Å using VMD. The number of clashes in the inactive conformations was 17% higher than the active conformation in all models. Altogether, our analysis suggests that our cryo-ET map of LRRK2(I2020T) bound to microtubules represents a kinase-active state of LRRK2.
For transient protein expression of N-terminally Halo-tagged full-length wild-type and G2385R LRRK2, HEK293T cells were plated onto 6-well dishes containing poly-D-lysine-coated glass coverslips or onto poly-D-lysine-coated glass-bottom culture dishes (MatTek Corporation, Ashland, MA, USA, Cat. No. P35GC-0–14-C) and allowed to grow to 40%–50% confluency. Cells were transfected using the Lipofectamine 3000 transfection kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s protocol using 1 μg of tagged Halo-LRRK2 DNAs. After 48 h, cells were treated with the LRRK2 inhibitor MLi-2 (100 nM) for 2 h and then labeled with the TMR ligand (3 μM) (Promega). After 15 min, cells were washed with fresh media and then fixed with pre-warmed (37°C) 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed in PBS and mounted with an in-house made antifade agent gelvatol. Confocal imaging was performed with an inverted Olympus Fluoview 1000 laser scanning confocal microscope using a 561 nm laser line and a 60X oil immersion objective lens with numerical aperture 1.42. Z stack images were acquired with a step size of 0.3 microns and processed using the Fiji software package ( Schindelin et al., 2012 67. Schindelin, J. ∙ Arganda-Carreras, I. ∙ Frise, E. ... Fiji: an open-source platform for biological-image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :676-682 Crossref Scopus (38214) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cells expressing the different LRRK2 mutants were assessed for the presence of clear filamentous structures and quantified in three independent experiments.
The details of the quantification and all statistical analyses are included in the relevant sections of the METHOD DETAILS .
