Title: Structural Basis of WLS/Evi-Mediated Wnt Transport and Secretion


Abstract: Summary

Wnts are evolutionarily conserved ligands that signal at short range to regulate morphogenesis, cell fate, and stem cell renewal. The first and essential steps in Wnt secretion are their O-palmitoleation and subsequent loading onto the dedicated transporter Wntless/evenness interrupted (WLS/Evi). We report the 3.2 Å resolution cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of palmitoleated human WNT8A in complex with WLS. This is accompanied by biochemical experiments to probe the physiological implications of the observed association. The WLS membrane domain has close structural homology to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). A Wnt hairpin inserts into a conserved hydrophobic cavity in the GPCR-like domain, and the palmitoleate protrudes between two helices into the bilayer. A conformational switch of highly conserved residues on a separate Wnt hairpin might contribute to its transfer to receiving cells. This work provides molecular-level insights into a central mechanism in animal body plan development and stem cell biology.

Section: Introduction

Wnts are a family of secreted, lipid-modified glycoproteins that regulate morphogenesis, stemness, and cell fate decisions. Upon reaching the membrane of a producing cell, Wnts travel locally through the extracellular space to nearby signal-receiving cells, where they interact with a diversity of cell-surface receptors, including a family of 10 human Frizzleds, as well as an increasing array of Wnt co-receptors such as LRP5/6 and the receptor tyrosine kinase ROR2 ( Langton et al., 2016 40.

Routledge, D. ∙ Scholpp, S. Mechanisms of intercellular Wnt transport Development. 2019; 146 :1-10 Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar ). The Wnt-receptor interaction, in turn, triggers several different downstream signaling cascades, including the stabilization of β-catenin, regulating changes in gene expression, and activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), regulating changes in cell polarity. The multiple roles of Wnt family members in body plan development and homeostasis across all animal species is highlighted by the diverse number of conserved paralogs in different organisms; for example, the human and mouse genomes have 19 Wnt genes, whereas the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis , a cnidarian branch occurring prior to the advent of bilaterality, has at least 12 ( Kusserow et al., 2005 38.

A central feature of Wnt biology is the requirement for covalent attachment of a mono-unsaturated palmitoleate (PAM) to a serine residue that is conserved in essentially all Wnts ( Takada et al., 2006 69. Takada, R. ∙ Satomi, Y. ∙ Kurata, T. ... Monounsaturated fatty acid modification of Wnt protein: its role in Wnt secretion Dev. Cell. 2006; 11 :791-801 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (612) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 1 A). This unusual protein O-acylation renders Wnt proteins highly hydrophobic and dependent on carriers for intra- and inter-cellular movement ( Hannoush, 2015 25. Hannoush, R.N. Synthetic protein lipidation Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2015; 28 :39-46 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ). Wnt palmitoleation is catalyzed in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by the membrane-bound O-acyltransferase (MBOAT) porcupine (PORCN) ( Kadowaki et al., 1996 33. Kadowaki, T. ∙ Wilder, E. ∙ Klingensmith, J. ...

Mutations in the segment polarity genes wingless and porcupine impair secretion of the wingless protein EMBO J. 1993; 12 :5293-5302 Crossref Scopus (217) PubMed Google Scholar ) in a reaction that requires mono-unsaturated palmitate in the form of palmitoleoyl-coenzyme A (CoA) ( Rios-Esteves and Resh, 2013 57.

After acylation, Wnts become competent to bind in the ER to the conserved membrane transport protein variously known as Wntless (WLS), Evi, and GPR177 for transport across cellular compartments and secretion ( Figure 1 A; Bartscherer et al., 2006 6.

Although multiple genes encode functional Wnts and their receptors, the secretory modules of PORCN and WLS are each encoded by a single essential gene in all animal genomes. WLS is an integral membrane protein predicted to have eight transmembrane (TM) helices, with an extended luminal loop that has been shown to be essential for Wnt binding, and an ER recycling motif at the cytoplasmic C terminus ( Bartscherer et al., 2006 6.

Cell. 2014; 29 :277-291 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (103) PubMed Google Scholar ). WLS has also been called GPR177 because of a proposed homology to G protein-coupled receptors ( Gloriam et al., 2007 19. Gloriam, D.E. ∙ Fredriksson, R. ∙ Schiöth, H.B. The G protein-coupled receptor subset of the rat genome BMC Genomics. 2007; 8 :338 Crossref Scopus (176) PubMed Google Scholar ). PORCN-catalyzed acylation of Wnts is absolutely required for them to bind to WLS in the ER ( Coombs et al., 2010 11. Coombs, G.S. ∙ Yu, J. ∙ Canning, C.A. ...

A uniform human Wnt expression library reveals a shared secretory pathway and unique signaling activities Differentiation. 2012; 84 :203-213 Crossref Scopus (123) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mutations in the Wnt palmitoleation site, inhibition of PORCN, and downregulation of WLS expression prevent Wnt ER exit and secretion ( Moti et al., 2019 47. Moti, N. ∙ Yu, J. ∙ Boncompain, G. ...

Cell. 2014; 29 :277-291 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (103) PubMed Google Scholar ). Loss-of-function mutations in PORCN , an X-linked gene, are lethal in males ( Grzeschik et al., 2007 24. Grzeschik, K.H. ∙ Bornholdt, D. ∙ Oeffner, F. ... Deficiency of PORCN, a regulator of Wnt signaling, is associated with focal dermal hypoplasia Nat.

Mutations in X-linked PORCN, a putative regulator of Wnt signaling, cause focal dermal hypoplasia Nat. Genet. 2007; 39 :836-838 Crossref Scopus (231) PubMed Google Scholar ), whereas drugs that inhibit PORCN are effective treatments for Wnt-addicted cancers in preclinical models and are currently in ongoing clinical trials ( Zhong and Virshup, 2020 88. Zhong, Z. ∙ Virshup, D.M. Wnt Signaling and Drug Resistance in Cancer Mol. Pharmacol. 2020; 97 :72-89 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Similarly, whole-body knockout (KO) of Wls is lethal in mice ( Fu et al., 2009 17. Fu, J. ∙ Jiang, M. ∙ Mirando, A.J. ... Reciprocal regulation of Wnt and Gpr177/mouse Wntless is required for embryonic axis formation Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106 :18598-18603 Crossref Scopus (172) PubMed Google Scholar ), and tissue-specific KO models display various Wnt-related phenotypes ( Carpenter et al., 2010 9. Carpenter, A.C. ∙ Rao, S. ∙ Wells, J.M. ... Generation of mice with a conditional null allele for Wntless Genesis. 2010; 48 :554-558 Crossref Scopus (122) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhong et al., 2012 89.

USA. 2012; 109 :E2197-E2204 Crossref Scopus (136) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, the PORCN-WLS acylation-secretion module is required and essential for all Wnt functions.
Wnts are short-range signaling molecules, and the role of WLS in this process remains unclear. In the journey from the ER to the plasma membrane, the Wnt-WLS complex traverses the Golgi apparatus, where additional Wnt glycosylation occurs, to reach the plasma membrane. Wnt glycosylation might determine differential targeting of the Wnt-WLS complex to different exit sites on polarized cells ( Yamamoto et al., 2013 81. Yamamoto, H. ∙ Awada, C. ∙ Hanaki, H. ... The apical and basolateral secretion of Wnt11 and Wnt3a in polarized epithelial cells is regulated by different mechanisms J. Cell Sci. 2013; 126 :2931-2943 Crossref Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ). The covalently attached O-PAM restricts how Wnts travel after they reach the cell membrane, where they must be transported by one of several forms of facilitated diffusion to reach their receptors on neighboring cells. The Wnt-WLS complex might transfer Wnts to cell-surface proteoglycans, soluble transport proteins, cytonemes, or exosomes ( McGough et al., 2020 46. McGough, I.J. ∙ Vecchia, L. ∙ Bishop, B. ... Glypicans shield the Wnt lipid moiety to enable signalling at a distance Nature. 2020; 585 :85-90 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ; Routledge and Scholpp, 2019 59. Routledge, D. ∙ Scholpp, S. Mechanisms of intercellular Wnt transport Development. 2019; 146 :1-10 Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar ). Ultimately, in a step that is again dependent on the presence of the O-PAM, Wnts are delivered to Frizzled (FZD) and its associated co-receptors on the surface of the receiving cells to initiate downstream signaling ( Niehrs, 2012 49. Niehrs, C. The complex world of WNT receptor signalling Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2012; 13 :767-779 Crossref Scopus (1125) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yu and Virshup, 2014 86. Yu, J. ∙ Virshup, D.M. Updating the Wnt pathways Bioscience Reports. 2014; 34 Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar ). WLS can then recycle from the plasma membrane back to the ER for additional cycles of Wnt transport ( Belenkaya et al., 2008 8. Belenkaya, T.Y. ∙ Wu, Y. ∙ Tang, X. ...

Structural studies of Wnt pathway proteins have provided important insights into how signal transduction occurs. Given the fact that acylated Wnts are highly insoluble, the structure of palmitoleated Wnt was first determined only after it was purified in a complex bound to its receptor, the cysteine-rich domain (CRD) of FZD ( Hirai et al., 2019 27. Hirai, H. ∙ Matoba, K. ∙ Mihara, E. ... Crystal structure of a mammalian Wnt-frizzled complex Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2019; 26 :372-379 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar ; Janda et al., 2012 32. Janda, C.Y. ∙ Waghray, D. ∙ Levin, A.M. ... Structural basis of Wnt recognition by Frizzled Science. 2012; 337 :59-64 Crossref Scopus (647) PubMed Google Scholar ). There, the PAM lies in a hydrophobic groove in the CRD in the extracellular space, where it might provide a signal for receptor dimerization ( Nile et al., 2017 50. Nile, A.H. ∙ Mukund, S. ∙ Stanger, K. ... Unsaturated fatty acyl recognition by Frizzled receptors mediates dimerization upon Wnt ligand binding Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :4147-4152 Crossref Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar ). The structures of xWnt8 and WNT3 in complex with the FZD CRD, coupled with evolutionary analysis, revealed that Wnts are composed of two major domains ( Bazan et al., 2012 7. Bazan, J.F. ∙ Janda, C.Y. ∙ Garcia, K.C. Structural architecture and functional evolution of Wnts Dev. Cell. 2012; 23 :227-232 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hirai et al., 2019 27. Hirai, H. ∙ Matoba, K. ∙ Mihara, E. ...

Janda, C.Y. ∙ Waghray, D. ∙ Levin, A.M. ... Structural basis of Wnt recognition by Frizzled Science. 2012; 337 :59-64 Crossref Scopus (647) PubMed Google Scholar ). An amino-terminal core domain (NTD) distantly related to saposins contains multiple helices in an anti-parallel bundle from which extend hairpin 1 and the PAM-containing hairpin 2. The carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) comprises hairpin 3 and is structurally related to cysteine-knot growth factors. Wnt hairpins 1 and 2 contact FZD CRD site 1, and hairpin 3 contacts CRD site 2. Isolated Wnt NTD or CTD constructs can interfere with Wnt signaling, suggesting that they retain some ability to compete with intact Wnts for binding to the CRD ( Hoppler et al., 1996 29. Hoppler, S. ∙ Brown, J.D. ∙ Moon, R.T.

Molecular dissection of Wnt3a-Frizzled8 interaction reveals essential and modulatory determinants of Wnt signaling activity BMC Biol. 2014; 12 :44 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, isolated hairpin 3 of the CTD can interact with the FZD CRD and function as a mini-Wnt, and mutation of highly conserved residues on its tip impairs signaling ability ( Janda et al., 2012 32. Janda, C.Y. ∙ Waghray, D. ∙ Levin, A.M. ... Structural basis of Wnt recognition by Frizzled Science. 2012; 337 :59-64 Crossref Scopus (647) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kumar et al., 2014 37.

How a newly palmitoleated Wnt is transferred from PORCN to WLS, how the three components (Wnt, the O-PAM, and WLS) assemble in an energetically favorable and transport-efficient complex, and how Wnt is transferred from WLS to various transporters and to FZD on the neighboring cell remains poorly understood.

Section: Results

To gain structural insights into the association of palmitoleated Wnts with WLS, multiple Wnts were screened for expression and complex formation with WLS by transient transfection of mammalian cells. We chose to work on human WNT8A and human WLS on the basis of the activity, expression levels, and detergent stability of the complex ( Figures S1 A–S1C). We confirmed that formation of the palmitoleation-dependent WNT8A-WLS complex is required to transport both components to the cell surface ( Figure 1 B) ( Coombs et al., 2010 11. Coombs, G.S. ∙ Yu, J. ∙ Canning, C.A. ... WLS-dependent secretion of WNT3A requires Ser209 acylation and vacuolar acidification J.

Biol. 2012; 361 :392-402 Crossref Scopus (148) PubMed Google Scholar ). WNT8A and WLS were co-expressed in a suspension-adapted Human Embryonic Kidney 293 (HEK293S) cell line lacking N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (GnTI − ) ( Reeves et al., 2002 56. Reeves, P.J. ∙ Callewaert, N. ∙ Contreras, R. ...

Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99 :13419-13424 Crossref Scopus (539) PubMed Google Scholar ) by co-transduction of two separate baculoviruses prepared with the BacMam system ( Goehring et al., 2014 21. Goehring, A. ∙ Lee, C.-H. ∙ Wang, K.H. ... Screening and large-scale expression of membrane proteins in mammalian cells for structural studies Nat. Protoc. 2014; 9 :2574-2585 Crossref Scopus (433) PubMed Google Scholar ). The WNT8A-WLS complex was purified in detergent and reconstituted in lipid-filled nanodiscs by using a different affinity tag on each protein to ensure a homogeneous preparation ( Figures S1 D–S1F). The structure of the 101-kDa WNT8A-WLS complex was determined to a nominal resolution of 3.2 Å by single-particle cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) ( Figure 1 C; Figure S2 ; Table S1 ). A model was built comprising residues 4–496 from the 541-amino acid WLS and residues 30–337 of the 351-amino acid WNT8A ( Figures 1 D and 1E; Figure S3 ), lacking the C-terminal tail of WLS (residues 497–541) and three loop segments in WNT8A (115–125, 223–240, and 279–287), which were disordered.
The structure of WNT8A-bound human WLS reveals two distinct components: an integral membrane domain composed of eight TM helices with N and C termini on the cytosolic side and a globular luminal domain (WLS LD) between TM1 and TM2, known to be required for Wnt binding ( Figures 1 D and 1E) ( Coombs et al., 2010 11. Coombs, G.S. ∙ Yu, J. ∙ Canning, C.A. ... WLS-dependent secretion of WNT3A requires Ser209 acylation and vacuolar acidification J. Cell Sci. 2010; 123 :3357-3367 Crossref Scopus (158) PubMed Google Scholar ). The WLS LD, largely encoded by exons 2–4 ( Figure S4 ), forms a compact structure of eight antiparallel β sheets, resembling a β sandwich ( Figures 1 D and 1E). There are four cysteines in the WLS LD that are conserved in essentially all eukaryotic WLS ( Figure S4 ). They appear to form two disulfide bonds, linking β strands 5 and 6 and stabilizing the loop region between β strands 1 and 2 ( Figure S5 A). Mutation of any of these cysteines markedly impairs WLS activity ( Figure S5 B). WLS has a conserved clathrin-mediated endocytosis motif, YXXΦ, at residue Tyr425, where Φ is a bulky hydrophobic residue ( Gasnereau et al., 2011 18. Gasnereau, I. ∙ Herr, P. ∙ Chia, P.Z.C. ... Identification of an endocytosis motif in an intracellular loop of Wntless protein, essential for its recycling and the control of Wnt protein signaling J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286 :43324-43333 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yu et al., 2014 84. Yu, J. ∙ Chia, J. ∙ Canning, C.A. ... WLS retrograde transport to the endoplasmic reticulum during Wnt secretion Dev. Cell. 2014; 29 :277-291 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (103) PubMed Google Scholar ). This motif is located on an intracellular loop between TM helices 6 and 7, conceivably well positioned to engage with the endocytosis machinery ( Figure S5 A).
A structural homology search reveals that the WLS LD resembles seipin (root-mean-square deviation [RMSD] of ∼1.3 Å), an ancient ER protein involved in lipid droplet formation ( Figure S5 C) ( Sui et al., 2018 65. Sui, X. ∙ Arlt, H. ∙ Brock, K.P. ... Cryo-electron microscopy structure of the lipid droplet-formation protein seipin J. Cell Biol. 2018; 217 :4080-4091 Crossref Scopus (129) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yan et al., 2018 82. Yan, R. ∙ Qian, H. ∙ Lukmantara, I. ... Human SEIPIN Binds Anionic Phospholipids Dev. Cell. 2018; 47 :248-256.e4 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (144) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, seipin appears to also be topologically similar, with two TM domain anchors flanking eight antiparallel β sheets in the ER lumen, closely resembling the TM1-WLS LD-TM2 arrangement observed in WLS. Consistent with the proposed origins of Wnts from lipid-sensing pathways, the WLS seipin homology domain makes contacts with the helical core of Wnt, which has structural homology to saposins, another ancient protein implicated in lipid metabolism ( Bazan et al., 2012 7. Bazan, J.F. ∙ Janda, C.Y. ∙ Garcia, K.C. Structural architecture and functional evolution of Wnts Dev. Cell. 2012; 23 :227-232 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Different Wnts are N-glycosylated at several distinct sites, and this glycosylation might play a role in Wnt-WLS sorting during secretion ( Yamamoto et al., 2013 81. Yamamoto, H. ∙ Awada, C. ∙ Hanaki, H. ... The apical and basolateral secretion of Wnt11 and Wnt3a in polarized epithelial cells is regulated by different mechanisms J. Cell Sci. 2013; 126 :2931-2943 Crossref Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our structure shows two sites on WNT8A, Asn103 and Asn262, that contain N-linked glycans ( Figures 2 A and 2B). These residues are similarly glycosylated in the xWnt8 structure ( Janda et al., 2012 32. Janda, C.Y. ∙ Waghray, D. ∙ Levin, A.M. ...

The Asn103 site is unique to the WNT8 family, whereas Asn262 is also found in WNT5A/B (Asn312 of human WNT5A) ( Figure S7 ). The glycan attached to Asn262 is near the proposed LRP5/6 binding site ( Hirai et al., 2019 27. Hirai, H. ∙ Matoba, K. ∙ Mihara, E. ... Crystal structure of a mammalian Wnt-frizzled complex Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2019; 26 :372-379 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar ) and could influence co-receptor interactions. The glycan attached to WNT8A at position Asn103 is in close proximity to an extensive hydrophilic surface of WLS, seemingly mediating the interaction between the two proteins in this region ( Figure 2 C). Mutation of Asn103 impaired the production and signaling activity of WNT8A, suggesting an important functional role of this glycan ( Figures 2 D and 2E).
Similar to Wnts in complex with the FZD CRD ( Hirai et al., 2019 27. Hirai, H. ∙ Matoba, K. ∙ Mihara, E. ... Crystal structure of a mammalian Wnt-frizzled complex Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2019; 26 :372-379 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar ; Janda et al., 2012 32. Janda, C.Y. ∙ Waghray, D. ∙ Levin, A.M. ... Structural basis of Wnt recognition by Frizzled Science. 2012; 337 :59-64 Crossref Scopus (647) PubMed Google Scholar ), the structure of WNT8A when in complex with WLS has a highly conserved core of five helices from which the three hairpin loops extend, and two of these loops, hairpins 2 and 3, assemble as β strands forming β sheets ( Figure 1 E; Figure S6 ). The interaction between WNT8A and WLS is extensive, consisting of 2,403 Å 2 of buried surface ( Figures 2 A and 2B; Figure S6 ), likely contributing to the tight binding between the two proteins ( Coombs et al., 2010 11. Coombs, G.S. ∙ Yu, J. ∙ Canning, C.A. ... WLS-dependent secretion of WNT3A requires Ser209 acylation and vacuolar acidification J.

Wnt hairpin 1, which in the Wnt-CRD structure interacts directly with hairpin 2, here instead is separated from hairpin 2 by the first β sheet of the WLS LD ( Figures 2 A and 2B). Hairpin 1 extends two conserved tryptophan residues, Trp127 and Trp129, to foster a number of contacts with highly conserved WLS residues, including Ser104, Phe107, Asn227, and Gly229 on the top of WLS TM helices 1 and 2 ( Figure 3 A).
Hairpin 2, stabilized by two disulfide bonds, carries the PAM at its tip, bound to the absolutely conserved Ser186. This hairpin inserts deep into the WLS TM domain and makes multiple contacts in a central hydrophobic cavity also lined by conserved residues ( Figure 3 B). The PAM, in turn, threads through a narrow hydrophobic tunnel between TM helices 4 and 5, facilitated by WLS Gly305 ( Figures 3 C and 3D). The WNT8A Ser186-PAM ester bond is coordinated primarily by an ionic interaction between WLS Asp301 and WLS Arg357 ( Figure 3 D). The density map does not clearly define the position of the distal carbons of the PAM, consistent with it being flexible in the lipid bilayer ( Figure S3 ). This suggests that WLS, similar to the FZD CRD and the recently observed palmitate binding site of the Drosophila glypican Dlp, might not be highly sensitive to acyl chain length ( McGough et al., 2020 46.

This observation is in contrast to the high specificity reported for PORCN and the Wnt deacylase NOTUM for 16:1 acyl groups ( Kakugawa et al., 2015 34. Kakugawa, S. ∙ Langton, P.F. ∙ Zebisch, M. ...

As a biochemical test of the model, we replaced WNT8A hairpin 1 contact points, including WLS residues Ser104, Phe107, and Asn227, with alanine or, in the case of Gly229, with glutamine. These changes significantly impaired the ability of Wnt to signal to β-catenin in a T cell factor (TCF)-Optimized Promoter-luciferase (TOPFlash) reporter assay ( Figure 3 E) ( Swiatek et al., 2006 68. Swiatek, W. ∙ Kang, H. ∙ Garcia, B.A. ... Negative regulation of LRP6 function by casein kinase I epsilon phosphorylation J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281 :12233-12241 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ). We next mutated WLS residues with a role in hairpin 2 binding. Loss of the WLS Asp301-Arg375 interaction that coordinates the serine-PAM bond completely abrogated Wnt signaling. Replacement of Gly305 in TM4, which interacts with PAM, with a bulky tryptophan residue (G305W) markedly decreased signaling as well ( Figure 3 E).
To better understand the nature of the impaired signaling activity, we assessed the ability of various WLS mutants to bind to and promote secretion of WNT8A ( Figures 3 F and 3G). Virtually all mutants of WLS that affected its interaction with Wnt hairpins 1 and 2 decreased Wnt secretion into the medium ( Figure 3 F). Mutants S104A and G229Q were expressed comparably with WT but had decreased Wnt binding and secretion. Several mutants (e.g., N227A) had decreased expression and decreased secretion. The decreased ability of these mutants to bind to WNT8A was also found in a co-immunoprecipitation assay ( Figure 3 G). These data indicate that there are multiple important interactions of WLS with Wnt hairpins 1 and 2 that are essential for retrieving newly synthesized, palmitoleated Wnts from the ER.
In the WNT8A-WLS structure, hairpin 3 forms an arch from the helical core to the upper extremity of the WLS LD ( Figures 1 E and 2 A), where it inserts Trp318 of the sequence Trp-Cys-Cys deep into a conserved, hydrophobic pocket ( Figures 2 B, 4 A, and 4C). Consistent with the conserved nature of the tip of Wnt hairpin 3 ( Figure 4 B; Figure S7 ), this binding pocket on WLS can likely accommodate a variety of Wnts. One notable change in Wnt hairpin 3 in moving from its interaction with WLS to the FZD CRD is the orientation of Phe316 and Trp318. The side chains of these residues shift markedly between the two structures ( Figure 4 C), suggesting that they might function as a molecular switch when Wnt changes binding partners.
Wnt hairpin 3, although essential for interaction with the FZD CRD, is apparently not required for Wnt secretion. Mutation of a number of conserved residues in this hairpin abrogates Wnt signaling activity without impairing Wnt secretion ( Kumar et al., 2014 37. Kumar, S. ∙ Žigman, M. ∙ Patel, T.R. ...

Non-acylated Wnts Can Promote Signaling Cell Reports. 2019; 26 875–883.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ). Similarly, Wnts lacking this hairpin can also be secreted ( Hoppler et al., 1996 29. Hoppler, S. ∙ Brown, J.D. ∙ Moon, R.T.

We confirmed that WNT8A with mutation of Trp318, Cys319, or Cys320 to alanine was able to be secreted but unable to signal ( Figures 4 D and 4E) ( MacDonald et al., 2014 44. MacDonald, B.T. ∙ Hien, A. ∙ Zhang, X. ... Disulfide bond requirements for active Wnt ligands J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289 :18122-18136 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (71) PubMed Google Scholar ). This suggests that the conserved WCC motif that interacts with the WLS LD is required not because it binds to WLS but because it allows Wnt hairpin 3 to transfer to and interact with the FZD CRD.
In the xWnt8-FZD CRD and the WNT3A-CRD structures, Wnt hairpin 3 is stabilized by three highly conserved disulfide bonds, including an unusual vicinal disulfide bond between Cys319 and Cys320 in the WCC motif ( Figures 4 A and 4C) ( Hirai et al., 2019 27. Hirai, H. ∙ Matoba, K. ∙ Mihara, E. ... Crystal structure of a mammalian Wnt-frizzled complex Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2019; 26 :372-379 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar ; Janda et al., 2012 32. Janda, C.Y. ∙ Waghray, D. ∙ Levin, A.M. ... Structural basis of Wnt recognition by Frizzled Science. 2012; 337 :59-64 Crossref Scopus (647) PubMed Google Scholar ). The densities at Cys319 and Cys320 do not allow a firm conclusion regarding whether they are oxidized or reduced ( Figures 4 A and 4C; Figure S3 ); in the deposited model (PDB: 7KC4 ), we present the oxidized form. The mutational studies noted above suggest that formation of the disulfide bond is not essential for palmitoleation and WLS interaction but necessary for WNT3A to bind to the FZD CRD ( MacDonald et al., 2014 44. MacDonald, B.T. ∙ Hien, A. ∙ Zhang, X. ... Disulfide bond requirements for active Wnt ligands J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289 :18122-18136 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (71) PubMed Google Scholar ). These data support the importance of Wnt hairpin 3 for association with the FZD CRD rather than for interaction with WLS.
A comparison of the two structures, WNT8A in complex with WLS and xWnt8 in complex with FZD, shows essentially no differences in the α helix core of the Wnts but substantial movements in the hairpin loops ( Figure 5 ). WNT8A hairpins 1 and 2 are moved apart by the WLS LD (amino acids [aa] 39–47). In the Wnt-CRD structure, these two hairpins are tightly associated and form a partial β sheet ( Figure 5 B). When bound to WLS, WNT8A hairpin 1 is displaced laterally by 22.6 Å, hairpin 3 shifts inward by 17.2 Å to contact the WLS hydrophobic pocket, and hairpin 2 with the attached PAM is moved by 15.4 Å, as measured from Ser186 in WNT8A, to insert the PAM into the TM domain of WLS ( Figure 5 C). These movements indicate substantial flexibility in the Wnt hairpins that might also contribute to their versatility in being able to bind to other Wnt-interacting proteins, such as PORCN, RYK, ROR1, GPC4, and PTK7 ( Niehrs, 2012 49. Niehrs, C. The complex world of WNT receptor signalling Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2012; 13 :767-779 Crossref Scopus (1125) PubMed Google Scholar ).
One of the most surprising findings in the structure of WLS is a large cavity buried deep in the WLS TM domain. This space is open to the luminal side at the top and to the lipid bilayer via a gap between TM helices 6 and 7, suggesting a potential avenue for palmitoleated Wnt hairpin 2 to enter and exit ( Figure 6 A). The density map also reveals the presence of additional species in this cavity, which we tentatively assigned to two POPG (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-3- sn -phosphatidyl glycerol) molecules, the lipids that were used for nanodisc reconstitution ( Figure 6 B). These ordered POPG molecules contact the conserved inner lining of the WLS binding pocket ( Figure 6 C). POPS (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl- sn -glycero-3-phospho-L-serine) was required for solubilization of active PORCN ( Lee et al., 2019 41. Lee, C.-J. ∙ Rana, M.S. ∙ Bae, C. ... In vitro reconstitution of Wnt acylation reveals structural determinants of substrate recognition by the acyltransferase human Porcupine J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294 :231-245 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting that common membrane components such as glycerol-phospholipids might play a role in stabilizing the interactions between protein and PAM or contribute to an energetically favorable environment as the PAM enters or exits the WLS central cavity.
Despite its original name of GPR177 and the evolutionary conservation of the multiple TM domains ( Figure S4 ) ( Gloriam et al., 2007 19. Gloriam, D.E. ∙ Fredriksson, R. ∙ Schiöth, H.B. The G protein-coupled receptor subset of the rat genome BMC Genomics. 2007; 8 :338 Crossref Scopus (176) PubMed Google Scholar ), the structural homology of WLS to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family has remained unclear. A search of the Protein Database with the WLS TM domain by using the DALI server ( Holm, 2020 28. Holm, L. DALI and the persistence of protein shape Protein Sci. 2020; 29 :128-140 Crossref Scopus (458) PubMed Google Scholar ) identified GPCRs, including Smoothened (PDB: 6D35 and 6O3C ) ( Deshpande et al., 2019 12.

Crystal structure of the Frizzled 4 receptor in a ligand-free state Nature. 2018; 560 :666-670 Crossref Scopus (73) PubMed Google Scholar ), and the glucagon receptor (PDB: 5YQZ ) ( Zhang et al., 2018a 85. Zhang, H. ∙ Qiao, A. ∙ Yang, L. ... Structure of the glucagon receptor in complex with a glucagon analogue Nature. 2018; 553 :106-110 Crossref Scopus (100) PubMed Google Scholar ) as proteins with the highest structural similarity. We aligned WLS TM helices 2–8 with the glucagon receptor and FZD 4 (RMSD for the Cα backbone of 1.0 and 1.1 Å, respectively), and confirmed that they indeed have very similar arrangements in the membrane ( Figures 6 D and 6E). WLS lacks the classic cytoplasmic helix 8 found in most GPCRs that is parallel to the membrane plane. The WLS central hydrophobic cavity where PAM and WNT8A hairpin 2 interact corresponds to the canonical GPCR ligand-binding site ( Figure 6 F). Although phospholipids are not generally observed in GPCR binding sites, ligands for GPCRs can be hydrophobic ( Audet and Stevens, 2019 4. Audet, M. ∙ Stevens, R.C. Emerging structural biology of lipid G protein-coupled receptors Protein Sci. 2019; 28 :292-304 Crossref Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ), and the structure of the γ-aminobutyric acid type B (GABA B ) receptor shows evidence of a bound ordered phosphatidylethanolamine ( Papasergi-Scott et al., 2020 52.

Park, J. ∙ Fu, Z. ∙ Frangaj, A. ... Structure of human GABAB receptor in an inactive state Nature. 2020; 84 :835-836 Google Scholar ). In other GPCRs, small drug-like molecules can insert into smaller versions of this cavity to regulate function ( Zhang et al., 2018b 87. Zhang, X. ∙ Dong, S. ∙ Xu, F. Structural and Druggability Landscape of Frizzled G Protein-Coupled Receptors Trends Biochem. Sci. 2018; 43 :1033-1046 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ). WLS might be able to similarly accommodate small molecules in this domain, making it a potential target for drugs that would inhibit secretion of all Wnts.

Section: Discussion

WLS is the link between Wnt synthesis and Wnt receptor engagement and is required to transport the large number (19 in human) of Wnts from their site of synthesis in the ER toward the variety of Wnt transporters and receptors on nearby cells. Using single-particle cryo-EM, we determined the structure of human palmitoleated WNT8A in complex with WLS. The structure reveals that WLS has an ancient and potentially druggable GPCR fold in its TM domain and an LD apparently related to an ancient lipid-binding fold. Wnt hairpin 2 bearing the O-linked PAM extends deep into a conserved hydrophobic cavity in the GPCR-like domain ( Figure 2 B) in a region that has been targeted by small molecules in other GPCRs ( Figure 6 F). There are extensive contacts between Wnt and WLS in the LD as well. The combination of these hydrophobic PAM-WLS-bilayer and charged Wnt hairpin 2-WLS interactions likely explains the previously observed tight binding between Wnts and WLS ( Coombs et al., 2010 11. Coombs, G.S. ∙ Yu, J. ∙ Canning, C.A. ... WLS-dependent secretion of WNT3A requires Ser209 acylation and vacuolar acidification J. Cell Sci. 2010; 123 :3357-3367 Crossref Scopus (158) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the contacts of Wnt hairpin 3 appear to be dispensable for binding to WLS but essential for interaction with the FZD CRD.
The structure of WNT8A-WLS suggests a model for how Wnts might be transferred in the ER from PORCN to WLS. The WLS central cavity has a large opening to the lipid bilayer between TM helices 6 and 7 ( Figure 6 A). This opening might be ideally suited to accommodate the lateral transfer in cis ; i.e., in the same membrane, of palmitoleated Wnt from PORCN ( Figure 7 ). Conserved residues on the surface of the TM domain of WLS near this opening ( Figures 2 B and 6 A; Figure S6 A) might serve as contact points for WLS to bind to PORCN to facilitate the transfer. This direct transfer model is consistent with previous findings that PORCN expression causes clustering of endogenous WLS in the ER ( Yu et al., 2014 84. Yu, J. ∙ Chia, J. ∙ Canning, C.A. ... WLS retrograde transport to the endoplasmic reticulum during Wnt secretion Dev. Cell. 2014; 29 :277-291 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (103) PubMed Google Scholar ). More speculatively, loading of palmitoleated Wnt onto WLS could also trigger a conformational change of the WLS TM domains that, in turn, might serve as a signal for the Wnt-WLS complex to exit the ER and travel to the plasma membrane.
The structure resolves the persistent question of how WLS handles the PAM moiety bound to Wnt. When Wnt covalent O-acylation was first identified, speculation centered on a membrane-tethering or lipoprotein-binding role of the fatty acid, similar to the role of the far more common S-palmitoylation in diverse proteins ( Panáková et al., 2005 51.

A number of PAM-binding proteins, including various MBOAT proteins and stearoyl CoA desaturase, also accommodate the acyl group in the plasma membrane ( Sui et al., 2020 66. Sui, X. ∙ Wang, K. ∙ Gluchowski, N.L. ...

Biol. 2015; 22 :581-585 Crossref Scopus (130) PubMed Google Scholar ). Conversely, the structure of xWnt8 in complex with the FZD CRD demonstrated that the PAM could instead be accommodated in a hydrophobic groove in the extracellular space ( Nile et al., 2017 50. Nile, A.H. ∙ Mukund, S. ∙ Stanger, K. ... Unsaturated fatty acyl recognition by Frizzled receptors mediates dimerization upon Wnt ligand binding Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :4147-4152 Crossref Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar ). More recently, the structures of NOTUM, a Wnt deacylase, and Dally-like protein (Dlp), a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored glypican that facilitates Wnt diffusion on cell surfaces, also demonstrated binding of PAM to domains in the extracellular space ( Kakugawa et al., 2015 34.

McGough, I.J. ∙ Vecchia, L. ∙ Bishop, B. ... Glypicans shield the Wnt lipid moiety to enable signalling at a distance Nature. 2020; 585 :85-90 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ). We had speculated previously that the WLS LD might harbor a PAM-binding site ( Coombs et al., 2010 11. Coombs, G.S. ∙ Yu, J. ∙ Canning, C.A. ... WLS-dependent secretion of WNT3A requires Ser209 acylation and vacuolar acidification J. Cell Sci. 2010; 123 :3357-3367 Crossref Scopus (158) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the WNT8A-WLS structure demonstrates that the PAM remains firmly anchored in the central cavity and adjacent lipid bilayer of the GPCR-like TM domain.
How Wnts are released at the plasma membrane remains controversial. The WNT8A-WLS structure provides some insight into mechanisms of Wnt secretion. The commonly accepted trans -transfer model proposes that Wnts are released from WLS at the surface of sending cells and undergo facilitated diffusion toward Wnt receiving cells via interaction with glypicans and/or lipid binding proteins ( Langton et al., 2016 40.

Stanganello, E. ∙ Scholpp, S. Role of cytonemes in Wnt transport J. Cell Sci. 2016; 129 :665-672 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar )( Figure 7 ). An alternative mechanism that might be operative in some settings is transfer of Wnt from WLS to FZD receptors in cis ; for example, after vesicular transport of a Wnt-WLS complex to a receiving cell. This model is consistent with data showing that (1) Wnts can signal in an autocrine manner, (2) Wnt and WLS can transfer together across synapses on lipid vesicles such as exosomes, and (3) WLS and Wnt are transferred together to the receiving cell membrane in the Drosophila brain ( Gross et al., 2012 23.

Trans-synaptic transmission of vesicular Wnt signals through Evi/Wntless Cell. 2009; 139 :393-404 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (363) PubMed Google Scholar ). Constraining both of these models is the fact that the PAM of Wnt is buried deep in the lipid bilayer when bound to WLS, contributing to a seemingly tight interaction. Our prior study indicated that vesicular acidification is required for Wnt transfer from WLS ( Coombs et al., 2010 11. Coombs, G.S. ∙ Yu, J. ∙ Canning, C.A. ... WLS-dependent secretion of WNT3A requires Ser209 acylation and vacuolar acidification J. Cell Sci. 2010; 123 :3357-3367 Crossref Scopus (158) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our structure shows a histidine in Wnt hairpin 2 (His183; Figure 3 D) whose protonation might affect the Wnt-WLS interaction. However, mutation of this histidine has been shown previously to block palmitoleation and, hence, WLS binding ( Lee et al., 2019 41. Lee, C.-J. ∙ Rana, M.S. ∙ Bae, C. ...

Chem. 2019; 294 :231-245 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ), hindering further analysis of its potential role in Wnt release. In either case, close interactions must be required to facilitate extraction of PAM from WLS and the lipid bilayer into, e.g., the FZD juxtamembrane CRD hydrophobic groove or the glypican PAM binding site. In the case of FZD and perhaps also glypicans, this might require or be triggered by transfer of Wnt hairpin 3 from WLS to the respective CRD.
An intriguing change that occurs when Wnt moves from WLS to the FZD CRD is the conformational change of the highly conserved hairpin 3 ( Figure 4 B), which has been proposed to be the major determinant of FZD binding affinity ( Janda et al., 2012 32. Janda, C.Y. ∙ Waghray, D. ∙ Levin, A.M. ... Structural basis of Wnt recognition by Frizzled Science. 2012; 337 :59-64 Crossref Scopus (647) PubMed Google Scholar ). In particular, the side chains of Phe316 and Trp318 undergo a marked pivot. In addition, when bound to the FZD CRD, Wnt hairpin 3 has a vicinal disulfide bond at its tip. Vicinal disulfide bonds are rare because they form a constrained eight-atom ring ( Carugo et al., 2003 10. Carugo, O. ∙ Cemazar, M. ∙ Zahariev, S. ... Vicinal disulfide turns Protein Eng. 2003; 16 :637-639 Crossref Scopus (103) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hunter et al., 2002 31. Hunter, H.N. ∙ Fulton, D.B. ∙ Ganz, T. ...

Chem. 2002; 277 :37597-37603 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (350) PubMed Google Scholar ; Luken et al., 2010 43. Luken, B.M. ∙ Winn, L.Y.N. ∙ Emsley, J. ... The importance of vicinal cysteines, C1669 and C1670, for von Willebrand factor A2 domain function Blood. 2010; 115 :4910-4913 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ). We confirmed the previous observation that mutation of either or both cysteines had no effect on Wnt secretion but abrogated Wnt signaling activity ( Figures 4 D and 4E) ( MacDonald et al., 2014 44. MacDonald, B.T. ∙ Hien, A. ∙ Zhang, X. ... Disulfide bond requirements for active Wnt ligands J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289 :18122-18136 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (71) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistent with these mutational data, our structure suggests that disulfide bond formation is not required for hairpin 3 to insert Trp318 of the WCC motif into its binding pocket on WLS. The side chains of Phe316 and Trp318 are clearly defined in the experimental density map, and these residues adopt the same conformation regardless of how we model the vicinal cysteines, for which the density is ambiguous ( Figure 4 C; Figure S3 ). We speculate that formation of the vicinal disulfide bond could be coupled to dissociation of Wnt from WLS in the oxidizing extracellular milieu, licensing Wnt to bind to the FZD CRD, a hypothesis that will require further study.
The structure of Wnt in complex with its obligate carrier protein WLS provides several insights into Wnt signaling. The multi-phylum conservation of the contact points between these two proteins suggests that WLS-mediated transport of lipid-modified Wnt is an ancient and essential step in the pathway and provides an explanation for why WLS can bind to all Wnts. The structure appears to settle the long-standing question of whether WLS is closely related to GPCRs, showing that WLS indeed has a GPCR-related fold in its TM domain. Unique to WLS is an LD that makes extensive contacts with the Wnt hairpins and an extensive central hydrophobic cavity in the GPCR-like TM domain, which is open to the membrane and harbors the PAM and ordered glycerol phospholipids, likely important for stabilization of the PAM. Insertion of the PAM into the lipid bilayer provides constraints for models of how Wnts are transferred from PORCN to WLS and then onto their receptors on nearby cells. Wnt hairpin 3 might serve as a conformational switch with implications for the localization and unidirectionality of the transfer of Wnt between WLS and the FZD CRD. The structure of the WNT8A-WLS complex establishes a framework to understand, at a molecular level, how this key developmental and homeostatic pathway establishes short-range signaling.

DH10Bac E. coli competent cells were used to generate recombinant baculovirus for heterologous protein expression.

HEK293 and RKO cells were cultured in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (HyClone), 1% penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen) and 1% sodium pyruvate (Lonza) at 37°C and 5% CO 2 .
To identify suitable candidates for structural studies, human WNT3A, 7A and 8A with a C-terminal StrepII-tag and human WLS isoform 1 with C-terminal GFP and 10x-histidine tags were cloned into pcDNA3.1 vector for transient transfection in mammalian cells. To scale up protein expression, Human WNT8A with a StrepII-tag, and human WLS isoform 1 with C-terminal 10x histidine and FLAG tag ( Figure S1 D) were both cloned into the pEG BacMam vector ( Goehring et al., 2014 21.

The PORCN inhibitor ETC-159 was formulated in DMSO and used at a final concentration of 100 nM as previously described ( Madan et al., 2016 45. Madan, B. ∙ Ke, Z. ∙ Harmston, N. ...

One day before transfection, RKO WLS null cells were seeded into 24-well plates. Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher) mixed with DNA in a ratio of 3:1 using the manufacturer’s protocol. For each well 100 ng STF reporter, 50 ng mCherry, 50 ng PGK-mWNT3A and indicated amount of WLS plasmid mix was used. After 48 h of transfection, cells were lysed with 100 μl of Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) for 20 min at 4°C with shaking. The cell lysates were transferred to a 96-well black plate and then an equal volume of luciferase assay reagent (Promega) was added. Luciferase activity was measured on a Tecan Infinite 2000 plate reader. mCherry values were used for normalization.
10 mL of HEK293 Freestyle suspension cells at 2 × 10 6 cells/ml were co-transfected by mixing 7.5 μg of WLS plasmid and 7.5 μg of respectively the 3 different isoforms of WNT3A, WNT7A and WNT8A diluted into 500 μl opti-MEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with 60 μg of polyethylenimine (PEI) Max MW 40,000 (Polysciences) diluted into 500 μl opti-MEM. Cells were incubated for 72 h at 37°C in 7% CO 2 and 70% humidity before harvesting at 800 × g for 20 min. Each pellet was resuspended and solubilized in 1 mL of a buffer containing 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), cOmplete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), 10 μg/ml DNase I (Roche), 8 μg/ml RNase (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1% n-dodecyl-β-D-maltopyranoside (DDM) with 0.1% cholesteryl hemisuccinate (CHS) at 4°C for 2 h with gentle agitation. Insoluble material was removed by ultracentrifugation for 45 min at 4°C in a single angle rotor at 100,000 × g in a TLA-120.2 rotor (Beckman Coulter). The supernatants were applied to 50 μl streptavidin resin (IBA) and incubated for 3 h at 4°C with gentle agitation in order to bind the strep-tagged Wnts. The resin was washed with 10 column volumes of a buffer containing 50 mM TRIS pH 8, 150mM NaCl, and 0.1% of DDM with 0.1% CHS. Elution was performed with 3 column volumes of the same buffer containing 50 mM biotin. The supernatant of each sample was subjected to fluorescence-coupled size exclusion chromatography (FSEC) analysis in a buffer containing 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 0.03% DDM with 0.003% CHS to evaluate both expression and stability of GFP-tagged WLS complex formation with Wnts.
Recombinant P1 baculovirus DNA was transfected into Sf9 cells (Expression System) in the presence of PEI and cultured in ESF 921 protein-free insect cell culture medium (Expression Systems). For protein expression, 75 mL WNT8A P4 virus and 25 mL WLS P4 virus were used to co-infect 1-l cultures of HEK293S GnTI − cells ( Reeves et al., 2002 56. Reeves, P.J. ∙ Callewaert, N. ∙ Contreras, R. ... Structure and function in rhodopsin: high-level expression of rhodopsin with restricted and homogeneous N-glycosylation by a tetracycline-inducible N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I-negative HEK293S stable mammalian cell line Proc.

GnTI − cells lack N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (GnTI) activity, and so express more homogenously glycosylated proteins ( Reeves et al., 2002 56. Reeves, P.J. ∙ Callewaert, N. ∙ Contreras, R. ...

Cells were incubated for 16 h at 37°C in 8% CO 2 and 70% humidity before addition of 5 mM sodium butyrate (Sigma-Aldrich) to increase protein expression. Cells were further incubated at 37°C for 48 h before harvesting. Cell pellets were homogenized using low-salt buffer (100 mM Tris pH 8, 10 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl 2 , 0.5 mM PMSF, cOmplete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail, 10 μg/ml DNaseI and 8 μg/ml RNase) in a Dounce homogenizer before ultracentrifugation at 134,000 × g in a type 45 Ti rotor (Beckman Coulter). Membrane fractions were further homogenized and washed using high-salt buffer (100 mM Tris pH 8, 500 mM NaCl, 10 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl 2 , 0.5 mM PMSF, cOmplete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail, 10 μg/ml DNase I and 8 μg/ml RNase) followed by ultracentrifugation. The washed membrane fractions were resuspended in storage buffer (100 mM Tris pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM PMSF, cOmplete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail, 10 μg/ml DNaseI and 8 μg/ml RNase) using a Dounce homogenizer and stored at −80°C until use. Thawed membrane fractions were solubilized using DDM with CHS at a 10:1 (w/w) ratio to make a final concentration of 1% (w/v) detergent and incubated at 4°C for 2 h with gentle agitation. Insoluble material was pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 134,000 × g in a type 45 Ti rotor (Beckman Coulter) for 30 min at 4°C. The supernatant was added to a 50 mL conical tube containing pre-equilibrated Ni 2+ -NTA resin (QIAGEN) in 20 mM imidazole and incubated at 4°C overnight with gentle agitation. Resin was washed with 10 column volumes of wash buffer (100 mM Tris pH 8, 200 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, 0.05% DDM and 0.005% CHS), and eluted with 3 column volumes of elution buffer (100 mM Tris pH 8, 200 mM NaCl, 200 mM imidazole, 0.05% DDM and 0.005% CHS). Eluted protein was de-salted using a PD10 de-salting column (Millipore Sigma) using a buffer consisting of 100 mM Tris pH 8, 200 mM NaCl, 0.05% DDM and 0.005% CHS. De-salted eluent was concentrated to 0.56 mg/ml using a 50 kDa filter (Amicon). The eluent was incubated with a 1:5:300 molar ratio of protein:membrane-scaffold protein 1E3D1 (MSP1E3D1):1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1′-rac-glycerol) (POPG) at 4°C for 2 h with gentle agitation to incorporate protein into nanodiscs. For reconstitution, detergent was removed from the mixture by incubating with Bio-beads (Bio-Rad) at 4°C overnight with rotation. After separation of reconstituted nanodiscs from Bio-beads, the mixture was bound to pre-equilibrated streptavidin resin (IBA) through overnight rotation at 4°C to remove empty nanodiscs and further purify the WNT8A/WLS complex. The streptavidin resin was washed with 10 column volumes of wash buffer (100 mM Tris pH 8, 150 mM NaCl) and nanodisc-protein complex was eluted using 3 column volumes of elution buffer (100 mM Tris pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM biotin). Eluent was de-salted using a PD10 de-salting column (Millipore Sigma) with an elution buffer (100 mM Tris pH 8, 150 mM NaCl).
The purified protein complex was concentrated to 1.0 mg/ml using a 50 kDa filter concentrator (Amicon). The sample was frozen using a Vitrobot (Thermo Fisher) by adding 3 ul of the purified protein complex to previously plasma cleaned (Gatan Solarus) 0.6/1-μm holey gold grid (Quantifoil UltrAuFoil). After a 30 s incubation at 4°C and > 95% humidity, the grids were blotted using 595 filter paper (Ted Pella, Inc) for 7.5 s and immediately plunged into liquid ethane for vitrification. Images were recorded using a Titan Krios electron microscope (FEI), at the Columbia University Cryo-Electron Microscopy center, equipped with an energy filter and a K3 direct electron detection filter camera (Gatan K3-BioQuantum) using a 0.83Å pixel size.
An energy filter slit width of 20 eV was used during the collection and was aligned automatically every hour using the Leginon software package ( Suloway et al., 2005 67. Suloway, C. ∙ Pulokas, J. ∙ Fellmann, D. ... Automated molecular microscopy: the new Leginon system J. Struct. Biol. 2005; 151 :41-60 Crossref Scopus (1231) PubMed Google Scholar ). Data collection was performed using a dose of around 58 e − Å −2 across 50 frames (50 ms per frame) at a dose rate of approximately 16 e − per pixel per s, using a set nominal defocus range of −1 μm to −2 μm. A 100-μm objective aperture was used. We collected a total of 12,747 micrographs over a 2.5 day session. The ice thickness, measured in Leginon using a coefficient calculated based on the zero loss peak, was determined to be 26.7 ± 16.1 nm (mean ± s.d).
Movie frames were aligned using Patch Motion Correction implemented in cryoSPARC v.2.15 ( Punjani et al., 2017 55. Punjani, A. ∙ Rubinstein, J.L. ∙ Fleet, D.J. ... cryoSPARC: algorithms for rapid unsupervised cryo-EM structure determination Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :290-296 Crossref Scopus (4029) PubMed Google Scholar ) using a B-factor during alignment of 500. Contrast transfer function (CTF) estimations were done using Patch CTF implemented in cryoSPARC v.2.15 ( Punjani et al., 2017 55. Punjani, A. ∙ Rubinstein, J.L. ∙ Fleet, D.J. ... cryoSPARC: algorithms for rapid unsupervised cryo-EM structure determination Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :290-296 Crossref Scopus (4029) PubMed Google Scholar ). The micrographs were sorted based on CTF fit resolution, ice thickness and astigmatism and 3,642 micrographs were removed, resulting in 9,105 micrographs. Template picker in cryoSPARC v.2.15 was used to pick 4,415,933 particles, using templates from previous rounds of data processing derived from manually picked particles and filtered to 20 Å. The particles were extracted using a 320-pixel size box and binned four times and were then classified using 2D classification in cryoSPARC v.2.15 using a batchsize per class of 400 and “Force Max over poses/shifts” turned off with 40 online-EM iterations. 2D classes corresponding to intact particles with evident secondary structure were selected, resulting in a set of 188,472 particles after multiple rounds of 2D classification. Ab initio reconstruction was performed in cryoSPARC v.2.15 using three classes and a class similarity parameter of 0.1. Only one of the three classes, comprising 80,268 particles, displayed features consistent with a nanodisc-embedded membrane protein. These particles were re-extracted using a 320-pixel box size without binning. Heterogenous refinement using four starting models was done sequentially five times using the three previously obtained ab initio models plus a fourth class using an ab initio model generated from previously discarded particles. Non-uniform refinement of the final particle stack of 27,288 particles in cryoSPARC yielded a reconstruction with a resolution of 3.61 Å (FSC = 0.143). The particles were re-extracted using a 450-pixel size box and subjected to a new non-uniform refinement, followed by a local non-uniform refinement using a mask around WLS and WNT8A excluding the nanodisc, resulting in a final 3.19 Å density map (See Figure S2 ). Density modification was performed on unfiltered half maps using phenix.resolve_cryo_em ( Terwilliger et al., 2020 70. Terwilliger, T.C. ∙ Ludtke, S.J. ∙ Read, R.J. ... Improvement of cryo-EM maps by density modification Nat. Methods. 2020; 17 :923-927 Crossref Scopus (171) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To build the WNT8A-WLS model we first made threaded a homology model of WNT8A based on the xWnt8 structure (PDB: 4F0A ) using CHAINSAW ( Stein, 2008 64. Stein, N. CHAINSAW: a program for mutating pdb files used as templates in molecular replacement J. Appl. Cryst. 2008; 41 :641-643 Crossref Scopus (476) Google Scholar ). The model was fitted to the map as a rigid body in Chimera ( Pettersen et al., 2004 54. Pettersen, E.F. ∙ Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ... UCSF Chimera--a visualization system for exploratory research and analysis J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25 :1605-1612 Crossref Scopus (33445) PubMed Google Scholar ) and transferred to Coot ( Emsley et al., 2010 15. Emsley, P. ∙ Lohkamp, B. ∙ Scott, W.G. ... Features and development of Coot Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :486-501 Crossref Scopus (20200) PubMed Google Scholar ; Emsley and Cowtan, 2004 13. Emsley, P. ∙ Cowtan, K. Coot: model-building tools for molecular graphics Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60 :2126-2132 Crossref Scopus (25409) PubMed Google Scholar ) for manual model building. A blurred map was used for some regions of WNT8A (i.e., residue 241-247, 288-310, 328-337) as this map was easier to interpret in these regions, and a blurred map (B = 100) has been deposited to EMDB. We observed extra density that could not be accounted for by the protein extending out from two residues N103 and N262, and we were able to fit NAG and mannose moieties into this density consistent with predicted glycosylation sites ( Emsley and Crispin, 2018 14. Emsley, P. ∙ Crispin, M. Structural analysis of glycoproteins: building N-linked glycans with Coot Acta Crystallogr. D Struct. Biol. 2018; 74 :256-263 Crossref Scopus (69) PubMed Google Scholar ). The palmitoleate (PAM) is attached to Ser186, as predicted, and the lipid chain was modeled into the density. WLS was modeled de novo in Coot using secondary structure predictions from the XtalPred server ( Slabinski et al., 2007 60. Slabinski, L. ∙ Jaroszewski, L. ∙ Rychlewski, L. ... XtalPred: a web server for prediction of protein crystallizability Bioinformatics. 2007; 23 :3403-3405 Crossref Scopus (243) PubMed Google Scholar ) as a guide. Subsequent model refinement and adjustment was performed in Coot and Phenix ( Adams et al., 2010 1. Adams, P.D. ∙ Afonine, P.V. ∙ Bunkóczi, G. ... PHENIX: a comprehensive Python-based system for macromolecular structure solution Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :213-221 Crossref Scopus (18485) PubMed Google Scholar ; Afonine et al., 2018 2. Afonine, P.V. ∙ Poon, B.K. ∙ Read, R.J. ... Real-space refinement in PHENIX for cryo-EM and crystallography Acta Crystallogr. D Struct. Biol. 2018; 74 :531-544 Crossref Scopus (1516) PubMed Google Scholar ) iteratively.
A cavity search using the Solvent Extractor from Voss Volume Voxelator server ( Voss and Gerstein, 2010 74. Voss, N.R. ∙ Gerstein, M. 3V: cavity, channel and cleft volume calculator and extractor Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38 :W555-62 Crossref Scopus (391) PubMed Google Scholar ) was performed using an outer-probe radius of 15 Angstrom and inner-probe radius of 2 Angstrom. We used the DALI server to search for other structures with a similar fold both using only the transmembrane domain as well as using the WLS-LD only ( Holm, 2020 28. Holm, L. DALI and the persistence of protein shape Protein Sci. 2020; 29 :128-140 Crossref Scopus (458) PubMed Google Scholar ). Chimera ( Pettersen et al., 2004 54. Pettersen, E.F. ∙ Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ... UCSF Chimera--a visualization system for exploratory research and analysis J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25 :1605-1612 Crossref Scopus (33445) PubMed Google Scholar ) and ChimeraX ( Goddard et al., 2018 20. Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ∙ Meng, E.C. ... UCSF ChimeraX: Meeting modern challenges in visualization and analysis Protein Sci. 2018; 27 :14-25 Crossref Scopus (2591) PubMed Google Scholar ) were used to visualize the structures in the figures.
Membrane impermeable Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (Thermo Scientific) was freshly dissolved in PBS/Ca 2 + /Mg 2 + to 1 mg/ml before use. Transfected HEK293 cells were rinsed twice with PBS before adding the biotin solution on ice. The cells were incubated at 4°C for 1 h, followed by washing once with PBS/Ca2 + /Mg2 + . The reaction was quenched by incubating with 100 mM glycine at 4°C for 15 min. After washing, the cells were lysed on the dish with HEPES lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 0.6% NP-40 and protease inhibitor cocktail) for subsequent streptavidin pull down.
Transfected HEK293 cells were lysed with HEPES lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 0.6% NP-40 and protease inhibitor cocktail) on ice. After removal of cell debris, 500 μg of total protein lysates were used for each immunoprecipitation with 1 μg of anti-V5 antibody (BioRad). After incubation in the cold room overnight with tumbling, 40 μl of Protein A/G plus agarose (Santa Cruz) was added into each tube and incubated for another 2 h in the cold room. The agarose beads were then pelleted and washed three times with HEPES lysis buffer and bound proteins were eluted in SDS-PAGE sample buffer.
For calculations of Fourier shell correlations (FSC), the FSC cut-off criterion of 0.143 ( Rosenthal and Henderson, 2003 58. Rosenthal, P.B. ∙ Henderson, R. Optimal determination of particle orientation, absolute hand, and contrast loss in single-particle electron cryomicroscopy J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 333 :721-745 Crossref Scopus (1610) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. The experiments were not randomized. The investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment. For cell-based assays, statistics were calculated using GraphPad Prism 8.
