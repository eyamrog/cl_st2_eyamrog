Title: Human gut mycobiota tune immunity via CARD9-dependent induction of anti-fungal IgG antibodies


Abstract: Summary

Antibodies mediate natural and vaccine-induced immunity against viral and bacterial pathogens, whereas fungi represent a widespread kingdom of pathogenic species for which neither vaccine nor neutralizing antibody therapies are clinically available. Here, using a multi-kingdom antibody profiling (multiKAP) approach, we explore the human antibody repertoires against gut commensal fungi (mycobiota). We identify species preferentially targeted by systemic antibodies in humans, with Candida albicans being the major inducer of antifungal immunoglobulin G (IgG). Fungal colonization of the gut induces germinal center (GC)-dependent B cell expansion in extraintestinal lymphoid tissues and generates systemic antibodies that confer protection against disseminated C. albicans or C. auris infection. Antifungal IgG production depends on the innate immunity regulator CARD9 and CARD9 + CX3CR1 + macrophages. In individuals with invasive candidiasis, loss-of-function mutations in CARD9 are associated with impaired antifungal IgG responses. These results reveal an important role of gut commensal fungi in shaping the human antibody repertoire through CARD9-dependent induction of host-protective antifungal IgG.

Advances in modern medicine, such as immunosuppressive therapy, chemotherapy, and organ transplantation, have contributed to a massive increase in deadly fungal infections affecting millions of people worldwide ( Brown et al., 2012 5.

These infections are often caused by systemic translocation of Candida species from the gut ( Fan et al., 2015 21. Fan, D. ∙ Coughlin, L.A. ∙ Neubauer, M.M. ...

The combination of a limited number of antifungal drugs and global emergence of multidrug-resistant Candida species renders these infections highly lethal, with mortality rates as high as 50% ( Brown et al., 2012 5.

Most antibacterial and antiviral vaccines available today are rooted in boosting antibody-mediated immunity ( Plotkin, 2010 56. Plotkin, S.A. Correlates of protection induced by vaccination Clin.

Notably, systemic immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies with broad specificity for intestinal bacteria are an important component of host protection against systemic bacterial infections of intestinal origin ( Ansaldo et al., 2019 1.

However, antibodies against fungal β-glucan and other fungal antigens have been detected recently in serum of healthy humans ( Chiani et al., 2009 10. Chiani, P. ∙ Bromuro, C. ∙ Cassone, A. ...

Serum Antibody Profile during Colonization of the Mouse Gut by Candida albicans: Relevance for Protection during Systemic Infection J. Proteome Res. 2017; 16 :335-345 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ), raising several important questions regarding the function of antifungal antibodies, the species that induce them, and the mechanisms governing their induction and regulation. We hypothesized that fungal species of the gut mycobiota play a critical role in shaping the host antibody repertoire by promoting induction of host-protective antifungal antibodies.

Section: Results

To explore the antibody pool against gut mycobiota, we established a multistep flow cytometry-based technique for multi-kingdom antibody profiling (multiKAP) ( Figure 1 A) that uses the native reservoir of gut commensal fungi and bacteria in fecal material as potential epitopes for antibody binding. Serum from the same host is applied to the fecal sample to allow systemic antibody binding to intestinal microbes that are also already bound to the luminally secreted antibodies present in the feces ( Figure 1 A). Live microbes labeled with a DNA-binding dye (Sybr Green; Sybr hi ) in mouse feces are distinguished from dead microbes (Sybr lo ) in sterilized food and bedding by calibrating the assay against germ-free (GF) mouse feces ( Figure 1 B). In contrast to previously established microbial flow cytometry-based techniques ( Ansaldo et al., 2019 1. Ansaldo, E. ∙ Slayden, L.C. ∙ Ching, K.L. ...

Immunoglobulin A coating identifies colitogenic bacteria in inflammatory bowel disease Cell. 2014; 158 :1000-1010 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (909) PubMed Google Scholar ), multiKAP distinguishes fungi from the more abundant bacteria by their large cell size and the distinct presence of chitin in their cell walls ( Figures 1 B–1D). Size separation by centrifugation at 900 × g , followed by sorting of antibody-bound fungal and bacterial cells and isolation of their DNA for downstream deep sequencing/analysis allows assignment of fungal identities, in addition to bacterial identities, in the same multiKAP assay ( Figures 1 D and 1E).
Co-staining of fecal microbes with Sybr and calcofluor-white (CFW; a chitin-binding dye) followed by flow cytometry analysis determined that 1%–2% of the microbes in mouse feces were fungal cells (Sybr hi CFW + ; Figures 1 C and S1 A). To determine whether the gut mycobiota are coated by antibodies of local secretory and/or systemic origin, we next analyzed the IgA- and IgG-bound fungal (Sybr hi CFW + ) and bacterial (Sybr hi CFW − ) populations before and after fecal incubation with serum from the same mouse. Consistent with previously reported luminal IgA reactivity to intestinal bacteria in mice ( Bunker et al., 2015 6. Bunker, J.J. ∙ Flynn, T.M. ∙ Koval, J.C. ...

Immunoglobulin A coating identifies colitogenic bacteria in inflammatory bowel disease Cell. 2014; 158 :1000-1010 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (909) PubMed Google Scholar ), roughly half of the intestinal fungi identified by multiKAP were also bound by IgA independent of serum supplementation ( Figures 1 F and 1G), suggesting that systemic antibodies make a small contribution to the antifungal IgA repertoire in mice. Notably, a population of intestinal fungi were bound by IgG found exclusively in the blood ( Figures 1 F, 1G, and S1 A; +wild-type [WT] serum) because no IgG-bound fraction of the mycobiota was present in the intestinal lumen under steady-state conditions ( Figures 1 F, 1G, and S1 A; −serum). A similar binding pattern was observed when feces from Ig-deficient Rag2 −/− mice were used as a gut fungal source to avoid prior IgA epitope coating ( Figure S1 B). Antifungal IgG binding was absent upon incubation with serum from B cell-deficient μMT −/− mice, which lack systemic antibodies, confirming the specificity of this assay ( Figures 1 F, 1G, and S1 A; + μMT −/− serum). We also detected systemic antifungal IgM antibodies restricted to the blood ( Figures 1 F and 1G), supporting previous reports of involvement of the natural antifungal IgM repertoire in early immune responses during Pneumocystis or Cryptococcus infection ( McClelland et al., 2010 49. McClelland, E.E. ∙ Nicola, A.M. ∙ Prados-Rosales, R. ... Ab binding alters gene expression in Cryptococcus neoformans and directly modulates fungal metabolism J. Clin. Invest. 2010; 120 :1355-1361 Crossref Scopus (91) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rapaka et al., 2010 57. Rapaka, R.R. ∙ Ricks, D.M. ∙ Alcorn, J.F. ... Conserved natural IgM antibodies mediate innate and adaptive immunity against the opportunistic fungus Pneumocystis murina J. Exp. Med. 2010; 207 :2907-2919 Crossref Scopus (103) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although antifungal IgM binding was similar upon incubation of specific pathogen-free (SPF) feces with GF and SPF serum, antifungal IgG binding was absent in GF serum-incubated SPF feces ( Figures 1 H–1K), indicating that induction of antifungal IgG, but not antifungal IgM, is gut microbiota dependent. Mice from different facilities that harbor compositionally different mycobiota ( Doron et al., 2019 15. Doron, I. ∙ Leonardi, I. ∙ Iliev, I.D. Profound mycobiome differences between segregated mouse colonies do not influence Th17 responses to a newly introduced gut fungal commensal Fungal Genet. Biol. 2019; 127 :45-49 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ) exhibit a variety of IgG binding, with our facility’s specially housed mouse colony ( Doron et al., 2019 15. Doron, I. ∙ Leonardi, I. ∙ Iliev, I.D. Profound mycobiome differences between segregated mouse colonies do not influence Th17 responses to a newly introduced gut fungal commensal Fungal Genet. Biol. 2019; 127 :45-49 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ) and Taconic mice showing significantly higher antifungal IgG than mice from The Jackson Laboratory facility ( Figure 1 L). This phenomenon was independent of any detectable fungal pathology in the examined colonies or systemic fungal spread ( Figures S1 F and S1G). Given these findings and the negligible contribution of serum IgA to the antifungal IgA repertoire ( Figures 1 F and 1G), we focused on analyzing the gut microbiota-dependent systemic antifungal IgG response. Previous studies have observed that the IgG2b and IgG3 subtypes dominate the IgG response to commensal gut bacteria, with the IgG2b isotype binding the largest fraction of the bacteria ( Koch et al., 2016 33. Koch, M.A. ∙ Reiner, G.L. ∙ Lugo, K.A. ... Maternal IgG and IgA Antibodies Dampen Mucosal T Helper Cell Responses in Early Life Cell. 2016; 165 :827-841 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (214) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although we observed a similar abundance of these two IgG isotypes ( Figures S1 C and S1D; Koch et al., 2016 33. Koch, M.A. ∙ Reiner, G.L. ∙ Lugo, K.A. ... Maternal IgG and IgA Antibodies Dampen Mucosal T Helper Cell Responses in Early Life Cell. 2016; 165 :827-841 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (214) PubMed Google Scholar ), IgG3 bound the largest fraction of the intestinal fungi ( Figures 1 M and 1N).
Fungi and bacteria cohabitate in the human intestine, where we found that fungal constituents of the microbiota are more prevalent (∼2%) than initially predicted by metagenomics studies ( Arumugam et al., 2011 2. Arumugam, M. ∙ Raes, J. ∙ Pelletier, E. ..., MetaHIT Consortium Enterotypes of the human gut microbiome Nature. 2011; 473 :174-180 Crossref Scopus (5332) PubMed Google Scholar ; Li et al., 2019 42.

Gut Mycobiota in Immunity and Inflammatory Disease Immunity. 2019; 50 :1365-1379 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (151) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figures 2 A, 2B, and S1 E). An initial multiKAP-based assessment of healthy human subjects determined that, despite substantial inter-individual variation, a large fraction of human intestinal fungi is bound by luminal IgA independent of serum addition ( Figure 2 C). Similar to mice, mycobiota-reactive IgG antibodies in healthy individuals were restricted to the serum ( Figure 2 C). MultiKAP assessment of these human subjects revealed that, along with a large proportion of all gut fungi bound to IgG and IgA (IgG + IgA + , ∼50%) or neither antibody isotype (IgG − IgA − , ∼25%), a significant population of fungi was only bound by IgG (IgG + IgA − , ∼20%) ( Figure 2 D). These data demonstrate that a significant fraction of the gut mycobiota is recognized by systemic antifungal IgG antibodies in humans and mice. Furthermore, systemic mycobiota-reactive IgG antibodies are typically present in the serum of mice and healthy individuals, whereas antifungal IgA antibodies are mostly present in the gut.
To determine specific gut fungi that are preferentially coated or neglected by systemic human IgG antibodies, we coupled the multiKAP technique to ITS sequencing of gut fungal populations that were sorted from fecal material based on antibody binding ( Figures 2 D, S2 A, and S2B). ITS sequencing revealed a variety of commensal, environmental, and food-associated fungi ( Figure 2 E), consistent with previous studies ( Nash et al., 2017 52.

Fungal microbiota dysbiosis in IBD Gut. 2017; 66 :1039-1048 Crossref Scopus (885) PubMed Google Scholar ). As noted above, we distinguished three populations of intestinal fungi (IgG + IgA + , IgG + IgA − , and IgG − IgA − ) by multiKAP, where all luminal IgA-bound fungi were also recognized by systemic IgG. Among these, the IgG-bound mycobiota (IgG + IgA + and IgG + IgA − ) were enriched for C. albicans (as determined by the positive coating index [CI]) ( Kau et al., 2015 30. Kau, A.L. ∙ Planer, J.D. ∙ Liu, J. ... Functional characterization of IgA-targeted bacterial taxa from undernourished Malawian children that produce diet-dependent enteropathy Sci. Transl. Med. 2015; 7 :276ra24 Crossref Scopus (267) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure S2 C), whereas gut fungi not bound by either antibody pool (IgG − IgA − ) were represented by skin- and food-associated fungal species such as M. restricta and S. cerevisiae , which rarely cause gut-disseminated infections in humans ( Brown et al., 2012 5. Brown, G.D. ∙ Denning, D.W. ∙ Gow, N.A.R. ... Hidden killers: human fungal infections Sci. Transl. Med. 2012; 4 :165rv13 Crossref Scopus (3144) PubMed Google Scholar ; Fan et al., 2015 21.

High-resolution mycobiota analysis reveals dynamic intestinal translocation preceding invasive candidiasis Nat. Med. 2020; 26 :59-64 Crossref Scopus (181) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figures 2 F–2H and S2 D). Other fungi detected by this approach were distributed equally in antibody-bound and unbound fractions and, thus, were not considered to be preferentially coated by antifungal antibodies ( Figures 2 F, 2G, and S2 D). These data indicate that the systemic antifungal IgG antibody repertoire in healthy individuals is primarily characterized by preferential specificity to commensal Candida .
Candida is one of the most common genera of fungal commensals in the healthy human gastrointestinal tract ( Li et al., 2019 42. Li, X.V. ∙ Leonardi, I. ∙ Iliev, I.D.

Among other fungi, C. albicans has been implicated as a potent inducer of Th17 responses in humans and mice; it is bound by host antibodies and, thus, has the potential to induce protective immune responses or trigger inflammation in a context-dependent manner ( Bacher et al., 2019 3.

Although most studies of intestinal C. albicans have focused exclusively on innate and Th17-mediated immunity, humoral immunity to this commensal in the gut remains poorly understood. Given our finding that systemic antibodies preferentially coat gut C. albicans , we sought to characterize how systemic antibody responses to this intestinal fungus are mediated.
IgG antibody responses to intestinal microbes can originate by antigen-specific responses to a distinct organism or can be derived from pre-existing cross-reactive specificities ( Ansaldo et al., 2019 1.

Innate and adaptive immunity cooperate flexibly to maintain host-microbiota mutualism Science. 2009; 325 :617-620 Crossref Scopus (418) PubMed Google Scholar ). To investigate these possibilities and identify gut fungi that induce systemic antifungal IgG responses, we performed fungal monocolonization of GF mice that lacked antibody responses to fungi before colonization ( Figures 2 I, 1 H, and 1I). Among fungal species identified by multiKAP, C. albicans induced the most potent systemic IgG antibody response ( Figure 2 I). Notably, antibodies generated by intestinal colonization with C. albicans were not cross-reactive with environmental, food-derived, or skin-resident fungi such as Saccharomyces , Aspergillus , and Malassezia spp. ( Figure 2 J), suggesting a potential specificity restricted to resident fungal antigens. These data further indicate that intestinal fungal colonization can induce systemic antifungal IgG antibodies that are not derived from pre-existing cross-reactive specificities and implicate C. albicans as the predominant intestinal fungal species triggering this response.
A better understanding of fungus-specific antibody induction is obscured by coexistence of fungi with a dynamic bacterial community whose composition profoundly influences colonization of, and immune responses induced by, newly introduced bacterial or fungal commensals ( Fan et al., 2015 21.

To avoid the influence of these confounding factors in our investigation into the mechanisms of antifungal antibody induction, we utilized altered Schaedler flora (ASF)-colonized mice that carry a defined set of bacteria but are mycobiota-free ( Li et al., 2018 41. Li, X. ∙ Leonardi, I. ∙ Semon, A. ...

In this setting, intestinal colonization with C. albicans (preferentially coated by systemic IgG antibodies) induced strong production of systemic antifungal IgG antibodies without priming unspecific antibacterial IgG response, whereas S. cerevisiae (preferentially not coated by systemic IgG antibodies) induced a limited IgG response ( Figures 3 A and S3 A). These findings further support the notion that specific gut fungi might play a dominant role in induction of systemic antifungal IgG antibodies.
IgG responses to intestinal bacteria have been attributed to gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) ( Ansaldo et al., 2019 1. Ansaldo, E. ∙ Slayden, L.C. ∙ Ching, K.L. ...

Gut Microbiota-Induced Immunoglobulin G Controls Systemic Infection by Symbiotic Bacteria and Pathogens Immunity. 2016; 44 :647-658 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (276) PubMed Google Scholar ). To determine sites of B cell expansion and IgG class switch recombination (CSR) upon intestinal fungal colonization, gut-distal tissue (spleen) and GALT (mesenteric lymph nodes [mLNs] and Peyer’s patches [PPs]) were obtained from fungus-colonized ( C. albicans -colonized [+ Ca ] and S. cerevisiae -colonized [+ Sc ]) and fungus-free ASF (ASF) mice. Notably, C. albicans gut colonization induced a robust IgG CSR in the spleen but not in PPs or mLNs ( Figure 3 C). On the other hand, S. cerevisiae induced a limited CSR response at these sites ( Figure 3 C), consistent with its low capacity to induce systemic IgG antibodies ( Figure 3 A). These results were not attributable to any noticeable systemic fungal spread or acute reaction ( Macpherson et al., 2000 47. Macpherson, A.J. ∙ Gatto, D. ∙ Sainsbury, E. ... A primitive T cell-independent mechanism of intestinal mucosal IgA responses to commensal bacteria Science. 2000; 288 :2222-2226 Crossref Scopus (907) PubMed Google Scholar ) to C. albicans colonization because no live fungi were detectable in multiple organs, whereas anti- C. albicans IgG antibodies appeared at 2 weeks and persisted after the initial colonization event ( Figures S3 D and S3E). Generation of high-specificity IgG is often driven by expansion of germinal center B (GC-B) cells ( Barbet et al., 2018 4. Barbet, G. ∙ Sander, L.E. ∙ Geswell, M. ...

Gut Microbiota Drive Autoimmune Arthritis by Promoting Differentiation and Migration of Peyer’s Patch T Follicular Helper Cells Immunity. 2016; 44 :875-888 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (212) PubMed Google Scholar ), which undergo many cycles of somatic hypermutation (SHM) that are associated with high-affinity and high titers of antibodies ( Victora and Nussenzweig, 2012 74. Victora, G.D. ∙ Nussenzweig, M.C. Germinal centers Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2012; 30 :429-457 Crossref Scopus (1512) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistent with its ability to drive CSR, gut C. albicans induced potent splenic GC-B cell expansion and differentiation accompanied by transfer of C. albicans antigens (as assessed by sensitive DNA-based assay) to the spleen ( Figures 3 B and 3D). No significant differences were detected in the frequency of total splenic B cells between experimental groups ( Figures S3 3B and S3C). Notably, adoptive transfer of antibody-producing splenic B cells from + Ca mice, but not antibody-deficient B cells or B cells from GF mice, protected highly susceptible μMT −/− mice against systemic candidiasis, suggesting a protective role of B cell-mediated immunity against fungal infection ( Figures 4 A, 4B, S4 A, and S4B). These data suggest that the gut commensal C. albicans induces systemic IgG production through expansion of GC-B cells in the spleen.
To determine the functional role of systemic antifungal IgG, we purified IgG antibodies from serum of GF mice, which normally lack systemic anti-commensal IgG antibodies in the absence of fungal or bacterial antigen exposure ( Figures 1 H and 1I), intestinally monocolonized with C. albicans ( C.alb -IgG) or S. cerevisiae ( S.cer -IgG) ( Figure 4 C). Antifungal antibodies obtained from C. albicans ex-GF mice have strong reactivity with C. albicans , whereas IgG antibodies from serum of S. cerevisiae -monocolonized mice demonstrate weaker reactivity with S. cerevisiae ( Figures 4 C and 2 J).
We next explored the role of these antibodies during immunosuppression, where, among different fungi, Candida species are the main cause of morbidity and mortality in people, with the gut often being the fungus source ( Brown et al., 2012 5. Brown, G.D. ∙ Denning, D.W. ∙ Gow, N.A.R. ... Hidden killers: human fungal infections Sci. Transl. Med. 2012; 4 :165rv13 Crossref Scopus (3144) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhai et al., 2020 79. Zhai, B. ∙ Ola, M. ∙ Rolling, T. ... High-resolution mycobiota analysis reveals dynamic intestinal translocation preceding invasive candidiasis Nat. Med. 2020; 26 :59-64 Crossref Scopus (181) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, C.alb -IgG or S.cer -IgG antibodies were transferred into SPF mice intestinally colonized with C. albicans and treated with the chemotherapy drug cyclophosphamide (Cyc) to induce immunosuppression and facilitate gut-to-system fungal dissemination and death ( Figure S4 B; Koh et al., 2008 34. Koh, A.Y. ∙ Köhler, J.R. ∙ Coggshall, K.T. ... Mucosal damage and neutropenia are required for Candida albicans dissemination PLoS Pathog. 2008; 4 :e35 Crossref Scopus (291) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition to severe leukopenia ( Koh et al., 2008 34. Koh, A.Y. ∙ Köhler, J.R. ∙ Coggshall, K.T. ... Mucosal damage and neutropenia are required for Candida albicans dissemination PLoS Pathog. 2008; 4 :e35 Crossref Scopus (291) PubMed Google Scholar ), Cyc treatment led to a dramatic decrease in antifungal IgG antibodies in the serum of mice ( Figure S4 C). Notably, C.alb -IgG transfer into these mice led to nearly complete survival 4 weeks after systemic fungal dissemination and significantly decreased kidney fungal burdens ( Figures 4 D and 4E), whereas S.cer -IgG transfer did not reduce infection mortality ( Figures 4 F and 4G). Candida auris is an emerging multidrug-resistant fungal pathogen that is a serious global health threat and is the cause of multiple nosocomial outbreaks worldwide that are associated with unusually high mortality rates ( Eyre et al., 2018 19. Eyre, D.W. ∙ Sheppard, A.E. ∙ Madder, H. ... A Candida auris Outbreak and Its Control in an Intensive Care Setting N. Engl. J. Med. 2018; 379 :1322-1331 Crossref Scopus (331) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, we used our GF colonization protocol to generate antibodies against this multidrug-resistant fungal pathogen and test their efficacy. Notably, such generated antibodies ( C.aur- IgG) protected mice against intravenous C. auris infection and death. C.alb -IgG antibody transfer was also protective but to a lower extent (diminishing only brain-disseminated candidiasis), suggesting some level of cross-protection among fungi belonging to the same genus ( Figures 4 H–4J). These results demonstrate that systemic antibodies to mycobiota generated through the gastrointestinal route protect the host against deadly systemic fungal infections of intestinal or non-intestinal origin. Moreover, this protection demonstrates the powerful effect of antifungal antibody immunity in the face of broad cellular immunity depression by chemotherapeutics.
Among genetic factors associated with fungal infections, caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 9 (CARD9) deficiency is the only known human genetic disorder that specifically leads to recurrent severe mucosal and systemic fungal infections without conferring bacterial, parasitic, or viral susceptibility ( Cao et al., 2015 7.

Mendelian genetics of human susceptibility to fungal infection Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Med. 2014; 4 :a019638 Crossref Scopus (76) PubMed Google Scholar ). CARD9 is required to activate nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)-based signaling downstream of the receptors Dectin-1, Dectin-2, and Mincle in innate immune cells, which, in turn, induces cytokine production and triggers cellular immunity against fungi ( Cao et al., 2015 7.

A common polymorphism in CARD9 is among the strongest genetic risk factors associated with Crohn’s disease, where increased anti- S. cerevisiae IgG antibodies (ASCA IgG) are a clinical marker of disease severity ( Evans et al., 2011 18.

Genet. 2011; 43 :1066-1073 Crossref Scopus (626) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, CARD9 deficiency has been associated with gut fungal dysbiosis ( Lamas et al., 2016 36. Lamas, B. ∙ Richard, M.L. ∙ Leducq, V. ... CARD9 impacts colitis by altering gut microbiota metabolism of tryptophan into aryl hydrocarbon receptor ligands Nat. Med. 2016; 22 :598-605 Crossref Scopus (998) PubMed Google Scholar ), revealing CARD9 signaling as a critical link between gut mucosal immunity and intestinal fungi. Interestingly, Card9 -deficient ( Card9 −/− ) mice that were highly susceptible to systemic candidiasis originating from the gut upon Cyc treatment were unable to induce systemic antifungal IgG antibodies despite a high systemic Candida burden ( Figures 5 A–5C) and normal development of T and B cell subsets ( Hsu et al., 2007 27. Hsu, Y.-M.S. ∙ Zhang, Y. ∙ You, Y. ... The adaptor protein CARD9 is required for innate immune responses to intracellular pathogens Nat. Immunol. 2007; 8 :198-205 Crossref Scopus (357) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figures S4 H and S4I). In contrast, Card9 -sufficient ( Card9 +/+ ) mice that were more resistant to fungal infection with intestinal origin were able to generate systemic IgG antibodies against C. albicans ( Figures 5 A–5C). MultiKAP analysis of antifungal IgG antibodies demonstrated that the presence of a systemic antifungal IgG repertoire was strikingly dependent on the presence of CARD9 signaling ( Figures 5 D and 5E). These results suggest an unexpected role of CARD9 in induction of systemic antifungal IgG responses to intestinal fungi.
To investigate the mechanisms behind the observed CARD9-mediated antifungal IgG response, we intraperitoneally delivered heat-killed C. albicans to circumvent the extreme susceptibility of Card9 −/− mice to systemic candidiasis ( Drummond et al., 2015 16. Drummond, R.A. ∙ Collar, A.L. ∙ Swamydas, M. ... CARD9-Dependent Neutrophil Recruitment Protects against Fungal Invasion of the Central Nervous System PLoS Pathog. 2015; 11 :e1005293 Crossref Scopus (168) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lionakis et al., 2014 45. Lionakis, M.S. ∙ Netea, M.G. ∙ Holland, S.M. Mendelian genetics of human susceptibility to fungal infection Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Med. 2014; 4 :a019638 Crossref Scopus (76) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figures 5 F–5K, S4 D, and S4E). We found that IgG + B cell frequency among circulating B cells in the blood only increased significantly in response to C. albicans in Card9 +/+ mice ( Figures 5 F and 5G). In contrast to Card9 +/+ mice, Card9 −/− mice were unable to induce an efficient anti- C. albicans IgG antibody response, and this corresponded with defective IgG + CSR and GC-B cell expansion in the spleen ( Figures 5 H–5K) but was not due to B cell-intrinsic or developmental defects in the absence of CARD9 ( Figures S4 F and S4G). These data indicate that the GC-dependent systemic antifungal IgG antibody response is dependent on CARD9.
Single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of a previously published dataset ( Smillie et al., 2019 66. Smillie, C.S. ∙ Biton, M. ∙ Ordovas-Montanes, J. ... Intra- and Inter-cellular Rewiring of the Human Colon during Ulcerative Colitis Cell. 2019; 178 :714-730.e22 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (666) PubMed Google Scholar ) confirmed that CARD9 expression in humans is restricted to several populations of phagocytes, such as macrophages, monocytes, and dendritic cells (DCs; Figure 6 A). In mice, these populations include CD103 + conventional DCs (CD11b − cDC1s and CD11b + cDC2s) and CX3CR1 + mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs), cells described previously as providing an interface between the gut microbiota and anti-commensal immunoglobulin induction ( Flores-Langarica et al., 2018 23.

Toll-like receptor 3 in nasal CD103 + dendritic cells is involved in immunoglobulin A production Mucosal Immunol. 2018; 11 :82-96 Crossref Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because CX3CR1 + MNPs and the cDC2 subset represent the vast majority of C-type lectin receptor (CLR)/CARD9-expressing antigen-presenting cells, and a loss-of-function mutation in CX3CR1 is associated with reduced antifungal IgG antibodies in humans ( Leonardi et al., 2018 39. Leonardi, I. ∙ Li, X. ∙ Semon, A. ... CX3CR1 + mononuclear phagocytes control immunity to intestinal fungi Science. 2018; 359 :232-236 Crossref Scopus (213) PubMed Google Scholar ), we next set out to identify the potential involvement of CX3CR1 + MNPs and cDC2 in induction of IgG with specificity for intestinal fungi. We crossed transgenic Cd11c-Cre mice with inducible floxed CX3CR1 ( Cx3cr1 DTR ) or cDC2 master regulator interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4 fl/fl ) mice to generate models of inducible CX3CR1 + MNPs (ΔCX3CR1) and cDC2 (ΔIRF4) depletion, respectively ( Figures S5 A–S5D). MultiKAP analysis of serum IgG binding revealed that, relative to their respective Cre − littermates, CX3CR1 + MNPs, but not cDC2 depletion, abrogated the systemic antifungal IgG ( Figures 6 B and 6D). Intestinal colonization with C. albicans led to a reduction in IgG + frequency in the splenic B cell compartment of ΔCX3CR1 but not ΔIRF4 mice or littermate controls ( Figures 6 C and 6E). To assess whether Syk-Card9-mediated antifungal signaling on CX3CR1 + MNPs is necessary for induction of antifungal humoral responses, we crossed transgenic Cx3cr1-cre/ERT2 +/− mice with a strain carrying an inducible floxed spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk; Syk fl/fl ) to conditionally block Syk-dependent, Card9-mediated antifungal signaling in CX3CR1 + MNPs (CX3CR1 ΔSyk mice). We found that CX3CR1 + MNP-specific targeting of this pathway significantly reduced systemic antifungal IgG in CX3CR1 ΔSyk mice ( Figure 6 F). Furthermore, the increased frequency of splenic IgG + B cells observed in C. albicans -colonized littermates was not observed in CX3CR1 ΔSyk mice ( Figure 6 G). Notably, a comparison of antifungal IgG binding in αβT cell-deficient TCRβ −/− mice demonstrated significant loss of antifungal IgG binding relative to αβT cell-sufficient counterparts ( TCRβ +/+ ), suggesting that CX3CR1 + MNPs mediate antifungal IgG induction through T cell-dependent mechanisms ( Figure 6 H). These data pinpoint CX3CR1 + MNPs as mediators of commensal fungus-induced systemic antifungal IgG.
Having established the necessity of Syk-Card9 signaling for induction of antifungal antibodies in mice, we next explored whether a similar role of this pathway is conserved in humans. So far, over 22 different human homolog CARD9 mutations have been identified that abrogate the Th17 response without affecting total representation of T or B cells ( Corvilain et al., 2018 13. Corvilain, E. ∙ Casanova, J.-L. ∙ Puel, A. Inherited CARD9 Deficiency: Invasive Disease Caused by Ascomycete Fungi in Previously Healthy Children and Adults J. Clin. Immunol. 2018; 38 :656-693 Crossref Scopus (129) PubMed Google Scholar ), but whether these mutations affect systemic antifungal antibody induction remains unclear. We collected serum from individuals with systemic candidiasis representing non-carriers or carriers of CARD9 mutations (Q289 ∗ , R35Q, R70W; Figure 6 I) that have been associated previously with Candida -induced meningoencephalitis or colitis ( Figure S5 E; Lanternier et al., 2015 37. Lanternier, F. ∙ Mahdaviani, S.A. ∙ Barbati, E. ... Inherited CARD9 deficiency in otherwise healthy children and adults with Candida species-induced meningoencephalitis, colitis, or both J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2015; 135 :1558-1568.e2 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (170) PubMed Google Scholar ). Individuals with systemic candidiasis mounted a robust antibody response to C. albicans ( Figures 6 I and 6J). In contrast, carriers of mutant CARD9 alleles produced significantly lower titers of anti- C. albicans IgG antibodies ( Figures 6 I and 6J). These data implicate CARD9 as a critical mediator of systemic antifungal IgG antibody responses to the gut commensal C. albicans during health and during invasive fungal disease.

Our findings outline a model where these gut fungal species play a key role in induction and therapeutic efficacy of host-protective IgG antibodies. The gut mycobiota elicit GC-dependent IgG + B cell expansion through CARD9 signaling in CX3CR1 + macrophages to produce antifungal IgG that is protective against systemic fungal infection. Although we did not detect systemic fungal spread, intestinal colonization with C. albicans , but not with S. cerevisiae , induced a strong IgG CSR in the spleen. CSR was accompanied by transfer of C. albicans cell constituents (as assessed by a sensitive DNA-based assay) to this gut-distal organ and was abrogated upon depletion of CX3CR1 + MNPs. Furthermore, a previous study has reported that systemic antibodies to specific fungal antigens can arise in mice upon intestinal C. albicans colonization ( Huertas et al., 2017 28. Huertas, B. ∙ Prieto, D. ∙ Pitarch, A. ... Serum Antibody Profile during Colonization of the Mouse Gut by Candida albicans: Relevance for Protection during Systemic Infection J. Proteome Res. 2017; 16 :335-345 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ). These findings suggest that low-grade physiological fungal dissemination, reported previously for other commensals ( Macpherson et al., 2000 47. Macpherson, A.J. ∙ Gatto, D. ∙ Sainsbury, E. ... A primitive T cell-independent mechanism of intestinal mucosal IgA responses to commensal bacteria Science. 2000; 288 :2222-2226 Crossref Scopus (907) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zeng et al., 2016 78.

Gut Microbiota-Induced Immunoglobulin G Controls Systemic Infection by Symbiotic Bacteria and Pathogens Immunity. 2016; 44 :647-658 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (276) PubMed Google Scholar ), or gut-distal transport of fungal antigens and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by migratory phagocytes might play a role in distal induction of systemic antifungal antibodies to specific fungal commensals. In humans, we found that loss-of-function mutations in CARD9 that predispose individuals to severe fungal infections are associated with loss of antifungal antibody responses. Immunosuppression, the most common cause of systemic fungal infection in humans ( Brown et al., 2012 5. Brown, G.D. ∙ Denning, D.W. ∙ Gow, N.A.R. ... Hidden killers: human fungal infections Sci. Transl. Med. 2012; 4 :165rv13 Crossref Scopus (3144) PubMed Google Scholar ; Koh et al., 2008 34. Koh, A.Y. ∙ Köhler, J.R. ∙ Coggshall, K.T. ...

Zhai, B. ∙ Ola, M. ∙ Rolling, T. ... High-resolution mycobiota analysis reveals dynamic intestinal translocation preceding invasive candidiasis Nat. Med. 2020; 26 :59-64 Crossref Scopus (181) PubMed Google Scholar ), led to a dramatic decrease in antifungal IgG antibodies in serum of mice associated with rapid gut-to-systemic C. albicans translocation and death, whereas supplementation of systemic antifungal IgG against intestinal C. albicans was protective. Furthermore, antifungal IgG induced through gastrointestinal colonization was protective against systemic infection with C. auris , an emerging multidrug-resistant fungal pathogen for which limited therapies are currently available. Thus, systemic IgG antibodies to the gut mycobiota appear to confer protective antifungal immunity and some degree of cross-specificity (to similar ligands expressed by different fungal species or to cross-reactive ligands) that may be protective against more than one fungal pathogen. Because fungi comprise a widespread kingdom of deadly pathogens for which only a handful of therapies (several antifungal drugs) are clinically available ( Fisher et al., 2012 22. Fisher, M.C. ∙ Henk, D.A. ∙ Briggs, C.J. ...

Garcia-Solache, M.A. ∙ Casadevall, A. Global warming will bring new fungal diseases for mammals MBio. 2010; 1 e00061–10 Crossref Scopus (235) PubMed Google Scholar ), the pathways activated in the host by the gut mycobiota outlined in our study may warrant further exploration for development of new approaches to antifungal vaccine or neutralizing antibody generation. Furthermore, the human native antifungal antibody pool can be explored for therapeutic purposes in susceptible immunosuppressed individuals, individuals with cancer, and organ transplant recipients or as a potential source of defense against emerging fungal threats.

7-8-week-old wild-type (WT) C57BL/6J, Ighm tm1Cgn /J (μMT −/− ), Cd11c-cre, Irf4 fl/fl , Cx3cr 1tm (DTR)Litt/J (Cx3cr1 DTR ), Syk fl/fl , Cx3cr1 tm2.1(cre/ERT2)Jung/J (Cx3cr1-cre/ERT2 +/+ ), Tcrb tm1Mom /J, Rag2tm1.1Cgn/J mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). Card9 −/− mice were kindly provided by Dr. Xin Lin (Department of Molecular and Cellular Oncology, University of Texas, Houston, TX, USA). The Cx3cr1 DTR mice were subsequently bred with hemizygous Cd11c-cre +/− mice to allow for selective depletion of CD11c + CD11b + CX3CR1 + MNPs upon administration of diphtheria toxin (DT). For depletion, such generated mice (Cd11c-cre +/− Cx3cr1 DTR mice) and their respective littermate controls (Cd11c-cre −/− Cx3cr1 DTR ) were injected for three consecutive days with 100ng of DT i.p followed by maintenance injection every other day for the length of the experiments. Depleted mice were designated as ΔCX3CR1 mice. Irf4 fl/fl mice were bred to hemizygous Cd11c-cre +/− mice to allow for genetic ablation of CD11c + CD11b + CD103 + dendritic cells (designated as ΔIrf4 mice) and the generation of littermate controls. Syk fl/fl mice were bred to Cx3cr1-cre/ERT2 +/+ to allow for the selective depletion of Syk in CX3CR1 expressing cells upon administration of tamoxifen. Cre-ERT recombinase in Cx3cr1-cre/ERT2 +/− mice was induced through injection with tamoxifen (TAM, Sigma) that was dissolved in sunflower oil (Sigma) to a final concentration of 10 mg/ml, and 100μl/mouse were injected i.p. every second day. Control littermates received 100 μl sunflower oil i.p every second day. Littermates were randomly assigned to experimental groups. Animals were used between 8 and 16 weeks of age. Males and females were used in approximately equal ratios. Mice were housed under specific pathogen-free (SPF) conditions unless otherwise described at Weill Cornell Medicine and experiments were performed after prior approval by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Weill Cornell Medicine.
Germ-free (GF) C57BL/6 mouse colonies were maintained within sterile vinyl isolators at Weill Cornell Medicine’s gnotobiotic mouse facility. Altered Schaedler Flora (ASF) mice were generated by colonizing GF mice with the defined ASF community ( Schaedler et al., 1965 63. Schaedler, R.W. ∙ Dubos, R. ∙ Costello, R. The development of the bacterial flora in the gastrointestinal tract of mice J. Exp. Med. 1965; 122 :59-66 Crossref Scopus (194) PubMed Google Scholar ) and allowing 5 generations of breeding before use.
Plasma and peripheral blood samples from patients with history of proven invasive candidiasis were collected following informed consent and IRB approval, in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration ( Corvilain et al., 2018 13. Corvilain, E. ∙ Casanova, J.-L. ∙ Puel, A. Inherited CARD9 Deficiency: Invasive Disease Caused by Ascomycete Fungi in Previously Healthy Children and Adults J. Clin. Immunol. 2018; 38 :656-693 Crossref Scopus (129) PubMed Google Scholar ). DNA samples from human peripheral blood were used for CARD9 genotyping as previously described ( Corvilain et al., 2018 13. Corvilain, E. ∙ Casanova, J.-L. ∙ Puel, A. Inherited CARD9 Deficiency: Invasive Disease Caused by Ascomycete Fungi in Previously Healthy Children and Adults J. Clin. Immunol. 2018; 38 :656-693 Crossref Scopus (129) PubMed Google Scholar ). Fecal and corresponding serum samples were obtained from healthy de-identified individuals following Institutional-Review-Board-approved protocols from the JRI IBD Live Cell Bank Consortium at Weill Cornell Medicine. Plasma samples from homozygous carriers of either wild-type (n = 5 ) or loss of function (n = 4 ) CARD9 alleles were processed for serological evaluation performed by ELISA as described below.
Fungal strains were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Candida albicans SC5314 (ATCC® MYA-2876) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ATCC® MYA-796) were cultured in aerobic conditions on Sabouraud Dextrose Broth (SDB; EMD Chemicals) at 37°C overnight, while Cladosporium cladosporioides (ATCC® 38810) and C. auris (CDC0389) were cultured in SD agar at 30°C for 5–7 days and 24 h, respectively. Malassezia restricta (ATCC® MYA-4611) was plated on Dixon agar (HiMedia Laboratories) coated with 2–3 mL of olive oil and grown at 30°C for 3-5 days.
For multiKAP, fecal pellets of 7-8 weeks old mice or human feces were collected. For multiKAP analysis across multiple facilities, samples were collected from age-matched mouse colonies born in our facility (WCM-CE) or from mice raised in Taconic Biosciences (TAC) or The Jackson Laboratory (JAX) 48–72 h after arriving in our facility. Samples were diluted to 25mg feces/mL in PBS, thoroughly homogenized, and filtered through a 35 μm strainer-capped tube (Falcon, 50mL). Resulting fecal slurries were incubated for 90 min at 30°C with serum from the same mouse or the same human subject diluted at 1:20 (mouse serum) or 1:100 (human serum) in blocking buffer (1% bovine serum albumin (BSA, MP Biomedicals)/0.05% sodium azide (Sigma)). After 30-minutes of blocking with staining buffer (2% BSA/0.05% sodium azide), mouse samples were stained with 1:500 mIgA-PE (Thermofisher) and/or 1:200 mIgG-AF647 (Jackson Immunoresearch) antibodies for 45 min at 4°C. Human samples were stained with 1:200 hIgA-PE (Miltenyi) and/or 1:400 hIgG-AF647 (Southern) antibodies. Stained pellets were further fixed in 4% formalin, followed by staining with 1:1000 SYBR-Green (Invitrogen)/1:500 calcofluor white (Sigma), and total fungal and bacterial content was analyzed by flow cytometry. Size separation was achieved by centrifugation at 900 x g for 10 min. The resulting large (fungal) and small (bacterial) IgA- and/or IgG-stained fractions were used for downstream applications such as flow cytometry analysis and/or sorting and/or DNA isolation. In a variation of the method, size separation was performed as a first step followed by serum incubation and antibody staining as above. For IgG isotype multiKAP assays, samples were stained with mIgG1-FITC (Thermofisher), mIgG2b-FITC (Thermofisher), or mIgG3-FITC (BD PharMingen). To avoid spectral overlap between FITC and Sybr-Green dye when FITC-labeled antibodies were used, DNA staining was performed with propidium iodide (PI; Thermofisher) or DAPI (Thermofisher) as an alternative DNA-binding dyes.
Antibody bound (IgG + IgA + , IgG + IgA - , IgG - IgA + ) and unbound (IgG - IgA - ) fungal and bacterial fractions were sorted on FACSAria III (BD Bioscience) with a 100 μm flow cell and processed for DNA isolation and microbiota qPCR and sequencing (see Table S1 for primers).
Sorted antibody-bound and unbound fecal fungal and bacterial fractions, or input feces were treated with lyticase (bacterial fractions were left untreated), followed by DNA isolation using QIAGEN’s QIAmp DNA mini kit as in Doron et al. (2019) 15. Doron, I. ∙ Leonardi, I. ∙ Iliev, I.D. Profound mycobiome differences between segregated mouse colonies do not influence Th17 responses to a newly introduced gut fungal commensal Fungal Genet. Biol. 2019; 127 :45-49 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar . Fungal and bacterial DNA was quantified in each sample by RT-PCR using fungal 18S and bacterial 16S rDNA-specific primers ( Table S1 ) as in Leonardi et al. (2018) 39.

Fungal ITS1-2 regions in rDNA isolated from sorted antibody-bound or unbound fecal fractions were amplified by PCR using the following primers: ITS1F CTTGGTCATTTAGAGGAAGTAA; ITS2R GCTGCGTTCTTCATCGATGC. Primers were modified to include forward (5′ TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAG-[locus-specific sequence]) and reverse (5′ GTCTCGTGGGCTCGGAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAG-[locus-specific sequence]) sequencing adaptors ( Table S1 ). ITS1-2 amplicons were generated with 35 cycles using Invitrogen AccuPrime PCR reagents (Carlsbad, CA). In a second PCR reaction, amplicons from each sample were uniquely indexed using Illumina Nextera XT v2 barcoded primers (San Diego, CA), ( Tang et al., 2015 71. Tang, J. ∙ Iliev, I.D. ∙ Brown, J. ... Mycobiome: Approaches to analysis of intestinal fungi J. Immunol. Methods. 2015; 421 :112-121 Crossref Scopus (125) PubMed Google Scholar ). Quality control of all libraries were conducted by qPCR, DNA 1000 Bioanalyzer (Agilent), and Qubit (Life Technologies) to validate and quantify library construction prior to preparing a paired end flow cell. Clonal bridge amplification (Illumina) was performed using a cBot (Illumina). 2 × 250 bp sequencing-by-synthesis was performed on Illumina MiSeq platform (Illumina).
Raw FASTQ ITS1 sequencing data were enriched for high quality reads by removing both the adaptor sequence by cutadapt v1.4.1 or any reads that lacked the proximal primer sequence. Sequence reads were then quality-trimmed by truncating reads below an average quality score of 20 over a 3 base pair (bp) sliding window and removing reads shorter than 100bp. These enriched high-quality reads were aligned to the Targeted Host Fungi (THF) ITS1 database ( Tang et al., 2015 71. Tang, J. ∙ Iliev, I.D. ∙ Brown, J. ... Mycobiome: Approaches to analysis of intestinal fungi J. Immunol. Methods. 2015; 421 :112-121 Crossref Scopus (125) PubMed Google Scholar ) using BLAST v2.2.22 and the pick_otus.py pipeline in the QIIME v1.9.1 wrapper with an identity percentage ≥ 97% for OTU picking. The alignment results were tabulated across all reads using the accession identifier of the ITS reference sequences as surrogate OTUs and using a Perl script. ITS sequencing data are available at NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) under the Genebank: PRJNA630985.
Fungal lysates were prepared by fixing pure fungal cultures in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA, diluted in PBS) for 60 min. Fungal suspensions were then washed 3 times by pelleting at 900 x g for 2 min, aspirating the supernatant, and resuspending the pellet in molecular-grade water. Fungi were treated with a cycle of 3 x (10 min on dry ice, 10 minutes 75°C). Finally, fungal suspensions were sonicated for 8 cycles of 15sec on/30sec off. Fungal debris was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 2 minutes, after which lysate-containing supernatant was used for ELISA plate coating.
Antifungal antibody titers in serum were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Fungal lysates were coated on a 96-well high-binding polystyrene plates (Corning) after diluting 1:50 in 50mM carbonate-bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.5). Saccharomyces cerevisiae mannan (Sigma) or bacterial flagellin from S. typhimurium (Invivogen) were coated at 5 μg/well and 0.1 μg/well in carbonate-bicarbonate buffer, respectively. Plates for total IgG measurement were coated with anti-mouse-IgG-IgA-IgM (Sigma) or anti-human Ig (Southern) diluted 1:2000 in coating buffer. Mouse serum was then applied to plates diluted at 1:20 and 1:250 in BSA for antigen-specific and total IgG assays, respectively. Human serum was applied at dilutions of 1:4000 and 1:10000 for antigen-specific and total IgG assays, respectively. Total IgG titers were measured against serial dilution standards of mouse (Bethyl Laboratories) and human (Southern) unconjugated IgG antibodies. Plates were developed using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-human IgG as previously described ( Leonardi et al., 2018 39. Leonardi, I. ∙ Li, X. ∙ Semon, A. ... CX3CR1 + mononuclear phagocytes control immunity to intestinal fungi Science. 2018; 359 :232-236 Crossref Scopus (213) PubMed Google Scholar ). Plates were read at OD 405 nm on a microtiter plate reader (Menlo Park, CA).
GF mice were orally gavaged with PBS or with 1x10 8 C. albicans , S. cerevisiae , M. restricta or with C. cladosporioides . ASF mice were orally gavaged with either PBS (ASF control) or with 1x10 8 C. albicans or S. cerevisiae yeast cells. Alternatively, cefoperazone (0.4 mg/ml; Sigma) was provided to SPF mice ad libitum in drinking water for the length of the colonization experiments followed by 1x10 8 C. albicans or S. cerevisiae yeast cells colonization via oral gavage. Mice were sacrificed at the described time points for blood, feces, and organ collection. B cell and T cell compartments were assessed by flow cytometry. Total, fungi-specific or flagellin-specific IgG antibody responses in serum collected at the beginning, during, and at the end of the experiment were assessed by ELISA or used in mutiKAP assays.
Four to six PP were excised from the ileum of each mouse and placed into Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) medium (Thermofisher), supplemented with 2 mM EDTA, and were shaken for 10 min at 37°C, followed washing and by mincing with scissors in a medium consisting of RPMI 1640 (Thermofisher), 5% FBS, 100 IU/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Thermofisher) and filtered through a nylon mesh (70μm). Spleens and mLNs were processed similarly and mesh-filtered, after which spleens were each treated with 1 mL of 1x RBC lysis buffer (Biolegend) for 2 min. Processed tissues were once again filtered through mesh, washed twice in PBS, and resuspended in cold PBS supplemented with 2% BSA for antibody staining.
Blood samples were prepared for lymphocyte isolation by transferring 50μL of blood into 1.7mL Eppendorf tubes containing 5μL citrate dextrose solution (ACD; Sigma) and mixed by pipetting to prevent coagulation. Blood samples are then treated with 200μL of 1 x RBC lysis buffer for 5 min, washed, and resuspended in cold PBS supplemented with 2% BSA for antibody staining.
Cell suspensions prepared as described above were blocked with CD16/CD32 (Mouse BD Fc Block, 2.4G2, BD Biosciences). For B cell compartment analysis, suspensions were stained with antibodies against CD45 (30-F11, Tonbo), CD4 (GK1.5, eBioscience), CD19 (6D5, Biolegend), IgD (11-26c.2a, Biolegend), IgG (polyclonal, Jackson ImmunoResearch), IgM (II/41, Thermofisher), CD95 (DX2, Biolegend), and GL7 antigen (GL7, Biolegend). Dead cells were excluded with eBioscience Fixable Viability Dye eFluor 455UV (Thermofisher). In phagocyte depletion experiments, suspensions were stained with antibodies against CD45 (30-F11, Tonbo), I-A/I-E a (M5/114.15.2, Biolegend), CD11c (N418, Biolegend), CD11b (M1/70, Thermofisher), CX3CR1 (SA011F11, Biolegend), and CD103 (2E7, Thermofisher). Dead cells were excluded with eBioscience Fixable Viability Dye eFluor 506 (Thermofisher). Bacterial FISH staining was performed with Cy5-labeled EUB338 5`-GCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT-3` probe (Integrated DNA Technologies; Table S1 ). Images were acquired under an inverted Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope (Nikon). Flow cytometry was performed using a LSRFortessa (BD Biosciences) and data were analyzed with FlowJo software (TreeStar).
Pure cultures of C. albicans grown in SDB at 37°C were washed in PBS, resuspended at 5x10 5 yeast cells/mL PBS, and were injected at days 0 and 14 in the tail vein of 5-7 weeks old WT and μMT −/− mice (1x10 5 yeast cells/mouse). In rescue experiments splenic B cells from 8-week-old GF mice, C. albicans -monocolonized ex-GF or Aicda −/− mice were purified by MACS negative sorting (Miltenyi), and adoptively transferred (2x10 7 B cells/mouse) into recipient μMT −/− mice two days (day −2) before systemic infection with C. albicans. Pure cultures of C. auris grown in SDB at 30°C were washed in PBS, resuspended at 5x10 8 yeast cells/mL PBS, and were injected at days 0 and 14 in the tail vein of 5-7 weeks old WT (1x10 8 yeast cells/mouse). At day 1 and 10 mice received i.p. injection of 400μg C.aur- IgG, C.alb -IgG, or sterile PBS. Disease progression was tracked for 28 days in all experimental groups. Moribund mice were sacrificed for serum, kidney, and brain tissue collection.
μMT −/− mice were treated for five days with 0.5 mg/ml fluconazole (Sigma), 1 mg/ml Penicillin G (Sigma), and 2 mg/ml streptomycin sulfate (Research Products International) ad libitum in the drinking water. Fluconazole was withdrawn and mice were orally gavaged with 1x10 8 C. albicans cells. Splenic B cells from 8-week-old CARD9 +/+ or CARD9 −/− mice were purified by MACS negative sorting (Miltenyi), and adoptively transferred (2x10 7 B cells/mouse) into recipient μMT −/− mice one day after the intestinal colonization with C. albicans. Serum was collected weekly; mice were sacrificed at 4 weeks for intestinal tissue and spleen collection.
GF were weaned after 4 weeks and orally gavaged with 1x10 8 C. albicans, C. auris or S. cerevisiae cells cultured from pure isolates overnight at 37°C. Between ages of 8-12 weeks, blood was collected every 3 days from each respective group and pooled. After 1 h of room temperature incubation to allow for coagulation the blood was centrifuged for 10 min at 6000 x g. The top layer of serum was transferred to a separate Eppendorf tube and stored at −20°C until purification. IgG was purified from pooled serum using the Protein G UltraLink TM Columns (Pierce). Purified IgG samples were desalted through buffer exchange to PBS using Amicon® Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter tubes (Millipore). After measuring the IgG concentration and assessing specificity, pure IgG suspensions ( C.alb -IgG, C.aur -IgG or S.cer -IgG) were adjusted with cold sterile PBS to 4 mg/mL and stored at −20°C until use. Pure IgG suspensions were delivered intraperitoneally for a single dose of 400μg IgG.
Mice were treated for five days with 0.5 mg/ml fluconazole (Sigma), 1 mg/ml Penicillin G (Sigma), and 2 mg/ml streptomycin sulfate (Research Products International) ad libitum in the drinking water. Fluconazole was withdrawn and mice were orally gavaged with 1x10 8 C. albicans cells three times spaced across five days, followed by i.p. injection of 400μg C.alb- IgG, S.cer -IgG, or sterile PBS ( Figure S4 B). Immunosuppression and systemic fungal dissemination were induced by i.p. injections of 150mg/kg mouse weight of cyclophosphamide (Cyc; R&D Systems) on days 0, 2, and 4, followed by a second series of injections on days 14, 16, and 18. Weight was measured, and moribund mice were sacrificed for serum, liver, and kidney tissue collection.
To assess the expression of CARD9 among immune cells in humans we mined a published single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset obtained from colon biopsies from healthy individuals in ( Smillie et al., 2019 66. Smillie, C.S. ∙ Biton, M. ∙ Ordovas-Montanes, J. ... Intra- and Inter-cellular Rewiring of the Human Colon during Ulcerative Colitis Cell. 2019; 178 :714-730.e22 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (666) PubMed Google Scholar ). Plots were created using the published differentially expressed genes for cell subsets, lineages, or sub-clusters in healthy tissue, relative to all other cells. These sequencing data are accessible under the Single Cell Portal ( https://singlecell.broadinstitute.org/single_cell ): SCP259.
Statistics were computed using GraphPad Prism version 8 (GraphPad Software) using the Mann-Whitney test (which does not assume normal distribution) for two groups. One-way ANOVA with Tukey’s or Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn`s for multiple comparisons was used for three or more groups. Statistical details specific to experiments are reported in the figure legends. Graphs display mean values with error bars that correspond to the standard error of the mean (mean ± SEM). The p value(s) reported in the figure legends are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s), if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true. They are denoted as: not significant (ns) p ≥ 0.05, ∗ p < 0.05, ∗∗ p < 0.01, ∗∗∗ p < 0.001, ∗∗∗∗ p < 0.0001.
Relative abundances at the species level were analyzed by R (v3.4.4) with the Phyloseq (1.22.3) and Vegan (2.5-3) packages. Species representing less than 2% of total reads among all samples were grouped into the “Other” category. Sorted populations from one individual were excluded due to contamination. For each species, the coating index (CI) was calculated using previously determined ( Kau et al., 2015 30. Kau, A.L. ∙ Planer, J.D. ∙ Liu, J. ... Functional characterization of IgA-targeted bacterial taxa from undernourished Malawian children that produce diet-dependent enteropathy Sci. Transl. Med. 2015; 7 :276ra24 Crossref Scopus (267) PubMed Google Scholar ), shown in Figure S2 C. Enrichment in antibody-bound or antibody-unbound populations was tested for each species by one-sample t test in GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software) to determine whether mean CI values deviated significantly from 0.
