Title: Local Axonal Conduction Shapes the Spatiotemporal Properties of Neural Sequences


Abstract: Summary

Sequential activation of neurons has been observed during various behavioral and cognitive processes, but the underlying circuit mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate premotor sequences in HVC (proper name) of the adult zebra finch forebrain that are central to the performance of the temporally precise courtship song. We use high-density silicon probes to measure song-related population activity, and we compare these observations with predictions from a range of network models. Our results support a circuit architecture in which heterogeneous delays between sequentially active neurons shape the spatiotemporal patterns of HVC premotor neuron activity. We gauge the impact of several delay sources, and we find the primary contributor to be slow conduction through axonal collaterals within HVC, which typically adds between 1 and 7.5 ms for each link within the sequence. Thus, local axonal “delay lines” can play an important role in determining the dynamical repertoire of neural circuits.

Section: Introduction

The zebra finch song system is ideally suited for studying the mechanistic basis of neural sequence generation. Each adult male zebra finch produces a courtship song that is nearly identical from one rendition to the next ( Glaze and Troyer, 2006 28. Glaze, C.M. ∙ Troyer, T.W. Temporal structure in zebra finch song: implications for motor coding J. Neurosci. 2006; 26 :991-1005 Crossref Scopus (114) PubMed Google Scholar ), consisting of ∼3–7 discrete vocal elements known as “syllables.” Many lines of evidence have suggested that neural activity controlling the moment-to-moment timing of song production is primarily mediated by a single brain region, called HVC (proper name) ( Hahnloser et al., 2002 31.

Identification of a forebrain motor programming network for the learned song of zebra finches J. Neurosci. 1994; 14 :6924-6934 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). A population of HVC (RA) projection neurons sends these premotor commands to a primary motor cortical site (i.e., the robust nucleus of the arcopallium, or RA) which in turn drives motoneurons ( Wild, 1993 85. Wild, J.M. Descending projections of the songbird nucleus robustus archistriatalis J. Comp. Neurol. 1993; 338 :225-241 Crossref Scopus (246) PubMed Google Scholar ) controlling the millisecond-resolution timing of muscle commands that directly impact behavioral output ( Adam and Elemans, 2020 2.

Neurosci. 2020; 40 :6722-6731 Crossref Scopus (7) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The HVC premotor sequence is composed of roughly 20,000 HVC (RA) neurons, each producing high-frequency bursts of action potentials (∼4–5 spikes/burst, ∼5–10 ms duration) at a single moment during the song ( Hahnloser et al., 2002 31. Hahnloser, R.H. ∙ Kozhevnikov, A.A. ∙ Fee, M.S.

At a population level, different HVC (RA) neurons are often active at different moments of the song, whose length typically ranges from ∼0.5–1.0 s. Several models have been proposed to explain HVC sequence generation ( Cannon et al., 2015 11. Cannon, J. ∙ Kopell, N. ∙ Gardner, T. ...

Commun. 2018; 9 :977 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ). A feature at the heart of many of these models is local connectivity between HVC (RA) neurons capable of propagating activity from earlier to later steps in the song sequence. Previous work had demonstrated the existence of these interconnections ( Kornfeld et al., 2017 43. Kornfeld, J. ∙ Benezra, S.E. ∙ Narayanan, R.T. ...

The HVC microcircuit: the synaptic basis for interactions between song motor and vocal plasticity pathways J. Neurosci. 2005; 25 :1952-1964 Crossref Scopus (128) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the size of HVC (RA) -HVC (RA) synapses appears to be somewhat restricted ( Kornfeld et al., 2017 43. Kornfeld, J. ∙ Benezra, S.E. ∙ Narayanan, R.T. ... EM connectomics reveals axonal target variation in a sequence-generating network eLife. 2017; 6 :e24364 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ), leading to unitary postsynaptic potentials of ∼2 mV ( Mooney and Prather, 2005 57. Mooney, R. ∙ Prather, J.F. The HVC microcircuit: the synaptic basis for interactions between song motor and vocal plasticity pathways J. Neurosci. 2005; 25 :1952-1964 Crossref Scopus (128) PubMed Google Scholar ), considerably smaller than the depolarization observed during a song-related burst (∼10–15 mV) ( Long et al., 2010 50. Long, M.A. ∙ Jin, D.Z. ∙ Fee, M.S. Support for a synaptic chain model of neuronal sequence generation Nature. 2010; 468 :394-399 Crossref Scopus (272) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting that multiple convergent presynaptic inputs are required. The exact identity of these presynaptic partners (i.e., specific timing, spatial location) remains unknown, due in part to the technical difficulties in measuring synaptic connectivity between sequentially active neurons during behavior.
As an alternative means of addressing the mechanisms of song-related sequence generation, we leverage detailed measurements of circuit, synaptic, and biophysical properties of zebra finch HVC neurons ( Benezra et al., 2018 7. Benezra, S.E. ∙ Narayanan, R.T. ∙ Egger, R. ... Morphological characterization of HVC projection neurons in the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) J. Comp.

The HVC microcircuit: the synaptic basis for interactions between song motor and vocal plasticity pathways J. Neurosci. 2005; 25 :1952-1964 Crossref Scopus (128) PubMed Google Scholar ) to develop network models of HVC (RA) sequence generation where the only free parameter is the connectivity of presynaptic partners. These models predict millisecond-timescale differences in HVC population activity that had eluded existing experimental measurements. Specifically, previous electrophysiological studies had been restricted to measuring responses from individual projection neurons ( Hahnloser et al., 2002 31. Hahnloser, R.H. ∙ Kozhevnikov, A.A. ∙ Fee, M.S. An ultra-sparse code underlies the generation of neural sequences in a songbird Nature. 2002; 419 :65-70 Crossref Scopus (766) PubMed Google Scholar ; Long et al., 2010 50. Long, M.A. ∙ Jin, D.Z. ∙ Fee, M.S. Support for a synaptic chain model of neuronal sequence generation Nature. 2010; 468 :394-399 Crossref Scopus (272) PubMed Google Scholar ) or occasionally pairs ( Lynch et al., 2016 52. Lynch, G.F. ∙ Okubo, T.S. ∙ Hanuschkin, A. ... Rhythmic Continuous-Time Coding in the Songbird Analog of Vocal Motor Cortex Neuron. 2016; 90 :877-892 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (65) PubMed Google Scholar ), forcing investigators to retrospectively construct an inferred sequence by relating each measured time point to the produced song. Such an approach can address questions of representation within HVC ( Amador et al., 2013 4. Amador, A. ∙ Perl, Y.S. ∙ Mindlin, G.B. ... Elemental gesture dynamics are encoded by song premotor cortical neurons Nature. 2013; 495 :59-64 Crossref Scopus (138) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lynch et al., 2016 52.

Rhythmic Continuous-Time Coding in the Songbird Analog of Vocal Motor Cortex Neuron. 2016; 90 :877-892 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (65) PubMed Google Scholar ), but it does not allow for the direct observation of neural sequences that unfold during singing.
We overcome these obstacles by using high-density silicon probes to measure song-related sequential activity of up to 70 simultaneously recorded projection neurons and find that our data strongly favor a network configuration in which axonal conduction delays between sequentially active cells help to distribute the timing of premotor bursts throughout the duration of the song. We then use fluorescence imaging during singing to demonstrate the impact of these delays on the spatial patterns of activated neurons within HVC. To explore the universality of this mechanism, we estimated the distribution of axonal conduction delays in rodent layer 4 (L4) neocortical neurons and found them to be consistent with those we describe in the songbird. Hence, axonal conduction delays may play a key role in shaping network activity across a range of local brain circuits.

Section: Results

We first sought to determine the fine temporal structure of song-related sequences within HVC using high-density silicon probes ( Figure 1 A), which we used to monitor the spiking activity of 291 HVC projection neurons in 5 birds during song production. We simultaneously recorded between 45 and 70 projection neurons over observation periods lasting 1 to 4.5 h. We used antidromic responses and other electrophysiological features ( Figure S1 ; STAR Methods ) to distinguish HVC (RA) neurons (n = 83) from those projecting to the basal ganglia (HVC (X) neurons, n = 208). We observed stable sequences (11 to 20 HVC (RA) burst events per bird) that could be clearly visualized in single trials ( Figures 1 B and 1C).
Previous manipulations of HVC activity during singing support the idea that song-related sequences are sustained by local circuitry ( Long and Fee, 2008 49. Long, M.A. ∙ Fee, M.S. Using temperature to analyse temporal dynamics in the songbird motor pathway Nature. 2008; 456 :189-194 Crossref Scopus (353) PubMed Google Scholar ; Vu et al., 1994 84.

As discussed above, most network models ( Galvis et al., 2017 23. Galvis, D. ∙ Wu, W. ∙ Hyson, R.L. ... A distributed neural network model for the distinct roles of medial and lateral HVC in zebra finch song production J. Neurophysiol. 2017; 118 :677-692 Crossref Scopus (10) PubMed Google Scholar ; Long et al., 2010 50. Long, M.A. ∙ Jin, D.Z. ∙ Fee, M.S. Support for a synaptic chain model of neuronal sequence generation Nature. 2010; 468 :394-399 Crossref Scopus (272) PubMed Google Scholar ; Pehlevan et al., 2018 66. Pehlevan, C. ∙ Ali, F. ∙ Ölveczky, B.P. Flexibility in motor timing constrains the topology and dynamics of pattern generator circuits Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :977 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ) suggest a functionally feedforward architecture in which connected chains of neurons generate reliable sequential activity, and it is likely that convergent inputs from multiple presynaptic partner neurons are required to drive burst spiking during singing ( Figure 1 D). There are two categorically different means of accomplishing this arrangement. In the first, each HVC (RA) neuron is driven by a synchronously active presynaptic population ( Figure 1 E). In the second, presynaptic populations are active at a range of different times which are accompanied by matching delays that enable simultaneous integration at the postsynaptic neuron ( Figure 1 F).
To examine whether these connectivity schemes could result in measurable differences in the population activity of HVC (RA) neurons, we constructed two network models ( Figure S2 ; STAR Methods ) constrained by previous experimental observations ( Benezra et al., 2018 7. Benezra, S.E. ∙ Narayanan, R.T. ∙ Egger, R. ... Morphological characterization of HVC projection neurons in the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) J. Comp.

The HVC microcircuit: the synaptic basis for interactions between song motor and vocal plasticity pathways J. Neurosci. 2005; 25 :1952-1964 Crossref Scopus (128) PubMed Google Scholar ) and differing only in the degree of synchrony of presynaptic neurons. Resultant population activity patterns from these two arrangements were categorically distinct: sequences in the “synchronous model” ( Figure 1 E) consisted of a series of co-active groups of neurons, while network activity in the “asynchronous model” ( Figure 1 F) was smoothly evolving in time. Because HVC determines motor timing within the zebra finch song production pathway, each model suggests qualitatively different “population clock” dynamics ( Buonomano and Karmarkar, 2002 9. Buonomano, D.V. ∙ Karmarkar, U.R. How do we tell time? Neuroscientist. 2002; 8 :42-51 Crossref Scopus (160) PubMed Google Scholar ; Paton and Buonomano, 2018 64. Paton, J.J. ∙ Buonomano, D.V. The Neural Basis of Timing: Distributed Mechanisms for Diverse Functions Neuron. 2018; 98 :687-705 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (220) PubMed Google Scholar )—either with discrete “ticks” at a ∼6–7 ms timescale (synchronous model) or with a higher resolution, continuous timing signal throughout the behavior (asynchronous model).
To distinguish between synchronous and asynchronous network activity, our measurements must be significantly more precise than the relevant timescales of our model predictions (i.e., the interburst interval of the synchronous model). One existing source of temporal jitter is behavioral variability. Consistent with previous reports ( Glaze and Troyer, 2006 28. Glaze, C.M. ∙ Troyer, T.W. Temporal structure in zebra finch song: implications for motor coding J. Neurosci. 2006; 26 :991-1005 Crossref Scopus (114) PubMed Google Scholar ), the duration of zebra finch songs in our dataset varied by 1.8% ± 0.4% across renditions ( Figure 2 A, n = 5 birds, 12 to 47 song motif renditions per bird). These variations were accompanied by correlated differences in spike timing, where activity of neurons later in the sequence was shifted in proportion to the change in overall song duration ( Figures 2 B and 2C). To compensate for this source of variability, we aligned neural sequences across different trials to each other using linear transformations ( STAR Methods ). After alignment, burst onset times were extremely precise ( Figures 2 D and 2E; HVC (RA) : 0.64 ± 0.29 ms; HVC (X) : 0.72 ± 0.46 ms; median ± median absolute deviation). Therefore, our electrophysiological measurements of HVC projection neuron activity have the temporal precision to distinguish between the two models presented above ( Figures 1 E and 1F).
Our next step was to leverage the submillisecond timing precision of our recordings to test specific predictions concerning the relative timing of song-related burst firing: in the synchronous model ( Figure 1 E), network activity should be periodic (i.e., occurring only in specific time steps), while the asynchronous model ( Figure 1 F) predicts continuous coverage of activity throughout the song. We examined cases in which multiple projection neurons were recorded during individual syllables, consisting of 66 HVC (RA) and 216 HVC (X) total bursts. Burst events within syllables did not exhibit any obvious regularity ( Figures 2 F and 2G), which would have been indicative of the synchronous model. To detect the presence of any such periodic structure in population activity, we used a Fourier analysis to analyze burst onset times for all HVC projection neurons as well as for HVC (RA) neurons, considered separately ( Figure 2 G).
We formally tested existing network models by comparing the relative timing of HVC projection neuron bursts ( Figure 2 ) with predictions generated from the proposed synchronous and asynchronous circuit configurations ( Figures 1 E, 1F, 3 A, and 3B). Importantly, we set the number of simulated burst times to match our observations (i.e., 282 total HVC projection neuron bursts in 22 syllables and 66 HVC (RA) bursts in 15 syllables) to ensure that our dataset would be sufficient to distinguish between these models. The synchronous model predicted a peak in the power spectrum at ∼170 Hz ( Figures 3 C and S3 ), corresponding to an ∼6 ms interval between time steps ( Figure 1 E). In contrast, the power spectrum predicted by the asynchronous model, which generates a uniform coverage of bursts throughout the song ( Figure 1 F), was flat within this frequency range ( Figure 3 D). When we compared these simulations with measured burst times, we found that our dataset was strongly aligned with the predictions of the asynchronous model (synchronous model: p < 10 −4 for HVC projection neurons and HVC (RA) only, asynchronous model: p = 0.90 for HVC projection neurons and p = 0.52 for HVC (RA) neurons, bootstrap, see STAR Methods ).
The synchronous and asynchronous models represent only two specific network configurations out of a large range of possibilities. To systematically explore the relationship between burst transmission delays and circuit dynamics, we varied both the mean ( Figure 3 E) and standard deviation (SD) ( Figure 3 F) of our delay distribution over an order of magnitude. We then generated a network model for each case and simulated a family of burst times to compare with observed data, now restricting our analysis to measured sequences of HVC (RA) neurons ( Figures 2 G, 3 C, and 3D). When the delay distribution was narrow or the mean delay was very short, simulated HVC sequences were composed of bursts in discrete time steps. However, delay distributions exceeding a minimum mean and SD, led to smooth simulated network sequences, as observed in HVC during song ( Figure 3 G). This effect was robust to the presence of recurrent (i.e., non-feedforward) connections ( Figures S4 A and S4B) as well as the precise shape of the delay distribution ( Figure S4 C). Thus, our simulations support the hypothesis that delays could provide a robust mechanism for the formation of smooth sequences, as observed within HVC during song.
What neural processes can create such delays? For instance, the time between the arrival of a spike at the axon terminal to the start of the postsynaptic potential is typically exceptionally short (∼150 μs) ( Sabatini and Regehr, 1996 75. Sabatini, B.L. ∙ Regehr, W.G. Timing of neurotransmission at fast synapses in the mammalian brain Nature. 1996; 384 :170-172 Crossref Scopus (333) PubMed Google Scholar ) and therefore unlikely to explain the smooth network sequences we observe. On the other hand, delays related to postsynaptic integration and axonal conduction velocity have the potential to be significant. Here, we consider each of these parameters as they apply to HVC network function.
Postsynaptic integration can generate heterogeneous delays in two primary ways. First, synaptic inputs are spatially summated from separate regions of the dendritic arbor allowing for the possibility that distal and proximal inputs can arrive at the soma at different times. Such spatial summation is unlikely to affect HVC (RA) neurons, however, as their dendrites are short (<100 μm) and radiate from the somata equally in all directions, leading to a spherical shape of the dendritic tree ( Benezra et al., 2018 7. Benezra, S.E. ∙ Narayanan, R.T. ∙ Egger, R. ... Morphological characterization of HVC projection neurons in the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) J. Comp. Neurol. 2018; 526 :1673-1689 Crossref Scopus (10) PubMed Google Scholar ) and therefore limiting delay variability. Second, neuronal time constants, which affect the timescale over which synaptic inputs could be summated, can differ greatly within specific cell classes, potentially influencing network function ( Giocomo and Hasselmo, 2008 27. Giocomo, L.M. ∙ Hasselmo, M.E. Time constants of h current in layer ii stellate cells differ along the dorsal to ventral axis of medial entorhinal cortex J. Neurosci. 2008; 28 :9414-9425 Crossref Scopus (91) PubMed Google Scholar ). To directly address this feature in HVC, we reanalyzed a published dataset of intracellular recordings performed during singing ( Long et al., 2010 50. Long, M.A. ∙ Jin, D.Z. ∙ Fee, M.S. Support for a synaptic chain model of neuronal sequence generation Nature. 2010; 468 :394-399 Crossref Scopus (272) PubMed Google Scholar ; Vallentin and Long, 2015 83. Vallentin, D. ∙ Long, M.A. Motor origin of precise synaptic inputs onto forebrain neurons driving a skilled behavior J. Neurosci. 2015; 35 :299-307 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that temporal summation—defined as the time course of the depolarization immediately preceding a burst—was highly consistent across neurons (2.31 ± 0.37 ms, n = 11; Figures 4 A–4C). We modified our network models to explicitly reflect different degrees of temporal summation in HVC (RA) neurons by parametrically varying their passive integrative properties ( STAR Methods ). These simulations suggest that differences in temporal summation across neurons cannot account for the smooth network sequences observed ( Figure 4 D), further excluding a postsynaptic mechanism as a significant source of network delay.
We then explored the alternative possibility that local connections between HVC (RA) neurons could exhibit delays related to the time required for an action potential to travel from its initiation site near the neuronal soma to axon terminals (i.e., axonal conduction delays). In previous work ( Benezra et al., 2018 7. Benezra, S.E. ∙ Narayanan, R.T. ∙ Egger, R. ... Morphological characterization of HVC projection neurons in the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) J. Comp. Neurol. 2018; 526 :1673-1689 Crossref Scopus (10) PubMed Google Scholar ), we had found that HVC (RA) neurons often send extensive axonal collaterals throughout HVC, and we used 22 complete reconstructions to estimate the distance from the soma to each of the synaptic sites along the axon, a log-normal distribution ranging from 0.19 to 1.34 mm (5 th to 95 th percentiles). To convert these path length measurements into axonal delays, we needed to measure the conduction velocity of local HVC (RA) axon collaterals, which are thin and difficult to record. However, we could estimate these values using in vivo whole-cell recordings (n = 40 HVC (RA) neurons) to measure conduction velocity in antidromically activated HVC → RA projection axons ( Figures 5 A and S5 A; STAR Methods ), a path distance of 2.8 ± 0.2 mm (n = 4 neurons) ( Figure 5 B). We then corrected for differences in axon diameter (descending axon: 446 ± 135 nm, local collaterals: 167 ± 73 nm) using cable theory ( Rushton, 1951 74. Rushton, W.A. A theory of the effects of fibre size in medullated nerve J. Physiol. 1951; 115 :101-122 Crossref Scopus (758) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figures 5 C, 5D, and S5 B–S5D; STAR Methods ). Assuming homogeneous biophysical properties (i.e., channel density) across the axon, we arrived at a final estimated conduction velocity of 0.187 ± 0.035 mm/ms, corresponding to conduction delays ranging from 1 to 7.5 ms (5 th and 95 th percentiles) ( Figure 5 E). Our network model demonstrates that these values are sufficient to enable HVC to generate smooth sequences ( Figure 5 F). Taken together, we find that axonal conduction delays contribute significantly to network dynamics within HVC.
We have demonstrated that axonal conduction delays may have the capacity to significantly impact the temporal structure of the HVC network, potentially leading to continuous burst events throughout song. We next asked whether the impact of axonal delays can be detected in the spatial properties of HVC circuit dynamics. Because synapses located closer to the soma are activated after shorter delays than those further away ( Figure 5 E), we reasoned that the spatial distribution of the synapses responsible for driving the next step of the HVC sequence can provide an independent test of the range of delays underlying HVC network dynamics. To investigate this, we generated “spatial models” for a variety of delay distributions, varying the mean and SD values as in the above analysis ( Figure 3 G). For each model, we placed “virtual synapses” at specific locations onto 22 morphologically reconstructed HVC (RA) axon collaterals ( Benezra et al., 2018 7. Benezra, S.E. ∙ Narayanan, R.T. ∙ Egger, R. ... Morphological characterization of HVC projection neurons in the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) J. Comp. Neurol. 2018; 526 :1673-1689 Crossref Scopus (10) PubMed Google Scholar ) corresponding to the selected delay distributions given our estimate of conduction velocity. For instance, in cases in which the conduction delays were long but exhibited a low variance, synapses were clustered on distal axons ( Figures 6 A). We also considered cases in which the means of the conduction delays were low, across different variance conditions ( Figures 6 B and 6C). We compare these possibilities against a scenario in which the mean and variance were both relatively high ( Figure 6 D), as we estimate for HVC delays. Because of the differential placement of synapses within the axonal field, each model should result in a different prediction concerning the spatiotemporal pattern of activity ( Graber et al., 2013 30. Graber, M.H. ∙ Helmchen, F. ∙ Hahnloser, R.H. Activity in a premotor cortical nucleus of zebra finches is locally organized and exhibits auditory selectivity in neurons but not in glia PLoS ONE. 2013; 8 :e81177 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ; Markowitz et al., 2015 53. Markowitz, J.E. ∙ Liberti, 3rd, W.A. ∙ Guitchounts, G. ...

Neurosci. 2015; 35 :5589-5605 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ) in HVC during singing (i.e., the location of postsynaptic neurons that represent the next step within the sequence).
To examine these song-related spatial patterns, we performed 2-photon imaging of GCaMP6-expressing projection neurons during singing. We combined new observations with a previously published dataset ( Katlowitz et al., 2018 41. Katlowitz, K.A. ∙ Picardo, M.A. ∙ Long, M.A. Stable Sequential Activity Underlying the Maintenance of a Precisely Executed Skilled Behavior Neuron. 2018; 98 :1133-1140 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ; Picardo et al., 2016 68.

Using established techniques ( Picardo et al., 2016 68. Picardo, M.A. ∙ Merel, J. ∙ Katlowitz, K.A. ... Population-Level Representation of a Temporal Sequence Underlying Song Production in the Zebra Finch Neuron. 2016; 90 :866-876 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (81) PubMed Google Scholar ; Pnevmatikakis et al., 2016 70.

Simultaneous Denoising, Deconvolution, and Demixing of Calcium Imaging Data Neuron. 2016; 89 :285-299 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (599) PubMed Google Scholar ), we precisely estimated burst onset times with a temporal resolution of ∼10 ms and related these values to the spatial position for each neuron ( Figure 6 F). We then determined the relative locations and burst time differences of all neuron pairs (n = 5,842 pairs). We excluded all cases with a difference in burst times greater than 20 ms (n = 5,582 pairs, 95.5%) and therefore unlikely to be driven by monosynaptic connections. In the remaining 260 cases, sequentially active neuron pairs were found over a wide range of relative locations (178 ± 102 μm, mean ± SD), from immediately adjacent (∼10 μm) to much longer distances (∼500 μm, or approximately one third of the maximum extent of HVC) ( Figures 6 G and 6H). These functional data were most similar to the simulation based on our estimates of local HVC conduction values ( Figures 6 I and S6 ). We extended our analysis to consider a wider range of delay distributions and found a family of solutions whose predicted spatial patterns correlated significantly (r > 0.6, p < 0.05, two-sided t test) with our imaging data ( Figure 6 J). Importantly, these independently observed solutions overlapped both with the estimated axonal delays ( Figure 5 F) and the range of models in which HVC forms smooth sequences ( Figure 3 G), consistent with asynchronous functional connectivity between HVC (RA) neurons based on local axonal delays.
We have demonstrated the impact of local axonal delays on the timing and structure of network activity within HVC of the zebra finch. Given the extraordinarily slow axonal conduction velocity in HVC compared with known values measured in a variety of different circuits ( Figure 7 A), it remains unclear whether such delays will play a role within those networks or whether this solution is simply a specialization within zebra finch HVC. We began to examine this issue by analyzing the local collaterals of 14 spiny neurons in layer 4 of rat somatosensory cortex ( Figure 7 B; Narayanan et al., 2015 58. Narayanan, R.T. ∙ Egger, R. ∙ Johnson, A.S. ... Beyond Columnar Organization: Cell Type- and Target Layer-Specific Principles of Horizontal Axon Projection Patterns in Rat Vibrissal Cortex Cereb. Cortex. 2015; 25 :4450-4468 Crossref Scopus (75) PubMed Google Scholar ). When we measured the path length from the soma to different locations along the axon, we found that the entire size of the axonal field was considerably larger than that of HVC (RA) neurons ( Figure 7 C). Surprisingly, when we estimated conduction delays—accounting for both the discrepancies in conduction velocity and path length—we find that the range of these values is identical in both cell classes (L4: 3.4 ± 2.3 ms, HVC (RA) : 3.3 ± 2.1 ms) ( Figure 7 D). Therefore, conduction delays could potentially play an important computational role within a broad range of neural circuits.

Section: Discussion

Using a combination of modeling and experimental approaches, we investigated how local excitatory circuits can give rise to convergent synaptic input underlying sequential activity in the zebra finch song system. We used silicon probes to enable single-trial electrophysiological measurements of song-related sequences within HVC, observations that support a central role for slow and heterogeneous delays in HVC network dynamics. We further demonstrate that these delays are likely due to conduction properties of HVC axon collaterals, and we show that this circuit feature may influence the spatiotemporal patterns of HVC activity observed during singing. Taken together, we have shown that axonal conduction velocity can lead to a continuous distribution of premotor bursts, which facilitates the placement of descending motor commands at any time point during the song. Furthermore, we estimate that conduction delays are significantly larger than those afforded by other biophysical parameters. Approximately half of the total elapsed time of the HVC sequence could be attributed to local axonal conduction, a comparatively inflexible process that may underlie the behavioral stereotypy inherent in the adult zebra finch song ( Lombardino and Nottebohm, 2000 48. Lombardino, A.J. ∙ Nottebohm, F. Age at deafening affects the stability of learned song in adult male zebra finches J. Neurosci. 2000; 20 :5054-5064 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) by rendering the circuit less sensitive to perturbations ( Hamaguchi et al., 2016 32. Hamaguchi, K. ∙ Tanaka, M. ∙ Mooney, R.

Neurol. 1981; 71 :383-389 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Previous models of premotor sequence generation have suggested that HVC feedforward networks ( Galvis et al., 2017 23. Galvis, D. ∙ Wu, W. ∙ Hyson, R.L. ...

Diesmann, M. ∙ Gewaltig, M.O. ∙ Aertsen, A. Stable propagation of synchronous spiking in cortical neural networks Nature. 1999; 402 :529-533 Crossref Scopus (737) PubMed Google Scholar ). In our study, we find that the synchronous model—which is functionally equivalent to the synfire chain configuration—makes predictions about network timing that are inconsistent with our observations. Sufficiently heterogeneous delays change the regime of these feedforward networks to smoothly evolving dynamics. The asynchronous HVC model, strongly supported by our data, has fundamental similarities with previously described “polychronous” networks, which are capable of generating almost arbitrary neural sequences in the presence of a suitable range of delays ( Izhikevich, 2006 37. Izhikevich, E.M. Polychronization: computation with spikes Neural Comput. 2006; 18 :245-282 Crossref Scopus (801) PubMed Google Scholar ). A salient feature of polychronous networks is the potential to self-organize such connectivity patterns through spike timing-dependent plasticity mechanisms ( Gerstner et al., 1996 25. Gerstner, W. ∙ Kempter, R. ∙ van Hemmen, J.L. ...

Polychronization: computation with spikes Neural Comput. 2006; 18 :245-282 Crossref Scopus (801) PubMed Google Scholar ), and future work will determine the relevance of axonal delays for assembly of HVC circuits during song learning ( Fiete et al., 2010 20.

A potential limitation of our model is its exclusive focus on local excitatory connectivity within HVC ( Kornfeld et al., 2017 43. Kornfeld, J. ∙ Benezra, S.E. ∙ Narayanan, R.T. ...

The role of other circuit elements, such as local inhibitory interneurons, in controlling song-related HVC (RA) neuron activity also remains to be explored ( Gibb et al., 2009 26.

Furthermore, in addition to local synapses within HVC, premotor neurons also receive excitatory connections from other brain regions ( Akutagawa and Konishi, 2010 3. Akutagawa, E. ∙ Konishi, M.

For example, inputs from the thalamic nucleus Uvaeformis may be instrumental in initiating ( Andalman et al., 2011 6. Andalman, A.S. ∙ Foerster, J.N. ∙ Fee, M.S.

A Distributed Recurrent Network Contributes to Temporally Precise Vocalizations Neuron. 2016; 91 :680-693 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ) HVC sequential activity.
The idea that axons contribute to information processing in neural circuits has long been explored for long-range connections between different brain areas ( Carr and Konishi, 1988 12. Carr, C.E. ∙ Konishi, M. Axonal delay lines for time measurement in the owl’s brainstem Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1988; 85 :8311-8315 Crossref Scopus (254) PubMed Google Scholar ; Innocenti et al., 1994 36. Innocenti, G.M. ∙ Lehmann, P. ∙ Houzel, J.C. Computational structure of visual callosal axons Eur. J.

Change of conduction velocity by regional myelination yields constant latency irrespective of distance between thalamus and cortex Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100 :6174-6179 Crossref Scopus (223) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sugihara et al., 1993 81. Sugihara, I. ∙ Lang, E.J. ∙ Llinás, R. Uniform olivocerebellar conduction time underlies Purkinje cell complex spike synchronicity in the rat cerebellum J. Physiol. 1993; 470 :243-271 Crossref Scopus (148) PubMed Google Scholar ). For instance, in the brainstem of the barn owl, axons carrying sound information from both ears form precisely tuned and spatially organized “delay lines” ( Jeffress, 1948 38. Jeffress, L.A. A place theory of sound localization J. Comp. Physiol. Psychol. 1948; 41 :35-39 Crossref Scopus (1089) PubMed Google Scholar ) necessary for detecting minute interaural time differences ( Carr and Konishi, 1988 12. Carr, C.E. ∙ Konishi, M. Axonal delay lines for time measurement in the owl’s brainstem Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1988; 85 :8311-8315 Crossref Scopus (254) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast, the role of axonal delays within local microcircuits is often disregarded ( Budd et al., 2010 8. Budd, J.M. ∙ Kovács, K. ∙ Ferecskó, A.S. ... Neocortical axon arbors trade-off material and conduction delay conservation PLoS Comput. Biol. 2010; 6 :e1000711 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ), possibly because of the technical challenges involved in obtaining reliable estimates of conduction velocity in local circuits or because of a tenuous relationship between brain activity and behavior. In this study, we find that spatiotemporal patterns within HVC appear to be strongly influenced by “local delay lines.” We do not yet know whether this specialization is unique to circuits in which a high degree of temporal precision is required or whether it can be more broadly found in other networks, including those capable of more flexibility ( Cohen et al., 2020 15.

Neurosci. 2011; 31 :10023-10033 Crossref Scopus (87) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although we find that conduction delays along intracortical axons in a rodent neocortical area are likely to be comparable to those reported here in zebra finch HVC, the extent to which these collaterals may support persistent activity ( Sachidhanandam et al., 2013 76.

Neurosci. 2013; 16 :1671-1677 Crossref Scopus (255) PubMed Google Scholar ) or some other aspect of processing ( Wilson et al., 2011 86. Wilson, S.P. ∙ Bednar, J.A. ∙ Prescott, T.J. ... Neural computation via neural geometry: a place code for inter-whisker timing in the barrel cortex? PLoS Comput. Biol. 2011; 7 :e1002188 Crossref Scopus (5) PubMed Google Scholar ) within this region so far remains unexplored. Further work in other circuits can establish whether this delay distribution represents a universal scaling law ( Buzsáki and Mizuseki, 2014 10. Buzsáki, G. ∙ Mizuseki, K.

A Psychobiological Theory Harwood Academic Publisher, 1996 Google Scholar ) across different species, brain regions, cell types, etc., or whether these local delays are specially tuned for the requirements of each unique case. Overall, our results suggest that in addition to defining the static architecture of neural networks ( Denk et al., 2012 18. Denk, W. ∙ Briggman, K.L. ∙ Helmstaedter, M.

Seung, H.S.

We used adult (> 90 days posthatch) male zebra finches ( Taeniopygia guttata ) that were obtained from an outside breeder and maintained in a temperature- and humidity-controlled environment with a 12/12 hr light/dark schedule. All animal maintenance and experimental procedures were performed according to the guidelines established by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the New York University Langone Medical Center.
Surgical procedures for retrograde labeling of HVC (RA) neurons, viral injections, chronic cranial window implantation for 2-photon imaging, intracellular microelectrode recordings, and in vivo whole-cell recordings have previously been described in detail ( Kornfeld et al., 2017 43.

For extracellular recordings, high-density silicon probes (128 channels; Diagnostic Biochips) were mounted to a microdrive (NeuroNexus), and a stainless steel ground wire (0.001,” California Fine Wires) was soldered to the reference of the headstage, which was held in place by a custom 3D printed enclosure (Formlabs). A craniotomy (∼1 mm length x 100 μm width) was made over HVC (2.3 mm lateral / 0.25 mm anterior of the bifurcation of the sagittal sinus). Silicon probes were implanted at a depth of ∼500-800 μm in HVC. Silicon elastomer (Kwik Cast, WPI) was applied to the craniotomy and dental acrylic was used to secure the microdrive and the enclosure for the headstage in place. For antidromic activation of HVC (RA) neurons, a bipolar stimulation electrode was implanted into RA.
Neural activity of freely moving birds was recorded using an electrically assisted commutator (Doric Lenses) and the RHD USB Interface Board or RHD Recording Controller (Intan Technologies). Vocalizations were recorded using an omnidirectional microphone (Audio - Technica) and a preamplifier (Presonus). Antidromic stimulation was applied using biphasic current pulses of 20 μs duration and amplitudes between 20-500 μA. To help characterize cell types ( Figure S1 ), we also reanalyzed a previously reported dataset of identified HVC neurons ( Lynch et al., 2016 52. Lynch, G.F. ∙ Okubo, T.S. ∙ Hanuschkin, A. ...

Spike detection and clustering was performed using KiloSort software ( Pachitariu et al., 2016 62. Pachitariu, M. ∙ Steinmetz, N. ∙ Kadir, S. ... Kilosort: realtime spike-sorting for extracellular electrophysiology with hundreds of channels bioRxiv. 2016; Crossref Google Scholar ) and manual post-processing (merging/splitting of clusters) was performed using phy ( Rossant et al., 2016 73. Rossant, C. ∙ Kadir, S.N. ∙ Goodman, D.F.M. ... Spike sorting for large, dense electrode arrays Nat. Neurosci. 2016; 19 :634-641 Crossref Scopus (468) PubMed Google Scholar ). Spike times of all clusters were aligned to onsets and offsets of song motifs. Reliable burst events across motifs that are characteristic of HVC projection neuron activity ( Hahnloser et al., 2002 31. Hahnloser, R.H. ∙ Kozhevnikov, A.A. ∙ Fee, M.S. An ultra-sparse code underlies the generation of neural sequences in a songbird Nature. 2002; 419 :65-70 Crossref Scopus (766) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kozhevnikov and Fee, 2007 45. Kozhevnikov, A.A. ∙ Fee, M.S. Singing-related activity of identified HVC neurons in the zebra finch J. Neurophysiol. 2007; 97 :4271-4283 Crossref Scopus (181) PubMed Google Scholar ) were readily apparent. Clusters lacking these events were not considered any further. The remaining clusters often exhibited more than one burst event and non-zero spontaneous spiking activity (defined as spiking in 5-minute windows before and after each song bout). To determine whether multiple bursts and/or spontaneous activity (if present) in one cluster were likely to originate from the same or multiple, erroneously combined units, we compared the waveforms and amplitude distribution of spontaneous spikes to those of the first spike from each bursting event across multiple channels. Specifically, we only considered bursts and/or spontaneous activity to originate from different units if they differed in both waveform and amplitude distribution. Here, amplitude similarity between the first spikes in bursts and/or spontaneous activity was measured by determining the amplitude (i.e., difference between maximum and minimum of the spike waveform) on each electrode, normalizing these values to the maximum amplitude across channels and computing the mean amplitude distribution for all first spikes in a burst/spontaneous spikes. We then determined the 8 electrodes with the largest mean amplitudes and computed the inner product of the normalized amplitude distribution on these electrodes for all pairwise combinations of first spikes of the same burst event/spontaneous spikes (i.e., generating a null distribution for each burst event/spontaneous activity). We next repeated the calculation of this inner product between all pairwise combinations of first spikes of different burst events/spontaneous spikes and determined whether these distributions were different from the null distributions. After identifying bursting units in this way, we computed their spontaneous activity. Single-bursting units were classified as HVC (RA) neurons if their spontaneous activity was less than the lowest spontaneous firing rates of HVC (X) neurons (antidromically identified previously ( Lynch et al., 2016 52.

First, we determined a reference song motif to which neural sequences in all other motifs were aligned. We chose the motif with a duration closest to the mean motif duration (motif m ). For alignment of sequences in individual syllables, we first determined during which (if any) syllable individual bursts occurred. Sequences in individual syllables were aligned independently of sequences in other syllables in the following way: For each motif n , we created a vector 𝑡 𝑛 of all burst onset times throughout the motif. We then fitted an affine transformation 𝑡 ′ 𝑛 = 𝑎 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑡 𝑛 + 𝑏 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑚 minimizing the squared difference between aligned burst times in trial n and the reference trial m ( 𝑡 ′ 𝑛 − 𝑡 𝑚 ) 𝑇 ⁢ ( 𝑡 ′ 𝑛 − 𝑡 𝑚 ) . Burst timing jitter was defined as the root mean squared error of aligned burst times across motifs. Sequences of HVC (RA) and HVC (X) bursts were aligned separately. We only performed this alignment for syllables which contained at least three bursts.
For serial block-face electron microscopic (SBEM) imaging, perfusion and histology was performed as described in detail previously ( Kornfeld et al., 2017 43. Kornfeld, J. ∙ Benezra, S.E. ∙ Narayanan, R.T. ... EM connectomics reveals axonal target variation in a sequence-generating network eLife. 2017; 6 :e24364 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ). For transmission electron-microscopic imaging, the protocol used for SBEM imaging was slightly modified as follows. After the bird was transcardially perfused, the brain was removed from the skull and post-fixed overnight ( Kornfeld et al., 2017 43. Kornfeld, J. ∙ Benezra, S.E. ∙ Narayanan, R.T. ... EM connectomics reveals axonal target variation in a sequence-generating network eLife. 2017; 6 :e24364 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ). The brain was then cut into 100 μm thick slices using a vibratome (Leica VT1000S). Residual peroxidase activity was suppressed by soaking the sample in 3% H 2 O 2 for 20 min before labeling the sample with an avidin-peroxidase complex and DAB. A slice containing clearly visible stained fibers from HVC to RA was unmounted by immersing the microscope slide into PB. After washing with PB, the samples were post fixed in 1% OsO 4 for 2 hours, block stained with 1% uranyl acetate for 1 hour, dehydrated in ethanol and embedded in EMbed 812 (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA). Semi-thin sections were cut at 1 μm and stained with 1% toluidine blue to find the previously identified area of interest containing fibers from HVC to RA. In each sample, 20 serial ultrathin sections with 100 nm thickness were cut, mounted on slot copper grids, and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate.
Stained grids were examined under a Philips CM-12 electron microscope (FEI; Eindhoven, the Netherlands) and photographed with a Gatan (4k x 2.7k) digital camera (Gatan, Inc., Pleasanton, CA). Samples were imaged at a series of increasing magnifications (i.e., ranging from 3,400x to 66,000x magnification) to allow identification of fiber tracts and ultimately individual fibers within these tracts. Diameter measurements of unmyelinated projection axons were made on images with a magnification of at least 40,000x.
All light micrographs used for illustration of local and descending axons were captured using a Zeiss AxioObserver Inverted. We acquired images of descending HVC (RA) neuron axons from ultrathin sections using a transmission electron microscope (see above). Unmyelinated descending axons were identified based on dark DAB labeling in EM micrographs. Myelinated axons were identified morphologically by presence of multiple, closely wrapped membrane layers (i.e., myelin sheaths; Figures S5 B and S5C). Diameters were measured along the shortest axis of the circumference of each axon (i.e., axons are roughly cylindrical, and this corresponds to the diameter of the cylinder irrespective of sectioning angle) ( Figure S5 D). Diameters of local HVC (RA) neuron collaterals were measured using a previously reported dataset acquired using serial block-face EM ( Kornfeld et al., 2017 43. Kornfeld, J. ∙ Benezra, S.E. ∙ Narayanan, R.T. ... EM connectomics reveals axonal target variation in a sequence-generating network eLife. 2017; 6 :e24364 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ) with a voxel size of 11 × 11 × 29 nm 3 containing HVC (RA) neurons labeled by injection of a tracer (BDA-dextran) into RA. Diameters of randomly selected locations along labeled local axon collaterals were measured by determining the image plane that was closest to the orthogonal plane defined by the axon and measuring the axon diameter in that plane.
Conduction delays along local HVC (RA) neuron axons were obtained by measuring the pathlength from the soma to points along the axon spaced at the mean inter-bouton interval of HVC (RA) neuron axons (10.5 μm) ( Kornfeld et al., 2017 43. Kornfeld, J. ∙ Benezra, S.E. ∙ Narayanan, R.T. ... EM connectomics reveals axonal target variation in a sequence-generating network eLife. 2017; 6 :e24364 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ). Combining these measurements from 22 reconstructions of premotor neuron axons reported previously ( Benezra et al., 2018 7. Benezra, S.E. ∙ Narayanan, R.T. ∙ Egger, R. ... Morphological characterization of HVC projection neurons in the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) J. Comp. Neurol. 2018; 526 :1673-1689 Crossref Scopus (10) PubMed Google Scholar ) resulted in an average distribution of pathlengths. We then converted these pathlengths into a conduction delay distribution by multiplying each pathlength distance with the conduction velocity of long-range axons. A log-normal distribution described the shape of the conduction delay distribution well (least-squares fit R 2 = 0.9988). We therefore used mean and standard deviation of a log-normal distribution to parameterize the conduction delays for the network models ( Figures 1 E, 1F, and 3 ).
Conduction delays along L4 spiny neuron axons were estimated in the same way. We measured the distribution of pathlength distances of 14 complete reconstructions of the intracortical axonal arbor of L4 neurons labeled in vivo ( Narayanan et al., 2015 58. Narayanan, R.T. ∙ Egger, R. ∙ Johnson, A.S. ... Beyond Columnar Organization: Cell Type- and Target Layer-Specific Principles of Horizontal Axon Projection Patterns in Rat Vibrissal Cortex Cereb. Cortex. 2015; 25 :4450-4468 Crossref Scopus (75) PubMed Google Scholar ) and multiplied pathlengths by a conduction velocity of 0.3 mm/ms ( Hirsch and Gilbert, 1991 33. Hirsch, J.A. ∙ Gilbert, C.D. Synaptic physiology of horizontal connections in the cat’s visual cortex J. Neurosci. 1991; 11 :1800-1809 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Shu et al., 2007 80. Shu, Y. ∙ Duque, A. ∙ Yu, Y. ... Properties of action-potential initiation in neocortical pyramidal cells: evidence from whole cell axon recordings J. Neurophysiol. 2007; 97 :746-760 Crossref Scopus (161) PubMed Google Scholar ) to obtain the conduction delay distribution.
The conduction time along long-range axons from HVC to RA was measured from whole-cell membrane potential recordings of HVC (RA) neurons as the difference between the onset time of antidromic stimulation in RA and action potential onset. The action potential onset was defined by calculating the second derivative of the membrane potential between 0-20 ms after stimulation and determining the first upward threshold crossing, where the threshold was set as the minimum of either 3 standard deviations of the second derivative or 400 mV/ms 2 . To determine the threshold between groups of conduction delays, we used k-means clustering with two groups. The pathlength of the long-range axon of HVC (RA) neurons was measured from the soma to the first bifurcation of the axon as it entered RA. The average conduction velocity of unmyelinated descending axons was calculated by dividing the average descending pathlength by the average conduction time of the second mode of the conduction time distribution ( Figure S5 A). We then used a simple biophysical model relating the diameter of unmyelinated axons to conduction velocity ( Hodgkin and Huxley, 1952 34. Hodgkin, A.L. ∙ Huxley, A.F. A quantitative description of membrane current and its application to conduction and excitation in nerve J. Physiol. 1952; 117 :500-544 Crossref Scopus (15719) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rushton, 1951 74. Rushton, W.A. A theory of the effects of fibre size in medullated nerve J. Physiol. 1951; 115 :101-122 Crossref Scopus (758) PubMed Google Scholar ): 𝑢 = 𝑐 ⁢ √ 𝑑 Here, u is the conduction velocity, d the axon diameter, and c a constant. We determined c using the average conduction velocity and average diameter of putative unmyelinated descending axons and assumed that this constant is the same for unmyelinated local axons of HVC (RA) neurons (i.e., that the basic biophysical properties underlying action potential propagation are the same). We then calculated a distribution of conduction velocities given the observed distribution of diameters of local axonal projections. To estimate the distribution of conduction times to synapses onto other HVC (RA) neurons, we used a Monte Carlo simulation approach. We stepped through all possible synapse locations along the set of reconstructed axon morphologies of HVC (RA) neurons. For each possible location, we calculated the distribution of conduction times to that location given the pathlength to the soma and the estimated distribution of local conduction velocities. We then randomly selected one of the possible conduction times and assigned it as a synapse onto other HVC (RA) neurons based on EM measurements of premotor synapse density for each location relative to the soma ( Kornfeld et al., 2017 43. Kornfeld, J. ∙ Benezra, S.E. ∙ Narayanan, R.T. ... EM connectomics reveals axonal target variation in a sequence-generating network eLife. 2017; 6 :e24364 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ). We ran 100 Monte Carlo simulations to obtain a robust estimate of the resulting conduction time distribution to other HVC (RA) neurons.
Synapse locations along HVC (RA) neuron axons for a given delay mean and SD were simulated as follows. Points along the reconstructed axon were grouped according to their pathlength distance to the soma into 50 μm bins. If successive points in the reconstruction had an interval of more than 1 μm, additional points were inserted at 0.5 μm intervals using linear interpolation (i.e., leaving the pathlength unchanged). Next, the log-normal delay distribution with given mean and SD was converted to a pathlength distribution by multiplication with the axonal conduction velocity of local HVC (RA) neuron axons (i.e., 0.187 mm/ms). For each neuron, we generated N Syn ∗ L Neuron / L Avg samples from this log-normal distribution. Here, N Syn = 170 is the average number of synapses made by each HVC (RA) neuron onto other premotor neurons ( Kornfeld et al., 2017 43. Kornfeld, J. ∙ Benezra, S.E. ∙ Narayanan, R.T. ... EM connectomics reveals axonal target variation in a sequence-generating network eLife. 2017; 6 :e24364 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ), L Neuron is the total axonal pathlength of this specific premotor neuron and L Avg is the average axonal pathlength across all 22 premotor neurons ( Benezra et al., 2018 7. Benezra, S.E. ∙ Narayanan, R.T. ∙ Egger, R. ... Morphological characterization of HVC projection neurons in the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) J. Comp. Neurol. 2018; 526 :1673-1689 Crossref Scopus (10) PubMed Google Scholar ). Samples beyond the maximum pathlength distance of an axon to the soma were repeated. A histogram of these pathlength samples with a bin width of 50 μm was computed. For each 50 μm bin, points along the reconstruction in the corresponding pathlength bin were randomly sampled until the number of elements in this bin of the histogram was reached and a synapse was placed at the location of the sampled points along the reconstruction. For comparison with calcium imaging data, simulated synapse locations were aligned by centering each reconstruction at the soma location, projecting onto the horizontal plane, and measuring their distance to the origin ( Figure 6 I).
Our ability to detect spatially localized patterns of sequentially active neurons ( Figures 6 A–6C) can be compromised by the presence of unconnected neurons that are active at a similar time by chance. To obtain an estimate of the fraction of active neurons that have to be connected in order to detect spatially localized patterns, we simulated the expected spatial distribution of a combination of connected and unconnected neurons. For each localized pattern of connected neurons ( Figures S6 A–S6C, top), we computed the spatial distribution of sequentially active neurons as described above. We refer to this distribution as ‘100% connected’ ( Figures S6 A–S6C, bottom). Next, we determined the possible locations of unconnected neurons by analyzing all pairs of sequentially active neurons that have a burst time difference of more than 20 ms (we refer to this distribution as ‘unconnected’). We then simulated the spatial distribution expected in the presence of X% connected and (100 – X)% unconnected neurons by sampling from these ‘100% connected’ and ‘unconnected’ distributions in the respective proportions and generating a combined distribution ( Figures S6 A–S6C, bottom). We used a two-sided two-sample KS-test to test whether this combined distribution was significantly different from the observed distribution (p values in Figures S6 A–S6C, bottom).
We reexamined two previously reported datasets ( Long et al., 2010 50. Long, M.A. ∙ Jin, D.Z. ∙ Fee, M.S. Support for a synaptic chain model of neuronal sequence generation Nature. 2010; 468 :394-399 Crossref Scopus (272) PubMed Google Scholar ; Vallentin and Long, 2015 83. Vallentin, D. ∙ Long, M.A. Motor origin of precise synaptic inputs onto forebrain neurons driving a skilled behavior J. Neurosci. 2015; 35 :299-307 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ) of intracellular recordings of HVC (RA) neurons during singing. For each neuron, we aligned burst onsets in different song motifs (defined as the peak of the 2 nd derivative of the membrane potential) and calculated the mean membrane potential ( Figure 4 ). We then fitted an exponential function a ∗ exp(b ∗ t) + c to the membrane potential in the time windows [-10, −5] ms and [-2, −0.1] ms before burst onset ( Figures 4 B and 4C) and defined the rise time as τ Rise = 1 / b. To determine the rise time in model HVC (RA) neurons, we simulated 50 trials in each network model, recorded the membrane potential at the soma in 1,000 randomly selected model neurons and determined burst onset times, average membrane potential and rise time for each neuron as described for intracellular recordings.
For each bird in the electrophysiology dataset, we determined all syllable lengths and number of bursts occurring during each syllable. In our modeling effort (see Figures 3 A and 3B), we simulated possible burst times by sampling random numbers distributed in time according to the burst density of the model, while preserving the distribution of syllable lengths from the experimental datasets and the number of bursts observed during each syllable. For each syllable, we then defined the power spectral density P s of the burst times as the absolute magnitude squared of the discrete Fourier transform evaluated at frequencies f between 1 and 200 Hz, in increments of 2 Hz: 𝑃 𝑠 ⁡ ( 𝑓 ) = ∣ ∑ 𝑛 𝑗 = 1 e x p ⁡ ( 2 ⁢ 𝜋 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑓 ⁢ 𝑡 𝑗 ) ∣ 2 Here, n is the number of bursts in the syllable, and t j the burst onset time of the j th burst. We then calculated the mean power spectrum across all syllables. In order to obtain a reliable estimate of the predicted power spectrum of each model and its uncertainty, we repeated this procedure 10,000 times. We determined the mean power (P mean ) in a window (±4 Hz) around the peak in the power spectrum between 75-200 Hz for each bootstrap simulation and P mean of the observed burst times. We calculated the percentile of the observed P mean relative to the distribution of simulated P mean values and defined this as the p value of the model power spectrum. We visually inspected all power spectra to ensure that the frequency corresponding to the intervals in synchronous network models – and not sub- or higher harmonics – was selected.
HVC (RA) neurons were modeled as a two-compartment model with a dendritic and somatic compartment ( Long et al., 2010 50. Long, M.A. ∙ Jin, D.Z. ∙ Fee, M.S. Support for a synaptic chain model of neuronal sequence generation Nature. 2010; 468 :394-399 Crossref Scopus (272) PubMed Google Scholar ). Current injection at the soma triggers sodium channel-dependent action potentials, while current injection (and synaptic input) to the dendrite compartment triggers an all-or-none calcium spike, which in turn triggers a high-frequency burst of four action potentials at the soma. Ion channels were modeled using the Hodgkin-Huxley formalism. All model parameters are identical to our previous work ( Long et al., 2010 50. Long, M.A. ∙ Jin, D.Z. ∙ Fee, M.S. Support for a synaptic chain model of neuronal sequence generation Nature. 2010; 468 :394-399 Crossref Scopus (272) PubMed Google Scholar ), except for the following adjustments made to match the rise time prior to burst onset with intracellular recordings during singing: R c = 130 MΩ, G s,L = 0.05 mS/cm 2 , τ c = 15 ms. Conductance-based excitatory synapses were modeled according to ‘kick-and-decay’ dynamics. Upon synaptic release, the synaptic conductance was increased by G syn , followed by an exponential decay with time constant τ syn = 5 ms. The weight G syn of individual synapses was drawn from a uniform distribution [0, G max ], with G max set to 0.05 mS/cm 2 , a value that leads to a unitary EPSP of ∼4 mV at the soma (i.e., the average EPSP amplitude is 2 mV) ( Mooney and Prather, 2005 57. Mooney, R. ∙ Prather, J.F. The HVC microcircuit: the synaptic basis for interactions between song motor and vocal plasticity pathways J. Neurosci. 2005; 25 :1952-1964 Crossref Scopus (128) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The feedforward HVC network model was assembled in an iterative process. The algorithm was designed to enforce synchrony of the synaptic inputs to the postsynaptic neurons. The timing of presynaptic bursts must be such that the spikes arrive at the postsynaptic neuron within a narrow time window (discussed below), considering the different burst transmission delays ( Figure 1 ). The number of connections that each neuron can receive was limited to 170, based on previous ultrastructural observations ( Kornfeld et al., 2017 43. Kornfeld, J. ∙ Benezra, S.E. ∙ Narayanan, R.T. ... EM connectomics reveals axonal target variation in a sequence-generating network eLife. 2017; 6 :e24364 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Each iteration consisted of three steps ( Figure S2 A): (i) simulation of network dynamics to determine the burst onset times of all neurons in the network at the current iteration; (ii) adding feedforward connections constrained by a given delay distribution between ‘source neurons’ (i.e., presynaptic neurons) and ‘target neurons’ (i.e., potential postsynaptic targets which do not form outgoing connections in the current iteration); (iii) adding additional neurons into the network. As a result, the feedforward network grows and the corresponding population sequence in duration during this iterative process ( Figure S2 B). In step (i) of each iteration, network dynamics were simulated by activating a set of 200 predefined ‘starter neurons’ and recording burst onset times of all active neurons in the network. In step (ii) , new feedforward synaptic connections between ‘source’ and ‘target neurons’ were added. First, N new neurons were moved from the set of ‘target neurons’ in the previous iteration to the set of ‘source neurons’. Specifically, these were the ‘target neurons’ whose simulated burst onset times were within a 2 ms window from the earliest simulated burst onset time of all ‘target neurons’ ( Figure S2 C). We then generated a ‘synaptic pool’ (i.e., a set of delays δ) of size N out ∗ N new (N out = 170) by sampling from the given distribution of delays. We iterated over all ‘target neurons’ ordered according to the number of synaptic inputs, starting with the smallest number. For each ‘target neuron’, we randomly selected a ‘source neuron’ that fulfilled the synchrony requirement | t target – τ int – δ – t source | ≤ τ sync using a suitable delay δ from the ‘synaptic pool’ ( Figure S2 C; i.e., requiring that all synaptic inputs to the ‘target neuron’ arrive within a synchronous time window 2 ∗ τ sync (here: time window of 1 ms). t source is the burst onset time of the ‘source neuron’, τ int is the average integration time constant of HVC (RA) neurons from onset of the synaptic inputs to burst threshold (∼5 ms) ( Long et al., 2010 50. Long, M.A. ∙ Jin, D.Z. ∙ Fee, M.S. Support for a synaptic chain model of neuronal sequence generation Nature. 2010; 468 :394-399 Crossref Scopus (272) PubMed Google Scholar ), and t target is the burst onset time of the ‘target neuron’. If there were multiple δ allowing a connection between the ‘source neuron’ and the ‘target neuron’, the one minimizing the quantity | t target – τ int – δ – t source | was selected (i.e., only one synapse was placed between a pair of ‘source’ and ‘target neurons’). After placement, this synaptic connection was removed from the ‘synaptic pool’. If the number of synaptic inputs to the ‘target neuron’ reached 170 or no connection from the ‘source neurons’ could be made given the delays in the ‘synaptic pool’, it was not considered as a ‘target neuron’ anymore. In step (iii) , neurons were added to the network in order to increase the network from the set of starter neurons to its final size. This step was taken in case there were no more ‘target neurons’ before the ‘synaptic pool’ was exhausted. In this case, the set of ‘target neurons’ was restored to its state at the beginning of the iteration. A new ‘target neuron’ (i.e., without any existing incoming or outgoing synaptic connections) was added to the network by placing a synaptic connection with a randomly selected delay δ from the ‘synaptic pool’ originating from one of the N new ‘source neurons’ added to the network in this iteration. The putative burst onset time of the new ‘target neuron’ was defined as: t new = t source + δ + τ int . All other synaptic connections placed in this iteration were removed from the network; the associated delays were moved back into the ‘synaptic pool’; and steps (ii) and (iii) were repeated until the ‘synaptic pool’ was empty. Then, the next iteration was started, and this process repeated until all 20,000 HVC (RA) neurons were incorporated into the network. To investigate the effect of the statistics of delays on sequence generation, we used different delay distributions during network assembly. The delay distributions in the completely assembled networks matched the target distributions ( Figure S2 D).
To generate network models using postsynaptic delays ( Figure 4 ), we set all delays δ equal to zero and the synchronous time window during which inputs could arrive to individual neurons (2 ∗ τ sync ) to 8 ms. Integration times of postsynaptic neurons were controlled by varying the membrane capacitance of the dendritic compartment. Heterogeneity in the population was created by drawing the membrane capacitance for individual neurons from a log-normal distribution truncated below at 1 μF/cm 2 . Parameters of the log-normal distribution were determined such that at a minimum standard deviation the mean membrane potential rise times matched intracellular recordings. Then the SD of the log-normal distribution was increased while keeping the other parameters fixed ( Figure 4 D).
To generate network models with different degrees of feedforward (FF) and recurrent synaptic connections, we used a network model with delays similar to those observed in HVC ( Figure 5 F). A fraction of synapses from each neuron was randomly selected to remain as FF synapses and the remaining synapses were connected to other randomly selected neurons in the network model.
During simulations, HVC (RA) neurons received additional independent white noise input currents to their somatic and dendritic compartments with zero mean and amplitudes A soma = 0.1nA and A dendrite = 0.2nA, leading to fluctuations of the somatic membrane potential with a standard deviation of 4.2 mV ( Long et al., 2010 50. Long, M.A. ∙ Jin, D.Z. ∙ Fee, M.S. Support for a synaptic chain model of neuronal sequence generation Nature. 2010; 468 :394-399 Crossref Scopus (272) PubMed Google Scholar ). To account for the white noise currents, the HVC (RA) neuron models were treated as a system of stochastic differential equations and solved using the AN3D1 weak 3 rd order method ( Debrabant, 2010 17. Debrabant, K. Runge-Kutta methods for third order weak approximation of SDEs with multidimensional additive noise BIT. 2010; 50 :541-558 Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar ). The simulation time step was set to 0.01 ms.
Each simulation was started by activating the set of 200 ‘starter neurons’ using an excitatory conductance kick with amplitude 300 nS exponential decay with time constant 5 ms (i.e., simulating synchronous synaptic input). This input was delivered to the ‘starter neurons’ either synchronously, uniformly distributed over a 7 ms window, or randomly within a 10 ms window. In order to minimize transient effects of this activation procedure, the first 50 ms of simulated activity were discarded. Network activity patterns after this transient period were qualitatively similar between the different activation procedures. To generate burst densities, we ran 50 simulations, recorded the burst onset time of each neuron (i.e., the time where the membrane potential at the soma crosses 0 mV for the first time during a burst) and calculated the average number of bursts in 0.75 ms bins.
All statistical details of experiments can be found in figure legends and the Results section, including the statistical tests used, exact value of n and what n represents (e.g., number of animals, number of cells, etc.). Values are reported as mean ± SD unless mentioned otherwise, and values are plotted as mean with error bars representing SD unless mentioned otherwise. Significance was defined at a level of 0.05. Normal distribution of data was not assumed. No data were excluded from analysis. Statistical calculations were performed using MATLAB R2016a.
