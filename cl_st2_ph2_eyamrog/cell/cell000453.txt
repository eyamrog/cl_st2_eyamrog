Title: Targeting Pin1 renders pancreatic cancer eradicable by synergizing with immunochemotherapy


Abstract: Summary

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by notorious resistance to current therapies attributed to inherent tumor heterogeneity and highly desmoplastic and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Unique proline isomerase Pin1 regulates multiple cancer pathways, but its role in the TME and cancer immunotherapy is unknown. Here, we find that Pin1 is overexpressed both in cancer cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and correlates with poor survival in PDAC patients. Targeting Pin1 using clinically available drugs induces complete elimination or sustained remissions of aggressive PDAC by synergizing with anti-PD-1 and gemcitabine in diverse model systems. Mechanistically, Pin1 drives the desmoplastic and immunosuppressive TME by acting on CAFs and induces lysosomal degradation of the PD-1 ligand PD-L1 and the gemcitabine transporter ENT1 in cancer cells, besides activating multiple cancer pathways. Thus, Pin1 inhibition simultaneously blocks multiple cancer pathways, disrupts the desmoplastic and immunosuppressive TME, and upregulates PD-L1 and ENT1, rendering PDAC eradicable by immunochemotherapy.

Section: Introduction

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most aggressive solid malignancies, with near uniform mortality ( Siegel et al., 2021 88. Siegel, R.L. ∙ Miller, K.D. ∙ Fuchs, H.E. ... Cancer Statistics, 2021 CA Cancer J. Clin. 2021; 71 :7-33 Crossref Scopus (1547) PubMed Google Scholar ), and is projected to be the 2 nd leading cause of cancer deaths by 2030 ( Rahib et al., 2014 78. Rahib, L. ∙ Smith, B.D. ∙ Aizenberg, R. ... Projecting cancer incidence and deaths to 2030: the unexpected burden of thyroid, liver, and pancreas cancers in the United States Cancer Res. 2014; 74 :2913-2921 Crossref Scopus (3350) PubMed Google Scholar ). PDAC is notoriously resistant to chemotherapy, targeted therapies, and even immunotherapy ( Brahmer et al., 2012 12. Brahmer, J.R. ∙ Tykodi, S.S. ∙ Chow, L.Q. ...

Tumor heterogeneity renders tumors resistant to targeted therapies aiming at blocking individual pathways because multiple pathways are often activated simultaneously and/or rapidly upregulated as a compensatory mechanism ( Gerlinger et al., 2012 30.

The PDAC TME is dominated by dense desmoplasia and immunosuppressive cell populations, which limit cytotoxic T cell response ( Balachandran et al., 2019 4. Balachandran, V.P. ∙ Beatty, G.L. ∙ Dougan, S.K.

Med. 2016; 22 :497-505 Crossref Scopus (287) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play a central role in promoting the desmoplastic and immunosuppressive TME by producing extracellular matrix proteins and cytokines, as well as interacting with cancer cells to promote tumor growth and malignancy ( Sahai et al., 2020 83. Sahai, E. ∙ Astsaturov, I. ∙ Cukierman, E. ... A framework for advancing our understanding of cancer-associated fibroblasts Nat. Rev.

Recent strategies targeting the stroma reduce tumor growth and increase tumor response to chemo- and/or immunotherapy; however, they rarely lead to obvious tumor regression ( Jiang et al., 2016 45.

Moreover, some of those approaches even lead to disease acceleration and more aggressive tumors ( Özdemir et al., 2014 75. Özdemir, B.C. ∙ Pentcheva-Hoang, T. ∙ Carstens, J.L. ...

Oncol. 2020; 17 :527-540 Crossref Scopus (106) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hosein et al., 2020 41. Hosein, A.N. ∙ Brekken, R.A. ∙ Maitra, A.

Cancer. 2020; 20 :174-186 Crossref Scopus (485) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting that targeting the TME might not be sufficient.
Targeting immune checkpoints such as the one mediated by programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and its ligand PD-L1 has improved patient survival in various cancers. However, the response rate is very low in PDAC patients ( Brahmer et al., 2012 12. Brahmer, J.R. ∙ Tykodi, S.S. ∙ Chow, L.Q. ... Safety and activity of anti-PD-L1 antibody in patients with advanced cancer N. Engl. J. Med. 2012; 366 :2455-2465 Crossref Scopus (5190) PubMed Google Scholar ), due to diminished tumor immunogenicity, including low PD-L1 expression and immunosuppressive TME, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood ( Gotwals et al., 2017 34.

PD-L1 expression is tightly controlled at the transcriptional and post-translational levels but is aberrantly altered in human cancers ( Burr et al., 2017 13.

Cyclin D-CDK4 kinase destabilizes PD-L1 via cullin 3-SPOP to control cancer immune surveillance Nature. 2018; 553 :91-95 Crossref Scopus (306) PubMed Google Scholar ). Importantly, although PD-L1 has been well studied for its engagement with PD-1 on T cells to evade antitumor immunity, recent studies have shown that the presence of PD-L1-expressing cancer cells within tumors is known to be an important predictor of response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy in patients ( Herbst et al., 2014 37.

Predictive correlates of response to the anti-PD-L1 antibody MPDL3280A in cancer patients Nature. 2014; 515 :563-567 Crossref Scopus (3140) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, upregulating PD-L1 expression in cancer cells using different approaches improves ICB efficacy in experimental models ( Herter-Sprie et al., 2016 38. Herter-Sprie, G.S. ∙ Koyama, S. ∙ Korideck, H. ...

Cyclin D-CDK4 kinase destabilizes PD-L1 via cullin 3-SPOP to control cancer immune surveillance Nature. 2018; 553 :91-95 Crossref Scopus (306) PubMed Google Scholar ). Since most PDAC tumors are negative for PD-L1 ( Tessier-Cloutier et al., 2017 90. Tessier-Cloutier, B. ∙ Kalloger, S.E. ∙ Al-Kandari, M. ... Programmed cell death ligand 1 cut-point is associated with reduced disease specific survival in resected pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma BMC Cancer. 2017; 17 :618 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ), it is critical to understand the mechanisms and signaling pathways behind the regulation of PD-L1 levels to improve ICB response and efficacy.
A central common signaling mechanism in cancer is proline-directed phosphorylation regulating numerous oncoproteins and tumor suppressors ( Blume-Jensen and Hunter, 2001 11. Blume-Jensen, P. ∙ Hunter, T. Oncogenic kinase signalling Nature. 2001; 411 :355-365 Crossref Scopus (2995) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ubersax and Ferrell, 2007 91. Ubersax, J.A. ∙ Ferrell, Jr., J.E. Mechanisms of specificity in protein phosphorylation Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8 :530-541 Crossref Scopus (893) PubMed Google Scholar ), many of which are further regulated by a unique proline isomerase, Pin1 ( Lu and Hunter, 2014 61. Lu, Z. ∙ Hunter, T. Prolyl isomerase Pin1 in cancer Cell Res. 2014; 24 :1033-1049 Crossref Scopus (112) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhou and Lu, 2016 103. Zhou, X.Z. ∙ Lu, K.P. The isomerase PIN1 controls numerous cancer-driving pathways and is a unique drug target Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2016; 16 :463-478 Crossref Scopus (127) PubMed Google Scholar ). Aberrant Pin1 overactivation promotes tumorigenesis by activating over 60 oncoproteins and inactivating over 30 tumor suppressors in various cancers, including numerous substrates in oncogenic Kras signaling ( Lu and Hunter, 2014 61. Lu, Z. ∙ Hunter, T. Prolyl isomerase Pin1 in cancer Cell Res. 2014; 24 :1033-1049 Crossref Scopus (112) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhou and Lu, 2016 103. Zhou, X.Z. ∙ Lu, K.P. The isomerase PIN1 controls numerous cancer-driving pathways and is a unique drug target Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2016; 16 :463-478 Crossref Scopus (127) PubMed Google Scholar ), which is dominant in PDAC ( Waters and Der, 2018 95. Waters, A.M. ∙ Der, C.J. KRAS: The Critical Driver and Therapeutic Target for Pancreatic Cancer Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Med. 2018; 8 :a031435 Crossref Scopus (218) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, PIN1 −/− mice develop normally but are highly resistant to tumorigenesis ( Girardini et al., 2011 32. Girardini, J.E. ∙ Napoli, M. ∙ Piazza, S. ...

Moreover, genetic polymorphisms that reduce Pin1 expression are also associated with reduced risk for multiple cancers in humans ( Li et al., 2013 55. Li, Q. ∙ Dong, Z. ∙ Lin, Y. ... The rs2233678 polymorphism in PIN1 promoter region reduced cancer risk: a meta-analysis PLoS ONE. 2013; 8 :e68148 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ). These data suggest that targeting Pin1 in PDAC might simultaneously block multiple oncogenic signaling pathways without major toxicity ( Lu and Hunter, 2014 61. Lu, Z. ∙ Hunter, T. Prolyl isomerase Pin1 in cancer Cell Res. 2014; 24 :1033-1049 Crossref Scopus (112) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhou and Lu, 2016 103. Zhou, X.Z. ∙ Lu, K.P. The isomerase PIN1 controls numerous cancer-driving pathways and is a unique drug target Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2016; 16 :463-478 Crossref Scopus (127) PubMed Google Scholar ). This notion has been corroborated by the recent unexpected identification of all- trans retinoic acid and arsenic trioxide (ATRA + ATO) as synergistic Pin1 inhibitors that block multiple cancer-driving pathways, eliminate cancer stem cells, and increase response to chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and radiation in various cancers ( Kozono et al., 2018 52.

The isomerase PIN1 controls numerous cancer-driving pathways and is a unique drug target Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2016; 16 :463-478 Crossref Scopus (127) PubMed Google Scholar ). These findings identify Pin1 as a major cellular target for ATRA + ATO to safely cure deadly acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) ( de Thé and Chen, 2010 18. de Thé, H. ∙ Chen, Z.

The isomerase PIN1 controls numerous cancer-driving pathways and is a unique drug target Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2016; 16 :463-478 Crossref Scopus (127) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, it is unknown whether Pin1 has any role in the TME and cancer immunotherapy and whether Pin1 inhibitors could render a solid malignancy curable.
Here, we report that in PDAC, Pin1 drives the desmoplastic and immunosuppressive TME by acting on CAFs and induces PD-L1 and ENT1 endocytosis and lysosomal degradation in cancer cells by acting on HIP1R, in addition to activating multiple oncogenic pathways. Consequently, targeting Pin1 using Pin1 inhibitors including ATRA + ATO simultaneously blocks multiple cancer pathways, disrupts the desmoplastic and immunosuppressive TME, and upregulates PD-L1 and ENT1, thereby rendering aggressive PDAC eradicable by synergizing with immunochemotherapy. These findings may have immediate therapeutic impact on PDAC patients as some Pin1 inhibitors are approved drugs.

Section: Results

To evaluate the effects of targeting Pin1 on the TME and tumor growth in PDAC, we used two different Pin1 inhibitors (Pin1i-1 and -2) to treat three different PDAC mouse models. Pin1i-1 is a combination of ATRA + ATO ( Kozono et al., 2018 52. Kozono, S. ∙ Lin, Y.M. ∙ Seo, H.S. ... Arsenic targets Pin1 and cooperates with retinoic acid to inhibit cancer-driving pathways and tumor-initiating cells Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :3069 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ), and Pin1i-2 is Sulfopin, a highly Pin1-specific covalent inhibitor that targets the ATO-binding pocket and has no detectable side effect ( Dubiella et al., 2021 22. Dubiella, C. ∙ Pinch, B.J. ∙ Koikawa, K. ... Sulfopin is a covalent inhibitor of Pin1 that blocks Myc-driven tumors in vivo Nat. Chem. Biol. 2021; Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Tables S1 and S2 ). The three mouse models were patient-derived tumor orthotopic xenograft (PDTX) model ( Day et al., 2015 17.

J. 2019; 17 :498-506 Crossref Scopus (6) PubMed Google Scholar ). Treatment of overt tumor (>0.5 cm)-bearing PDTX or GDA mice with Pin1i-1 or -2 significantly reduced tumor growth ( Figures S1 A–S1C and S2 B), collagen deposition ( Figures 1 A and S1 D), and CAF activation and proliferation ( Figures 1 B, S1 F, S1G, and S1J). Compared with vehicle controls, Pin1 inhibitors reduced the proliferation of cancer cells ( Figure S1 E) and resulted in a more differentiated histology ( Figures S1 D and S1I), as evidenced by reduced vimentin and increased E-cadherin, markers for epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) ( Figure S1 H). Both Pin1 inhibitors also increased tumor-infiltrating CD8α + T cells, specifically CD8α + Granzyme B + cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) and decreased immunosuppressive CD4 + FOXP3 + regulatory T cells (Tregs), Ly6G + CD11b + myeloid cells, and F4/80 + CD206 + tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) in GDA mice ( Figures 1 C and S2 D–S2G). Thus, Pin1 inhibitors suppress tumor growth and progression and block CAF activation, as well as disrupt the desmoplastic and immunosuppressive TME in PDAC mouse models.
The above results suggest that Pin1 inhibitors might increase PDAC responses to chemo- and/or immunotherapy. Thus, we first treated overt tumor-bearing PDTX, PDOX or GDA mice with Pin1i and/or low dose (20 mg/kg, weekly) gemcitabine (GEM), with or without starting Pin1i treatment 3 days before starting GEM ( Figure S1 A). Pin1i-1 or -2 were only slightly superior to GEM treatment in inhibiting tumor growth and improving survival, but the effects were significantly enhanced by their combination in each of mouse models assessed ( Figures S1 K–S1M and S2 A). The combination effects were even more profound in a group of tumor-bearing mice with Pin1i treatment started at 3 days before GEM ( Figure S1 K). This prompted us to routinely start a Pin1i treatment at 3 days before others in combination therapies. In addition, unlike GEM treatment alone, Pin1i also fully prevented liver metastasis of PDAC in PDTX mice ( Figure S1 N).
Next, we treated tumor-bearing GDA mice with Pin1i, and/or anti-PD-1 (αPD1), or low-dose (10 mg/kg, weekly) GEM + αPD1 (G+P) ( Figure S1 A). Treatment with αPD1 or G+P partially inhibited tumor growth and marginally increased overall survival ( Jiang et al., 2016 45. Jiang, H. ∙ Hegde, S. ∙ Knolhoff, B.L. ... Targeting focal adhesion kinase renders pancreatic cancers responsive to checkpoint immunotherapy Nat. Med. 2016; 22 :851-860 Crossref Scopus (444) PubMed Google Scholar ), and both Pin1i-1 and -2 as single agents were slightly more potent than above treatments ( Figures 1 D, 1E, S2 B, and S2I). Notably, Pin1i-1 + αPD1 combination dramatically reduced tumor growth and more than doubled median survival, with 12.5% complete regression ( Figure 1 E). The most pronounced effect was seen in a group treated with the triple combination. Pin1i-1 and G+P combination markedly disrupted the desmoplastic and immunosuppressive TME ( Figures S2 C, S2F, and S2G) and fundamentally changed overall survival, leading to 87.5% complete regression ( Figures 1 D and 1E). These mice survived without macroscopic ( Figure 1 F) or microscopic ( Figure 1 G) evidence for residual PDAC at least for 1 year in good health, even though the treatments were stopped at 120 days ( Figures 1 E and S2 H). Similar results were obtained with Pin1i-2 in combination with αPD1 or G+P, although they were less impressive during long-term treatment ( Figures S2 B, S2C, S2E, S2F, S2H, and S2I).
To examine the relevance of cytotoxic and natural killer cells for the synergy between Pin1 inhibition and immunotherapy, we examined the efficacy of Pin1i-2 and αPD1 combination in the absence or presence of CD8α + T cells or NK1.1 + cells in GDA mice. When CD8α + T cells were depleted, PDAC tumor growth accelerated considerably and the synergistic efficacy of Pin1i-2 and αPD1 treatment was completely offset ( Figure 1 H). αPD1 treatment alone also accelerated tumor growth in CD8α + T cell depleted GDA mice ( Figure S2 J), reminiscent of hyper-progression observed in clinical trials of cancer patients with αPD1 therapy ( Wang et al., 2020 94. Wang, X. ∙ Wang, F. ∙ Zhong, M. ... The biomarkers of hyperprogressive disease in PD-1/PD-L1 blockage therapy Mol. Cancer. 2020; 19 :81 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ). Immune cell profiling showed that while Pin1i increased the number of tumor-infiltrating CD8α + T cells and their Granzyme B expression, Pin1i alone also increased their expression of the activation/exhaustion markers, PD-1, lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG-3), and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4), but the later effects tended to be reduced by combination with αPD1 ( Figures S2 E and S2G), indicative of reversion of lymphocyte exhaustion ( Ruscetti et al., 2020 82. Ruscetti, M. ∙ Morris, 4th, J.P. ∙ Mezzadra, R. ... Senescence-Induced Vascular Remodeling Creates Therapeutic Vulnerabilities in Pancreas Cancer Cell. 2020; 181 :424-441 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast, PD-L1 expression on myeloid and dendritic cells (DCs), which contribute to anti-tumor immune response ( Oh et al., 2021 73. Oh, S.A. ∙ Wu, D.C. ∙ Cheung, J. ... PD-L1 expression by dendritic cells is a key regulator of T-cell immunity in cancer Nat. Can. 2021; 1 :681-691 Crossref Google Scholar ), was not changed after Pin1 inhibition ( Figure S2 E). Thus, CD8 + CTLs are pivotal for the synergy between Pin1 inhibition and immunotherapy.
To investigate whether the synergy of immunochemotherapy with Pin1 inhibition in PDAC is specific to GEM or αPD1, we tested the microtubule stabilizing paclitaxel (PTX), non-nucleoside-based chemotherapy, and anti-CTLA-4 (αCTLA4), an alternative ICB. Pin1 inhibition did not potentiate PTX anti-tumor activity and tended to increase αCTLA4 anti-tumor effect, but the effect was small and without statistical significance ( Figure S2 K). Thus, although Pin1 inhibitors have moderate single-agent anticancer efficacy, they potently disrupt the desmoplastic and immunosuppressive TME, and remarkably render most aggressive PDAC tumors curable when combined with GEM and αPD1 in GDA mice.
Given such unexpected and striking potency of Pin1i in rendering PDAC curable, we evaluated Pin1 expression in human tumor tissues surgically resected from 167 PDAC patients and its relationships with TME changes and patient survival using IHC with a validated Pin1 monoclonal antibody ( Bao et al., 2004 5. Bao, L. ∙ Kimzey, A. ∙ Sauter, G. ... Prevalent overexpression of prolyl isomerase Pin1 in human cancers Am. J. Pathol. 2004; 164 :1727-1737 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). Pin1 was overexpressed in cancer cells and correlated positively with cancer progression ( Figures 2 A and S3 A). Furthermore, Pin1 was overexpressed in tumor stromal CAFs, which expressed various CAF markers, α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA), fibroblast activation protein (FAP), human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II histocompatibility antigen DP beta 1 (HLA-DPB1), or CD44 ( Figures 2 B–2D, and S3 B) ( Hosein et al., 2020 41. Hosein, A.N. ∙ Brekken, R.A. ∙ Maitra, A. Pancreatic cancer stroma: an update on therapeutic targeting strategies Nat. Rev. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2020; 17 :487-505 Crossref Scopus (93) PubMed Google Scholar ). By classifying our cohorts into Pin1-High and Pin1-Low groups based on their IHC intensity and area, we not only found that Pin1 was overexpressed in cancer cells in 71.5% of the patients and correlated with poor survival, as reported ( Chen et al., 2019 15. Chen, L. ∙ Xu, X. ∙ Wen, X. ... Targeting PIN1 exerts potent antitumor activity in pancreatic ductal carcinoma via inhibiting tumor metastasis Cancer Sci. 2019; 110 :2442-2455 Crossref Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ), but also uncovered that Pin1 was overexpressed in CAFs in 51.9% of the patients and correlated with poor survival ( Figure 2 E). More impressively, high Pin1 both in cancer cells and CAFs, as compared with low Pin1 group, strongly correlated with reduced median overall survival from 60 to 16 months in this cohort ( Figure 2 F). To ask whether Pin1 overexpression is relevant to the desmoplastic and immunosuppressive TME, we evaluated collagen deposition and tumor-infiltrating immune cell populations in human PDAC tissues. Pin1 overexpression in CAFs, but not in cancer cells, significantly correlated with collagen deposition ( Figure 2 G). Pin1 overexpression in cancer cells and CAFs also correlated with fewer infiltrated CD8 + T cells and more CD163 + TAMs ( Figures 2 H and 2I). Thus, Pin1 is overexpressed in cancer cells and CAFs in human PDAC and correlates well with the desmoplastic and immunosuppressive TME and poor survival.
To determine the functional significance of Pin1 overexpression in CAFs in human PDAC tumors, we derived primary CAFs from two different PDAC patients ( Koikawa et al., 2018a 49. Koikawa, K. ∙ Ohuchida, K. ∙ Ando, Y. ... Basement membrane destruction by pancreatic stellate cells leads to local invasion in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma Cancer Lett. 2018; 425 :65-77 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar , 2018b 50.

Pancreatic stellate cells reorganize matrix components and lead pancreatic cancer invasion via the function of Endo180 Cancer Lett. 2018; 412 :143-154 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) and inhibited their Pin1 function using Pin1i, genetic knockdown (KD) or CRISPR knockout (KO). Both Pin1 inhibitors dose-dependently reduced Pin1 and its many substrate oncoproteins in CAFs ( Figures 3 A and S3 C), with ATRA and ATO synergistically targeting and degrading Pin1, as shown ( Kozono et al., 2018 52. Kozono, S. ∙ Lin, Y.M. ∙ Seo, H.S. ... Arsenic targets Pin1 and cooperates with retinoic acid to inhibit cancer-driving pathways and tumor-initiating cells Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :3069 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wei et al., 2015 96. Wei, S. ∙ Kozono, S. ∙ Kats, L. ... Active Pin1 is a key target of all-trans retinoic acid in acute promyelocytic leukemia and breast cancer Nat. Med. 2015; 21 :457-466 Crossref Scopus (172) PubMed Google Scholar ). We demonstrated that Pin1 inhibition suppressed CAF proliferation ( Figures 3 B, S3 D, and S3E), induced CAF quiescent phenotype, and inhibited their ability to secrete a wide range of cytokines ( Figures 3 C–3E and S3 F). Notably, we found suppression of IL-6 and TGF-β release by cancer cells and IL-6, TGF-β, LIF, and CXCL12 secretion by CAFs in response to Pin1 inhibition ( Figures S3 G and S3H). Those factors promote cancer cell progression ( Erkan et al., 2012 25. Erkan, M. ∙ Adler, G. ∙ Apte, M.V. ... StellaTUM: current consensus and discussion on pancreatic stellate cell research Gut. 2012; 61 :172-178 Crossref Scopus (270) PubMed Google Scholar ; Shi et al., 2019 87.

Targeting LIF-mediated paracrine interaction for pancreatic cancer therapy and monitoring Nature. 2019; 569 :131-135 Crossref Scopus (112) PubMed Google Scholar ), prevent T cell recruitment into the TME ( Garg et al., 2018 29.

Mace, T.A. ∙ Shakya, R. ∙ Pitarresi, J.R. ... IL-6 and PD-L1 antibody blockade combination therapy reduces tumour progression in murine models of pancreatic cancer Gut. 2018; 67 :320-332 Crossref Scopus (212) PubMed Google Scholar ), and suppress response to anti-PD-L1 (αPDL1) ( Feig et al., 2013 27. Feig, C. ∙ Jones, J.O. ∙ Kraman, M. ... Targeting CXCL12 from FAP-expressing carcinoma-associated fibroblasts synergizes with anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy in pancreatic cancer Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

TGFβ attenuates tumour response to PD-L1 blockade by contributing to exclusion of T cells Nature. 2018; 554 :544-548 Crossref Scopus (1236) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, Pin1 activates CAFs and may contribute to the desmoplastic and immunosuppressive TME.
A continuous crosstalk between cancer cells and CAFs enhances tumor growth and invasion ( Erkan et al., 2012 25. Erkan, M. ∙ Adler, G. ∙ Apte, M.V. ... StellaTUM: current consensus and discussion on pancreatic stellate cell research Gut. 2012; 61 :172-178 Crossref Scopus (270) PubMed Google Scholar ). To address whether Pin1 inhibition in CAFs affects their ability to act on cancer cells, we first indirectly co-cultured pre-formed human PDAC organoids with CAFs to analyze the effects of CAF-derived humoral factors on PDAC organoid growth and invasion ( Figure 3 F). Unlike control CAFs, which promoted PDAC organoid growth and invasion, Pin1 KD CAFs failed to promote PDAC organoid growth and invasion similar to the level of those without added CAFs ( Figures 3 G and 3H). To analyze the effects of cell-cell interactions, we then directly co-cultured PDAC organoids with Pin1i-treated or KO CAFs, followed by assaying organoid growth and invasion using time-lapse imaging ( Koikawa et al., 2018a 49. Koikawa, K. ∙ Ohuchida, K. ∙ Ando, Y. ... Basement membrane destruction by pancreatic stellate cells leads to local invasion in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma Cancer Lett. 2018; 425 :65-77 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S3 I). The results further confirmed that control CAFs, but neither Pin1i-treated nor Pin1 KO CAFs, promoted PDAC organoid growth and invasion ( Figures S3 J and S3K; Video S1 ). Finally, to examine whether Pin1 is important for CAFs to promote the TME and tumor growth of PDAC in vivo , we orthotopically co-transplanted human PDAC organoids with Pin1 KO or control CAFs into the mouse pancreas (PDOX model). In contrast to control CAFs, Pin1 KO CAFs completely failed to promote tumor fibrosis, cancer cell proliferation, and tumor growth and progression, similar to those without co-transplanted CAFs ( Figures 3 I, 3J, S3 L, and S3M). Thus, Pin1 in CAFs is necessary to promote the pro-tumorigenic TME and enhance the growth and malignant phenotype of PDAC in human organoids and mouse tumors.

Pin1-inhibited or CRISPR KO CAFs fail to promote PDAC growth and invasion in human 3D PDAC organoid direct co-cultures, related to Figure S3 Pin1i-treated CAF1 (Pin1i1 10 μM or Pin1i-2 5 μM for 72 hr), or Pin KO CAF1 or control CAF1, labeled in red using cell tracker red, were co-cultured with established PDAC1 organoids, labeled by GFP (green), followed by live-cell time-lapse movies to visualize their interactions and analyze organoid growth and invasion.
The above results show that targeting Pin1 disrupts the TME and renders PDAC tumors curable by immunochemotherapy, but the previous attempts to target stroma cells in PDAC were only modestly effective ( Ho et al., 2020 40. Ho, W.J. ∙ Jaffee, E.M. ∙ Zheng, L. The tumour microenvironment in pancreatic cancer - clinical challenges and opportunities Nat. Rev. Clin. Oncol. 2020; 17 :527-540 Crossref Scopus (106) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sahai et al., 2020 83. Sahai, E. ∙ Astsaturov, I. ∙ Cukierman, E. ... A framework for advancing our understanding of cancer-associated fibroblasts Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2020; 20 :174-186 Crossref Scopus (485) PubMed Google Scholar ; Whittle and Hingorani, 2019 97. Whittle, M.C. ∙ Hingorani, S.R. Fibroblasts in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma: Biological Mechanisms and Therapeutic Targets Gastroenterology. 2019; 156 :2085-2096 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ). We reasoned that Pin1 inhibitors might also act on cancer cells, given its overexpression in cancer cells ( Figures 2 A–2D). Thus, we examined the effects of Pin1i, Pin1 KD or KO in primary PDAC cells and organoids derived from two different PDAC patients ( Koikawa et al., 2018a 49. Koikawa, K. ∙ Ohuchida, K. ∙ Ando, Y. ... Basement membrane destruction by pancreatic stellate cells leads to local invasion in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma Cancer Lett. 2018; 425 :65-77 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, like Pin1 KD or KO, both Pin1 inhibitors dose-dependently reduced Pin1 and its substrate oncoproteins including those in Kras signaling ( Figures S4 A–S4C and S4E), as well as PDAC cell proliferation ( Figures S4 D, S4F, and S4G), but the effects were largely abolished by Pin1 KO ( Figure S4 H), confirming their specificity. Furthermore, like Pin1 KD, both Pin1 inhibitors also reduced human PDAC organoid growth and enhanced the ability of GEM to inhibit organoid growth and proliferation ( Figures S4 I–S4L). Moreover, when human PDAC organoids were pre-treated with Pin1i-1 or -2, followed by treatment with GEM, both Pin1 inhibitors greatly potentiated GEM-mediated organoid apoptosis, whereas neither Pin1i nor GEM alone had obvious effect ( Figures 4 A and 4B).
Given the striking ability of Pin1 inhibitor pretreatment to potentiate the GEM sensitivity of PDAC cells, we reasoned that Pin1 inhibitors might affect the expression of some determinants of the GEM sensitivity. Notably, equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (ENT1) is required for GEM uptake and is a therapeutic response marker for GEM, deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) is involved in the first phosphorylation cascade in GEM activation, and ribonucleotide reductase subunit 1 (RRM1) is a main nuclear target for GEM ( Amrutkar and Gladhaug, 2017 1. Amrutkar, M. ∙ Gladhaug, I.P. Pancreatic Cancer Chemoresistance to Gemcitabine Cancers (Basel). 2017; 9 :157 Crossref Scopus (171) PubMed Google Scholar ; Farrell et al., 2009 26. Farrell, J.J. ∙ Elsaleh, H. ∙ Garcia, M. ... Human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 levels predict response to gemcitabine in patients with pancreatic cancer Gastroenterology. 2009; 136 :187-195 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (339) PubMed Google Scholar ). Both Pin1 inhibitors dose-dependently increased the levels of ENT1, but neither dCK nor RRM1 was affected ( Figure 4 C). Since Pin1 inhibition potently enhanced αPD1 efficacy against PDAC ( Figure 1 E), we hypothesized that Pin1 inhibitors might also affect the expression of ICB response biomarkers, whose upregulation increases ICB efficacy such as PD-L1 ( Jiao et al., 2017 46. Jiao, S. ∙ Xia, W. ∙ Yamaguchi, H. ... PARP Inhibitor Upregulates PD-L1 Expression and Enhances Cancer-Associated Immunosuppression Clin. Cancer Res. 2017; 23 :3711-3720 Crossref Scopus (372) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhang et al., 2018 102. Zhang, J. ∙ Bu, X. ∙ Wang, H. ... Cyclin D-CDK4 kinase destabilizes PD-L1 via cullin 3-SPOP to control cancer immune surveillance Nature. 2018; 553 :91-95 Crossref Scopus (306) PubMed Google Scholar ) and HLA class 1 ( McGranahan et al., 2017 69. McGranahan, N. ∙ Rosenthal, R. ∙ Hiley, C.T. ..., TRACERx Consortium Allele-Specific HLA Loss and Immune Escape in Lung Cancer Evolution Cell. 2017; 171 :1259-1271 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (439) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yamamoto et al., 2020 101. Yamamoto, K. ∙ Venida, A. ∙ Yano, J. ... Autophagy promotes immune evasion of pancreatic cancer by degrading MHC-I Nature. 2020; 581 :100-105 Crossref Scopus (178) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, both Pin1 inhibitors dose-dependently upregulated PD-L1 but not HLA class 1 level ( Figure 4 C). The upregulation of PD-L1 and ENT1 was also confirmed by Pin1 KD or KO ( Figure 4 D) and was notable on the cell surface of Pin1i-treated PDAC cells in vitro ( Figures 4 E and 4F) and Pin1i-treated PDTXs and GDAs in mice ( Figures 4 G–4J, S5 A, and S5B). Moreover, Pin1 expression inversely correlated with that of PD-L1 and ENT1 in human PDAC tissues ( Figures S5 C–S5E). Thus, Pin1 inhibition not only blocks multiple cancer pathways but also induces PD-L1 and ENT1 expression on the surface of PDAC cells in vitro and in vivo .
Our findings that Pin1 inhibition in PDAC cells increased PD-L1 and ENT1 protein levels ( Figures 4 C–4F) but decreased their mRNA levels ( Figure S5 F) suggest that Pin1 inhibition might stabilize ENT1 and PD-L1 proteins.

Hu, Q. ∙ Qin, Y. ∙ Zhang, B. ... FBW7 increases the chemosensitivity of pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine through upregulation of ENT1 Oncol. Rep. 2017; 38 :2069-2077 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ) is highly regulated, and to modulate proteolysis is a dominant mechanism for Pin1 to regulate dozens of oncogenic proteins ( Zhou and Lu, 2016 103. Zhou, X.Z. ∙ Lu, K.P. The isomerase PIN1 controls numerous cancer-driving pathways and is a unique drug target Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2016; 16 :463-478 Crossref Scopus (127) PubMed Google Scholar ). To assess the mechanisms behind Pin1-mediated effects, we treated PDAC cells with chemical inhibitors for the lysosomal degradation pathway (3-MA, Bafilomycin and Chloroquine) or proteasomal degradation pathway (MG132 and MLN4924). Inhibition of the proteasomal pathway increased PD-L1, but not ENT1, as shown ( Hu et al., 2017 42. Hu, Q. ∙ Qin, Y. ∙ Zhang, B. ... FBW7 increases the chemosensitivity of pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine through upregulation of ENT1 Oncol. Rep. 2017; 38 :2069-2077 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhang et al., 2018 102. Zhang, J. ∙ Bu, X. ∙ Wang, H. ... Cyclin D-CDK4 kinase destabilizes PD-L1 via cullin 3-SPOP to control cancer immune surveillance Nature. 2018; 553 :91-95 Crossref Scopus (306) PubMed Google Scholar ), while inhibition of the lysosomal pathway increased both PD-L1 and ENT1 ( Figure S5 G), suggesting that lysosomal degradation may be a common mechanism for Pin1-mediated regulation of PD-L1 and ENT1.
To support this possibility, we investigated Huntingtin interacting protein 1-related (HIP1R) ( Wang et al., 2019 93. Wang, H. ∙ Yao, H. ∙ Li, C. ... HIP1R targets PD-L1 to lysosomal degradation to alter T cell-mediated cytotoxicity Nat. Chem. Biol. 2019; 15 :42-50 Crossref Scopus (69) PubMed Google Scholar ) and CKLF Like MARVEL Transmembrane Domain Containing 6 (CMTM6) ( Burr et al., 2017 13. Burr, M.L. ∙ Sparbier, C.E. ∙ Chan, Y.C. ... CMTM6 maintains the expression of PD-L1 and regulates anti-tumour immunity Nature. 2017; 549 :101-105 Crossref Scopus (291) PubMed Google Scholar ), which promote and inhibit the endocytosis and lysosomal degradation of PD-L1, respectively, and also contain putative Pin1 substrate recognition sites (pSer/Thr-Pro motifs), whereas such Pin1 recognition sites are not present in PD-L1. Both Pin1 inhibitors dose-dependently increased HIP1R with a slower mobility and presumably in the phosphorylated form, which was also induced by Pin1 KD or KO ( Figures 5 A–5D) but was undetectable after treating cell lysates with calf intestinal phosphatase (CIP) ( Figure 5 E). Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) demonstrated that Pin1 bound to phosphorylated HIP1R under endogenous conditions and that this interaction was phosphatase sensitive ( Figure 5 E). By contrast, Pin1 inhibitors neither affected the PD-L1 stabilizing CMTM6, nor did Pin1 interact with CMTM6 ( Figures 5 A, 5C, and 5E). To determine the importance of HIP1R in regulating PD-L1 and ENT1 levels, we stably knocked down HIP1R in PDAC cells and found that HIP1R KD increased both PD-L1 and ENT1 levels ( Figure 5 F). These results together suggest that Pin1 promotes PD-L1 and ENT1 degradation by acting on phosphorylated HIP1R.
To identify the Pin1-binding site in HIP1R, we generated an Ala substitution (S929A) at the only putative and conserved S/P site, pSer929-Pro motif in HIP1R ( Figure S5 H). Unlike wild-type (WT) HIP1R, when introduced into PDAC cells, the S929A mutant not only failed to interact with Pin1 ( Figures 5 H and 5I) but also increased the levels of PD-L1 and ENT1 ( Figure 5 G), similar to Pin1 inhibitors, Pin1 KD or KO, or HIP1R KD ( Figures 4 C, 4D, and 5 F). Notably, the pSer929-Pro in HIP1R is located within its actin-binding domain ( Figure S5 H), which is critical for HIP1R-mediated endocytosis and lysosomal degradation ( Gottfried et al., 2010 33. Gottfried, I. ∙ Ehrlich, M. ∙ Ashery, U. The Sla2p/HIP1/HIP1R family: similar structure, similar function in endocytosis? Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2010; 38 :187-191 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Messa et al., 2014 70. Messa, M. ∙ Fernández-Busnadiego, R. ∙ Sun, E.W. ... Epsin deficiency impairs endocytosis by stalling the actin-dependent invagination of endocytic clathrin-coated pits eLife. 2014; 3 :e03311 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). These results suggest that the S929A mutation might impair the ability of HIP1R to bind actin and promote the endocytosis of PD-L1 and ENT1 to lysosomes. Indeed, WT HIP1R, but not its S929A mutant, interacted with actin ( Figure 5 J) and colocalized with Pin1, PD-L1 and ENT1 to peri-nuclear lysosomes, as marked by the lysosomal marker LAMP1 ( Figures 5 K–5N). Cycloheximide (CHX) chase assay demonstrated that the HIP1R, but not its S929A mutant, was unstable ( Figure S5 I). Thus, Pin1 promotes the endocytosis and lysosomal degradation of PD-L1 and ENT1 presumably by acting on the pSer929-Pro motif in HIP1R to facilitate actin binding.
Given that targeting Pin1 robustly induces the cell-surface expression of ENT1 and PD-L1 in PDAC cells, a critical question is whether targeting Pin1 would affect the therapeutic response to GEM and αPD1. Thus, we targeted Pin1 in established human PDAC organoids without any stromal cells to avoid indirect effects ( Koikawa et al., 2018a 49. Koikawa, K. ∙ Ohuchida, K. ∙ Ando, Y. ... Basement membrane destruction by pancreatic stellate cells leads to local invasion in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma Cancer Lett. 2018; 425 :65-77 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), followed by the organoid apoptosis assay using time-lapse imaging to visualize and quantify the dynamic changes in organoid apoptosis ( Figure 6 A). As expected, both Pin1 inhibitors time-dependently induced ENT1 and PD-L1 levels ( Figure 6 B), and time- and dose-dependently sensitized PDAC organoids to GEM-induce apoptosis, with highly synergistic effects ( Figures 6 C–6E and S6 A). The similar effect was observed in Pin1i with ENT1-dependent 5-FU ( Figures S6 G and S6H). Pin1 KO or introduction of HIP1R929A mutant into the PDAC organoids resulted in similar synergy with GEM treatment ( Figure S5 J), further supporting our model. To examine the importance of ENT expression for modulating GEM responsiveness by Pin1i, we treated Pin1i pre-treated WT or ENT1-KD PDAC organoids with GEM. Pin1i-2 induced apoptosis in WT PDAC organoids but not in ENT1-KD PDAC organoids ( Figures S6 B and S6C), supporting the role of ENT1 in GEM response.
To examine the effects of Pin1 inhibition on the ability of αPD1 to induce PDAC organoid apoptosis, Pin1i pre-treated human PDAC organoids and activated human primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were subjected to the organoid apoptosis assay ( Figure 6 A) ( Dijkstra et al., 2018 19.

Both Pin1 inhibitors increased the ability of αPD1 or αPDL1 to induce organoid apoptosis, and the effects were again dose dependent and highly synergistic ( Figures 6 F–6H, S6 D, S6I, and S6J). To exclude possible off-target effects of Pin1 inhibitors, we conducted the same experiment with Pin1 KO and HIP1R929A PDAC organoids with activated human PBMCs and found a similar enhancement of αPD1 anti-tumor effects ( Figure S5 K). Pin1i-2 also promoted the apoptosis of WT PDAC organoids but not of PD-L1-KD PDAC organoids ( Figures S6 E and S6F), supporting that the effects of Pin1 inhibition and αPD1 are dependent on PD-L1 expression. Moreover, both Pin1 inhibitors time- and dose-dependently enhanced the ability of G+P to induce apoptosis of PDAC organoids, and the effects were also highly synergistic ( Figures 6 I–6K, S6 K, and S6L; Video S2 ).

Pin1 inhibitors synergize with immunochemotherapy (GEM + αPD1) to induce human PDAC organoid apoptosis, related Figures 6 and S6 Pin1i pre-treated human PDAC2 organoids were co-cultured with activated human PBMCs, and then then treated with GEM and/or αPD1, followed by assaying PDAC organoid apoptosis using green fluorescent Caspase 3/7 reagent and live-cell time-lapse imaging for 40 hr (Pin1i-1 10 μM, Pin1i-2 5 μM, GEM 10 nM, and αPD1 100 μg/ml).
To use an autologous organoid model to confirm the above findings that CD8 + cytotoxic T cells are important factor for the response of Pin1i + αPD1 therapy in GDA mice ( Figures 1 H and S2 E–S2G), we co-cultured KPC mouse PDAC organoids with activated CD8 + T cells derived from the same KPC tumor-bearing mice or their tumor-free littermates. As expected, the CD8 + T cells derived from tumor-bearing mice were significantly more effective in inducing organoid apoptosis than those from non-tumor-bearing controls ( Figures 6 L and S6 M). More importantly, Pin1i synergized with αPD1 to induce PDAC organoid apoptosis ( Figures 6 M and 6N), and the synergistic effects were also upheld when GEM was used ( Figures S6 N and S6O), as in GDA mice ( Figure 1 E), confirming the critical role of CD8 + CTLs for Pin1 inhibitors to potentiate immunotherapy response. Thus, targeting Pin1 acts on PDAC cells not only to inhibit multiple cancer pathways and induce the cell-surface expression of PD-L1 and ENT1 but also to synergize with immunochemotherapy to induce apoptosis of human and mouse PDAC organoids.
To determine whether Pin1 inhibitors are able to disrupt the highly desmoplastic and immunosuppressive TME and render primary PDAC tumors eradicable by immunochemotherapy in a GEMM of PDAC, we used KPC mice expressing commonly occurring Kras G12D and p53 R172H mutations in the pancreas. These mice developed the spectrum of aggressive PDAC with 100% penetrance, which recapitulate tumor heterogeneity, desmoplastic and immunosuppressive TME, poor immunogenicity, and rapid progression typical of human disease ( Bayne et al., 2012 6.

We treated overt tumor-bearing KPC mice with Pin1i, G+P or their combination. As shown ( Jiang et al., 2016 45. Jiang, H. ∙ Hegde, S. ∙ Knolhoff, B.L. ... Targeting focal adhesion kinase renders pancreatic cancers responsive to checkpoint immunotherapy Nat. Med. 2016; 22 :851-860 Crossref Scopus (444) PubMed Google Scholar ), G+P neither affected the desmoplastic and immunosuppressive TME, nor increased survival, with most mice succumbing to the disease within 3 months ( Figures 7 B and 7D–7F). However, Pin1i-1 or -2 and G+P combination suppressed cancer cell proliferation, and CAF activation and proliferation ( Figures 7 A, 7C, S7 A, and S7B), disrupted the desmoplastic and immunosuppressive TME, increased tumor-infiltrating CD8α + Granzyme B + CTLs ( Figures 7 B, 7D, and 7E) and induced PD-L1 and ENT1 expression in cancer cells ( Figures S7 C and S7D). Importantly, Pin1i-1 or -2 and G+P combination drastically increased survival, with 60%–70% of treated mice surviving for at least 6 months after treatment ( Figure 7 F). Upon necropsy, these surviving mice had no obvious macroscopic tumors, and only residual microscopic tumors were notable ( Figures 7 G and S7 E), without any liver metastases ( Figure S7 F), indicating that tumors are disappearing despite continuous expression of oncogenic mutant Kras and p53 in the pancreas. In conclusion, Pin1 inhibitors not only block multiple cancer pathways, disrupt the desmoplastic and immunosuppressive TME, and induce PD-L1 and ENT1 expression but also render PDAC tumors eradicable by immunochemotherapy in GDA and KPC mice ( Figure S7 G).

Section: Discussion

PDAC is notoriously resistant to current therapies due to inherent tumor heterogeneity and highly desmoplastic and immunosuppressive TME. Here, we find that Pin1 is overexpressed both in cancer cells and CAFs in PDAC patients and highly correlates with the desmoplastic and immunosuppressive TME and poor patient survival. Functionally, besides activating multiple cancer pathways, Pin1 drives the desmoplastic and immunosuppressive TME and promotes tumor malignancy and drug resistance by acting on stromal cells such as CAFs and inducing endocytosis and degradation PD-L1 and ENT1 in cancer cells by acting on pS929-HIP1R. Consequently, targeting Pin1 offers a unique and promising approach to render this deadly cancer eradicable. These findings support a possible design of future clinical trials using Pin1 inhibitors in combination with immunochemotherapy for PDAC patients given that the ATRA+ATO therapy is a safe modality to cure most APL patients.
In PDAC, stromal CAFs play a vital role in promoting the desmoplastic and immunosuppressive TME, as well as tumor growth and malignancy, and have emerged as cancer targets ( Sahai et al., 2020 83. Sahai, E. ∙ Astsaturov, I. ∙ Cukierman, E. ... A framework for advancing our understanding of cancer-associated fibroblasts Nat. Rev.

Fibroblasts in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma: Biological Mechanisms and Therapeutic Targets Gastroenterology. 2019; 156 :2085-2096 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the mechanisms controlling CAF activation and function are still not fully understood. We show that Pin1 is overexpressed in CAFs and correlates with the desmoplastic and immunosuppressive TME and poor survival. Targeting Pin1 not only inhibits multiple oncogenic pathways in CAFs but also suppresses their growth, activation, and production of cytokines implicated in immunosuppression ( Erkan et al., 2012 25.

TGFβ attenuates tumour response to PD-L1 blockade by contributing to exclusion of T cells Nature. 2018; 554 :544-548 Crossref Scopus (1236) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, targeting Pin1 eliminates the ability of CAFs to promote the desmoplastic TME, tumor growth, and malignancy in human PDAC organoids and/or PDOX mice. Moreover, Pin1 inhibitors also potently increase tumor-infiltrating CD8 + CTLs and decrease immunosuppressive cells in GDA and KPC mice. These results are consistent with the reports that ATRA reduces the desmoplastic and immunosuppressive TME, and tumor growth and malignancy via multiple cancer and CAF-related pathways ( Chen et al., 2019 15.

Commun. 2020; 11 :4841 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ), because many ATRA-mediated effects might be at least partially due to Pin1 inhibition ( Wei et al., 2015 96. Wei, S. ∙ Kozono, S. ∙ Kats, L. ... Active Pin1 is a key target of all-trans retinoic acid in acute promyelocytic leukemia and breast cancer Nat.

The isomerase PIN1 controls numerous cancer-driving pathways and is a unique drug target Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2016; 16 :463-478 Crossref Scopus (127) PubMed Google Scholar ). Of note, CAFs are heterogenous and their functions are complex in PDAC. Our results suggest that Pin1 inhibition might target αSMA + CAFs (myCAFs) and PDGFRα + CAFs (iCAFs), with the latter contributing to desmoplastic immune suppressive TME by secreting collagens and cytokines ( Garg et al., 2018 29.

Protein degradation is a key mechanism to regulate not only numerous oncogenic proteins ( Lu and Hunter, 2014 61. Lu, Z. ∙ Hunter, T.

The isomerase PIN1 controls numerous cancer-driving pathways and is a unique drug target Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2016; 16 :463-478 Crossref Scopus (127) PubMed Google Scholar ), but also many cancer therapeutic targets/receptors biomarkers, including PD-L1 ( Burr et al., 2017 13.

Cyclin D-CDK4 kinase destabilizes PD-L1 via cullin 3-SPOP to control cancer immune surveillance Nature. 2018; 553 :91-95 Crossref Scopus (306) PubMed Google Scholar ), and ENT1 ( Hu et al., 2017 42.

Rep. 2017; 38 :2069-2077 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ). Notably, HIP1R is a key protein in lysosomal proteolysis by binding with a membrane protein such as PD-L1 and cytoplasmic actin for endocytosis ( Gottfried et al., 2010 33. Gottfried, I. ∙ Ehrlich, M. ∙ Ashery, U. The Sla2p/HIP1/HIP1R family: similar structure, similar function in endocytosis? Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2010; 38 :187-191 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Messa et al., 2014 70. Messa, M. ∙ Fernández-Busnadiego, R. ∙ Sun, E.W. ...

However, whether this PD-L1 degradation is further regulated is not known, which is especially important for PDAC because most PDAC patients have very low PD-L1 ( Tessier-Cloutier et al., 2017 90. Tessier-Cloutier, B. ∙ Kalloger, S.E. ∙ Al-Kandari, M. ... Programmed cell death ligand 1 cut-point is associated with reduced disease specific survival in resected pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma BMC Cancer. 2017; 17 :618 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ). We demonstrated that Pin1 binds to the pSer929-Pro motif in HIP1R and also promotes the HIP1R-actin interaction and HIP1R-mediated endocytosis and lysosomal degradation of PD-L1 and ENT1 in PDAC cells. Moreover, Pin1 inhibition highly synergizes with αPD1 to promote the ability of activated lymphocytes to induce human and KPC PDAC organoid apoptosis and to dramatically reduce tumor growth and increase overall survival of GDA mice. These results are consistent with the recent findings that human cancer patients with elevated PD-L1 levels tend to respond better to PD-1 blockade ( Herbst et al., 2014 37. Herbst, R.S. ∙ Soria, J.C. ∙ Kowanetz, M. ... Predictive correlates of response to the anti-PD-L1 antibody MPDL3280A in cancer patients Nature. 2014; 515 :563-567 Crossref Scopus (3140) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, induction of PD-L1 expression in cancer cells in response to radiation ( Herter-Sprie et al., 2016 38. Herter-Sprie, G.S. ∙ Koyama, S. ∙ Korideck, H. ... Synergy of radiotherapy and PD-1 blockade in Kras-mutant lung cancer JCI Insight. 2016; 1 :e87415 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), PARP inhibitors ( Jiao et al., 2017 46. Jiao, S. ∙ Xia, W. ∙ Yamaguchi, H. ... PARP Inhibitor Upregulates PD-L1 Expression and Enhances Cancer-Associated Immunosuppression Clin. Cancer Res. 2017; 23 :3711-3720 Crossref Scopus (372) PubMed Google Scholar ), or inhibition of PD-L1 proteasomal proteolysis using CDK4/6 inhibitors ( Zhang et al., 2018 102. Zhang, J. ∙ Bu, X. ∙ Wang, H. ... Cyclin D-CDK4 kinase destabilizes PD-L1 via cullin 3-SPOP to control cancer immune surveillance Nature. 2018; 553 :91-95 Crossref Scopus (306) PubMed Google Scholar ) also potentiates ICB efficacy.
It is likely that without or before ICB therapy, tumors with high PD-L1 will gain an advantage by avoiding immune surveillance resulting in poor outcomes. However, in response to αPD1 therapy, immune cells might be activated as well as protected from exhaustion to recognize and kill cancer cells expressing high PD-L1 at the cell surface. This might be especially true if cancer cells sensitize to the therapy by Pin1 inhibitors, which block multiple cancer pathways and disrupt the desmoplastic and immunosuppressive TME, are combined with GEM, which is cytotoxic to cancer cells, as suggested by our results in human organoids, GDA mice, and KPC mice. However, more experiments are needed to define the mechanisms by which high PD-L1 levels in cancer cells improve αPD1 response, and whether Pin1 in immune cells including CD8 + CTLs contributes to their function and tumor killing response. Notably, our results also indicate that combination treatment with Pin1 inhibitor and αPD1 induces only a small minority of tumors (12.5%) to complete regression, but leads to the complete regressions in the vast majority (87.5%) of tumors when given in combination with low-dose GEM in GDA mice, underscoring the importance of cytotoxic damage to cancer cells.
Our results together suggest a potential new treatment strategy using Pin1 inhibitors in combination with αPD1 and GEM to render aggressive PDAC eradicable. Our experimental design with a Pin1 inhibitor treatment for 3 days before addition of the combination of GEM and αPD1 treatment is consistent with the ability of Pin1 inhibitors to reduce multiple cancer pathways in cancer cells and CAFs, to induce the cell-surface expression of PD-L1 and ENT in cancer cells, to synergize with GEM and αPD1 to induce organoid apoptosis, and to have better efficacy in various PDAC mice models. We believe, prior to GEM and αPD1 treatments, it may be important to “prime” the tumor with Pin1 inhibition to reduce multiple cancer pathways in cancer cells and CAFs and to induce the cell-surface expression of PD-L1 and ENT in cancer cells, to prepare the tumor and its microenvironment for immunochemotherapy, but further work needs to define the exact impact and timing for such additional Pin1 inhibitor treatment.
We speculate that the Pin1 inhibitor-immunochemotherapy combination would add little and/or non-overlapping toxicity to immunochemotherapy. ATRA+ATO are well tolerated and render APL curable with an acceptable safety profile even in children ( de Thé and Chen, 2010 18. de Thé, H. ∙ Chen, Z. Acute promyelocytic leukaemia: novel insights into the mechanisms of cure Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2010; 10 :775-783 Crossref Scopus (336) PubMed Google Scholar ), and PIN1 −/− mice develop normally ( Liou et al., 2002 59. Liou, Y.C. ∙ Ryo, A. ∙ Huang, H.K. ...

USA. 2002; 99 :1335-1340 Crossref Scopus (286) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhou and Lu, 2016 103. Zhou, X.Z. ∙ Lu, K.P. The isomerase PIN1 controls numerous cancer-driving pathways and is a unique drug target Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2016; 16 :463-478 Crossref Scopus (127) PubMed Google Scholar ). A recent phase I study found that adding ATRA to GEM and nab-paclitaxel in the treatment of advanced PDAC is safe and tolerable and results in an encouraging progression-free survival for over 11 months, as well as reprograms the TME ( Kocher et al., 2020 48. Kocher, H.M. ∙ Basu, B. ∙ Froeling, F.E.M. ... Phase I clinical trial repurposing all-trans retinoic acid as a stromal targeting agent for pancreatic cancer Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :4841 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ), consistent with our findings. The efficacy of ATRA is limited by a short half-life of 45 min in humans ( Lefebvre et al., 1991 54. Lefebvre, P. ∙ Thomas, G. ∙ Gourmel, B. ... Pharmacokinetics of oral all-trans retinoic acid in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia Leukemia. 1991; 5 :1054-1058 PubMed Google Scholar ) and requires addition of ATO to cure APL ( de Thé and Chen, 2010 18. de Thé, H. ∙ Chen, Z. Acute promyelocytic leukaemia: novel insights into the mechanisms of cure Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2010; 10 :775-783 Crossref Scopus (336) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, liposomal ATRA has a longer half-life with significant efficacy in APL patients as monotherapy ( Jain et al., 2014 44. Jain, P. ∙ Kantarjian, H. ∙ Estey, E. ... Single-agent liposomal all-trans-retinoic Acid as initial therapy for acute promyelocytic leukemia: 13-year follow-up data Clin. Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk. 2014; 14 :e47-e49 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this context, our data show that the covalent Pin1 inhibitor Sulfopin, which targets the ATO-binding site ( Dubiella et al., 2021 22. Dubiella, C. ∙ Pinch, B.J. ∙ Koikawa, K. ... Sulfopin is a covalent inhibitor of Pin1 that blocks Myc-driven tumors in vivo Nat. Chem. Biol. 2021; Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ), matches ATRA+ATO with regard to efficacy in PDAC.
In summary, we uncover a unique therapeutic strategy and elucidate the underlying mechanisms by which targeting Pin1 renders aggressive PDAC eradicable by synergizing with immunochemotherapy, paving the way for clinical trials and further development of new Pin1 inhibitors to evaluate their clinical impact on patients with PDAC.
Our studies present pre-clinical data that justify further development of Pin1 inhibitors in preparation for first-in-human trials, but they have some limitations. A potential concern is that PD-L1 expression induced by Pin1 inhibition might aid immune evasion of cancer cells, and hence combination of a Pin1 inhibitor with a ICB might be preferable to capitalize on increased PD-L1 expression to increase the synergy. Although we found complete resolution of a majority of PDAC tumors in the GDA model, and long sustained reemission in the majority of the spontaneous PDAC tumors in the genetic KPC mouse model, the KPC mice have a minimal residual disease and some KPC mice showed a resistance to Pin1i after long treatment.

Cancer. 2019; 144 :1401-1413 Crossref Scopus (7) PubMed Google Scholar ), and the cells were tested for CK19, SMA, Vimentin and CD45 to verify their identity and purity, and used within 8 passages for all experiments. Cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Sigma-Aldrich Co.) supplemented with 5%–10% fetal bovine serum, streptomycin (100 mg/ml), and penicillin (100 mg/ml) at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 10% CO2. All cell lines were tested negative for mycoplasma contamination. To distinguish and visualize PDAC cells and CAFs in live-cell imaging fluorescence microscopy, PDAC cells were labeled with green fluorescent protein (GFP) or Cell Tracker™ Green (C7025, Life Technologies), whereas CAFs were labeled with Cell Tracker™ Red (C34552, Life Technologies).
Pin1i-1 (ATRA+ATO) treatment was described as previously ( Kozono et al., 2018 52. Kozono, S. ∙ Lin, Y.M. ∙ Seo, H.S. ... Arsenic targets Pin1 and cooperates with retinoic acid to inhibit cancer-driving pathways and tumor-initiating cells Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :3069 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wei et al., 2015 96. Wei, S. ∙ Kozono, S. ∙ Kats, L. ... Active Pin1 is a key target of all-trans retinoic acid in acute promyelocytic leukemia and breast cancer Nat. Med. 2015; 21 :457-466 Crossref Scopus (172) PubMed Google Scholar ), so did Pin1i-2 (Sulfopin) treatment ( Dubiella et al., 2021 22. Dubiella, C. ∙ Pinch, B.J. ∙ Koikawa, K. ... Sulfopin is a covalent inhibitor of Pin1 that blocks Myc-driven tumors in vivo Nat. Chem. Biol. 2021; Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, all mice were randomly selected to receive treatments groups. Tumor sizes were measured by weekly palpation with electronic caliper or ultrasound, and when tumors were reached > 0.5cm, the treatment was started. Briefly, animals were placed under general anesthesia with 2%–3% isoflurane once a week. Under general anesthesia, the abdominal wall became very flaccid, and the muscle tone of the mouse was very low. The mouse was scuffed with the left hand to allow for palpation and measurement with the right hand. This allowed to detect the firm pancreatic mass by palpation, and to determine its size by electronic caliper measurements. Mice in our hands did not develop ascites, and the firm upper abdominal mass was easily identified below the rib cage in the left abdomen. In the GDA model and PDX models, palpable tumors predictably were detectable within 4-7 days post implantation. Hence electronic caliper measurements under general anesthesia were our routine method, and confirmatory ultrasound was conducted in some cases ( Figure S1 B). In the transgenic KPC mice, where we expected spontaneous tumor development, we started weekly palpation from age 8 weeks. When we could not clearly detect the tumor by palpation after age 12 weeks, we monitored mice by ultrasound. Once we detected the maximum length > 0.5 cm tumor, we randomized the mice to treatment, and then followed tumor growth by electronic caliper measurement. To validate the external caliper measurements, we measured the tumor size prior to euthanization of the mice and then measured the actual tumor size upon necropsy to ascertain concordance. Mice were treated with ATO (2 mg/kg, i.p., 3 times/week, Sigma) and subcutaneous implantation of 5 mg 21-day slow-releasing ATRA pellets (Innovative Research of America) (Pin1i-1) or placebo pellets (Innovative Research of America), or Sulfopin (40 mg/kg, i.p., every day) (Pin1i-2) or vehicle (Sulfopin diluted solution; 5% NMP, 5% Solutol, 20% DMSO), and/or Gemcitabine (10mg/kg or 20mg/kg, i.p., weekly) or vehicle (PBS), and/or anti-PD1 (200 μg, i.p., every 3-4 days, BE0146, BioXcell) or vehicle (IgG isotype control, BE0090, BioXcell). To evaluate the effects of CD8 + T cell or NK1.1 + cell depletion in GDA mice, mice were treated with anti-CD8 (200 μg, i.p., twice a week, BE0117, BioXcell) ( Pantelidou et al., 2019 76. Pantelidou, C. ∙ Sonzogni, O. ∙ De Oliveria Taveira, M. ...

Natural killer cells act as rheostats modulating antiviral T cells Nature. 2011; 481 :394-398 Crossref Scopus (386) PubMed Google Scholar ), or vehicle (IgG isotype control), and/or Sulfopin (40 mg/kg, i.p., every day) (Pin1i-2) or vehicle (Sulfopin diluted solution; 5% NMP, 5% Solutol, 20% DMSO), and/or anti-PD1 (200 μg, i.p., every 3-4 days, BE0146, BioXcell) or vehicle (IgG isotype control). To test Sulfopin and/or PTX and/or anti-CTLA4 combination treatment in GDA mice, mice were treated with Sulfopin (40 mg/kg, i.p., every day) (Pin1i-2) or vehicle (Sulfopin diluted solution; 5% NMP, 5% Solutol, 20% DMSO), and/or PTX (10mg/kg i.p., weekly) or vehicle (PTX diluted solution; 10% DMSO, 40% PEG300, 5% Tween 80, 45% Saline), and/or anti-CTLA-4 (250 μg, i.p., every 3-4 days, BE0032, BioXcell) or vehicle (IgG isotype control). Tumor volumes were calculated using the formula L x W 2 × 0.52, where L and W represent length and width, respectively ( Kozono et al., 2018 52. Kozono, S. ∙ Lin, Y.M. ∙ Seo, H.S. ... Arsenic targets Pin1 and cooperates with retinoic acid to inhibit cancer-driving pathways and tumor-initiating cells Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :3069 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ). Survival events were scored when mice lost over 10% body weight, tumor burden reached 2.0 cm in diameter or per absolute survival events. All animal experiments were approved by the IACUC of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA, USA.
For indirect co-culture model, 5 × 10 3 primary human PDAC organoids were cultured in 50 μL GFR Matrigel (356231, Corning) with Organoid Media and 5 × 10 4 primary human CAFs, which were stably transfected with Pin1 shRNA or control vector, were then seeded on the top of Matrigel for 10 days, followed by monitoring organoid growth using Cyntellect Celigo (Cyntellect) and analyzing the organoid size using Cyntellect Celigo software (version 1.3, Cyntellect). Direct co-culture model of PDAC organoids and CAFs was as described ( Koikawa et al., 2018a 49. Koikawa, K. ∙ Ohuchida, K. ∙ Ando, Y. ...

Briefly, primary human PDAC organoid cells were transfected with GFP and subjected to organoid culture. Human primary CAFs were pre-treated with Pin1 inhibitor (Pin1i-1 or Pin1i-2), or stably transfected with Pin1 CRISPR KO or vector control. Before the start of co-culture, CAFs were stained in red with cell tracker red (C34452, Invitrogen) for visualization. 1 × 10 4 Organoids were co-cultured with 1 × 10 5 human primary CAFs on the Matrigel and collagen (354249, BD Biosciences) mixed gel coated 6 well plate, followed by observing time lapse images using BZ-X800 fluorescence microscope (KEYENCE) and examining the organoid area using BZ-X 800 analyzer software (KEYENCE).
1) For assaying the effects of Pin1 inhibition on GEM sensitivity, 5 × 10 3 primary human PDAC organoids were cultured in 50 μL GFR Matrigel (356231, Corning) for 7 days and then the organoids were treated with control (DMSO) or Pin1 inhibitors (Pin1i-1, or Pin1i-2) for 3 days. The organoids were isolated from Matrigel using collagenase, and seed Matrigel coated 96 well plate, and then treated with control (PBS) or GEM, or control (DMSO) or 5-FU, followed by assaying organoid apoptosis using fluorescent caspase 3/7 and live-cell time lapse imaging for 24 hr.

Lipid droplet accumulation assay was performed as described previously ( Endo et al., 2017 23. Endo, S. ∙ Nakata, K. ∙ Ohuchida, K. ... Autophagy Is Required for Activation of Pancreatic Stellate Cells, Associated With Pancreatic Cancer Progression and Promotes Growth of Pancreatic Tumors in Mice Gastroenterology. 2017; 152 :1492-1506 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (100) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cells were stained with 1 mg/mL 4,4-difluoro-1,3,5,7,8-pentamethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene (bodipy 493/503; #D-3922; Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), and the number of bodipy-positive punctures per cell in 20 cells was counted.
In vitro PDAC organoids or in vivo mouse pancreas tissues were cut into 4-μm-thick sections from paraffin-embedded samples, deparaffinized in Histoclear, and rehydrated through an ethanol gradient. Antigen retrieval was achieved by microwaving or autoclaving the sections in sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) or Tris-EDTA (pH 8.0). Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by incubation with 3% hydrogen for 15 min. After blocking with 5% Goat serum for 30 min at room temperature (RT), the sections were incubated with antibodies in 1% Goat serum buffer (1:1000) overnight at 4°C. Then the sections were incubated with HRP-conjugate secondary antibodies (1:1000, Mouse IgG; PI-2000 or Rabbit IgG; PI-1000, VECTOR) for 60 min at RT. Counterstaining was performed with hematoxylin. Sirius red staining was conducted using a Picrosirius Red Staining Kit (24901, Polysciences, Inc.), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Whole-tissue slide scans at 4 × magnification was performed on BZ-X800 fluorescence microscope (KEYENCE), and scanned at least three different representative areas at 10x magnification. Image analysis was performed by thresholding for positive staining and normalizing to total tissue area, using ImageJ (NIH) and BZ-X800 analyzer (KEYENCE). IHC intensity was semi-quantified manually in a double-blind manner as a 3-tier scale (0; negative to weak, 1; moderate, 2; strong) based on previous reports ( Kozono et al., 2018 52. Kozono, S. ∙ Lin, Y.M. ∙ Seo, H.S. ... Arsenic targets Pin1 and cooperates with retinoic acid to inhibit cancer-driving pathways and tumor-initiating cells Nat.

For Pin1 analysis, Low staining was defined as a staining intensity of “0” or “1 in under 50% of cancer or CAF cells,” and high staining was defined as a staining intensity of “2” and “1 in >50% cancer or CAF cells.”
Cells were seeded on cover glass (#12-542A Fisher Scientific) at approximately 60% confluence and subsequently treated with Pin1i-1 or Pin1i-2 for 72 hours. At 72 hours, cells were fixed by 4% PFA for 20 min, and washed three times with PBS, each time for 5 min. Cells were then permeabilized with 0%–0.1% Triton X-100 and blocked in 3% BSA in PBS for 1 hour at RT. Human PDAC or mouse tumor tissue sections were boiled in 10 mM sodium citrate (pH 6.0), for antigen retrieval after deparaffinization. The sections were permeabilized with PBS containing 0.1%–0.5% Triton X-100 and blocked with PBS containing 5% Goat serum for 30 min RT. The primary antibodies were diluted in PBS containing 1% Goat serum (1:100) and incubated in slides for overnight at 4°C. The cells were rinsed by PBS three times, each time for 5 min. Secondary antibodies were diluted in PBS (1:200) and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. 20 μg/ml DAPI was used to label nuclear of cells. Whole-tissue slide scans at 4 × magnification was performed on BZ-X800 fluorescence microscope (KEYENCE), and scanned at least three different representative areas at 10x magnification (for tissue analysis) or 20x magnification (for cell analysis). Image analysis was performed by thresholding for positive staining and normalizing to total tissue area, using ImageJ (NIH) and BZ-X800 analyzer (KEYENCE).
t-CyCIF imaging consisted of multiple cycles of antibody incubation, imaging, and fluorophore inactivation. The t-CyCIF experimental protocol was conducted as previously described ( Du et al., 2019 21. Du, Z. ∙ Lin, J.R. ∙ Rashid, R. ... Qualifying antibodies for image-based immune profiling and multiplexed tissue imaging Nat. Protoc. 2019; 14 :2900-2930 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lin et al., 2018 58. Lin, J.R. ∙ Izar, B. ∙ Wang, S. ... Highly multiplexed immunofluorescence imaging of human tissues and tumors using t-CyCIF and conventional optical microscopes eLife. 2018; 7 :e31657 Crossref Scopus (131) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, 5 micron sections from 9 FFPE pancreatic adenocarcinoma specimens were baked at 60°C for 30 min, dewaxed using Bond Dewax Solution (Leica Biosystems) at 72°C, and antigen retrieval was performed with Epitope Retrieval 1 Solution (Leica Biosystems) at 100°C for 20 minutes using the BOND RX Automated IHC/ISH Stainer (Leica Biosystems). All antibodies were diluted in Odyssey Intercept Buffer (plus Hoechst 33342 0.25 μg/mL; LI-COR Biosciences) and incubated overnight at 4°C in the dark. See the Key Resources Table for the complete list of antibodies (note that PDGFRα staining was non-specific and inadequate to detect iCAFs). Slides were coverslipped using 20%–50% glycerol solution (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS. Images were taken using DAPI, FITC, Cy3, and Cy5 channels on the RareCyte CyteFinder Instrument (20x/0.75NA objective lens, RareCyte Inc. Seattle WA). After imaging, the fluorophores were inactivated by incubating with photobleaching solution (4.5% H2O2 and 20 mM NaOH in PBS) for 30 minutes under LED lights (this step was repeated twice).
The image processing of tissue cyclic immunofluorescence is organized in the following steps, each of which is described in detail below: i) the software ASHLAR is used to stitch, register, and correct for image acquisition artifacts (using the BaSiC algorithm). The output of ASHLAR is a single pyramid ome.tiff file for each region imaged; ii) the ome.tiff file is re-cut into tiles (typically 5000x5000 pixels) containing only the highest resolution image for all channels. One random cropped image (250x250 pixels) per tile is outputted for segmentation training (using ImageJ/Fiji); iii) using the ilastik software the labeling of nuclear, cytoplasmic and background areas are trained on the cropped images. Based on the user training the Ilastik software outputs a 3-color RGB image with label probabilities; iv) the RBG probability images are thresholded and watershed in MATLAB to segment the nuclear area. The cytoplasmic measurements are derived by dilating the nuclear mask; v) single-cell measurements are extracted for each channel (cell pixel median and mean for both nuclear and cytoplasmic area) as well as morphological measurements of area, solidity, and cell coordinates location.
The BaSiC ImageJ plugin tool was used to perform background and shading correction of the original images ( Peng et al., 2017 77. Peng, T. ∙ Thorn, K. ∙ Schroeder, T. ... A BaSiC tool for background and shading correction of optical microscopy images Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :14836 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ). The BaSiC algorithm calculates the flatfield, the change in effective illumination across an image, and the darkfield, which captures the camera offset and thermal noise. The dark field correction image is subtracted from the original image, and the result is divided by the flatfield image correction to obtain the final image.
Alignment by Simultaneous Harmonization of Layer/Adjacency Registration (ASHLAR) is used to stitch together image tiles and register image tiles in subsequent layers to those in the first layer ( Lin et al., 2018 58. Lin, J.R. ∙ Izar, B. ∙ Wang, S. ... Highly multiplexed immunofluorescence imaging of human tissues and tumors using t-CyCIF and conventional optical microscopes eLife. 2018; 7 :e31657 Crossref Scopus (131) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rashid et al., 2019 79. Rashid, R. ∙ Gaglia, G. ∙ Chen, Y.A. ... Highly multiplexed immunofluorescence images and single-cell data of immune markers in tonsil and lung cancer Sci. Data. 2019; 6 :323 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ). For the first image layer, neighboring image tiles are aligned to one another via a phase correlation algorithm that corrects for local state positioning error. A similar method is applied for subsequent layers to align tiles to their corresponding tile in the first layer. ASHLAR outputs an OME-TIFF file containing a multi-channel mosaic of the full image across all imaging cycles. Full codes available at: https://github.com/labsyspharm/ashlar .
ilastik is a machine learning based bioimage analysis tool that is used to obtain nuclear and cytoplasmic segmentation masks from OME-TIFF files ( Berg et al., 2019 7. Berg, S. ∙ Kutra, D. ∙ Kroeger, T. ... ilastik: interactive machine learning for (bio)image analysis Nat. Methods. 2019; 16 :1226-1232 Crossref Scopus (332) PubMed Google Scholar ). For increased processing speed, randomly selected 250 × 250 pixel regions from the original OME-TIFF are used as training data. ilastik’s interactive user interface allows the user to provide training annotations on the cropped regions. Users are presented with a subset of the channels stacked images and label pixels as either nuclear area, cytoplasmic area, or background area. The annotations are used to train non-linear classifiers that are applied to the entire image to obtain probability masks describing the probabilities of each pixel belonging to the nuclear, cytoplasmic, or background area. A MATLAB (version 2018a) script uses these masks to construct binary masks for nuclear and cytoplasmic area.
The data analysis is divided in a set of pre-processing steps in which data from different tissues is i) log2-transformed and aggregated together, ii) filtered for image analysis errors, and iii) normalized on a channel-by-channel basis across the entire data from a single experiment. All the steps are performed in MATLAB.
The image processing workflow outputs one ome.tiff image and one data file (.mat) for each tissue area imaged. The data matrices from each .mat file are concatenated into a single matrix for each metric measured (median/mean, nuclear/cytoplasmic) into a single structure (“AggrResults”). The morphological data (i.e., area, solidity, and centroid coordinates) is concatenated into a single structure (“MorpResults”), which also contains the indexing vector to keep track of the tissue of origin within the dataset.
Single cells are filtered to identify and potentially exclude from subsequent analysis errors in segmentation and cells lost through the rounds of imaging. Two types of criteria are used to filter cells: morphological criteria based on cell object segmented area, which are applied to all the rounds for the cell object, and DAPI-based criteria which are applied to the DAPI measurement for each imaging round. The latter corrects for cell loss during cycling and computational misalignment, which are both round specific.
Morphological filtering criteria are: 1) nuclear area within a user-input range; 2) cytoplasmic area within a user-input range; 3) nuclear object solidity above a user-input threshold. DAPI-based criteria are: 1) nuclear DAPI measurement above a user-input threshold; 2) ratio between nuclear and cytoplasmic DAPI measurement above a user-input threshold. The filter information for the criteria is allocated to a logical (0-1) structure ‘Filter’, which is used to select the cells to analyze in the further analysis by indexing. The threshold selection is dataset dependent and is performed by data inspection. The values used in each dataset are available with the codes used for data analysis in the github repository
https://github.com/santagatalab/2021_Koikawa_et_al_CyCIF_codes .
Each channel distribution is normalized by probability density function (pdf) centering and rescaling. The aim is to center the distribution of the log2 fluorescent signal at 0 and rescale the width of the distribution to be able to compare across channels. The data is first log-transformed (base 2). The standard normalization is performed using a 2-component Gaussian mixture model, each model capturing the negative and the positive cell population. If the 2-component model fails to approximate the channel distribution, two other strategies are attempted: i) a 3-component model is used assuming the components with the two highest means are the negative and positive distribution (i.e., discarding the lowest component) or ii) the user selects a percentage ‘x’ of assumed positive cells and a single Gaussian distribution fit is performed on the remainder of the data to capture the negative distribution. The single Gaussian fit is then used as the lower component in a 2-component model to estimate the distribution of the positive population. The strategy chosen for each channel in each dataset is available in the github repository https://github.com/santagatalab/2021_Koikawa_et_al_CyCIF_codes . The “add_coeff” is defined as the intersection of the negative and positive distributions. The “mult_coeff” is defined as the difference between the mean of the negative and positive distributions. The full distribution is normalized by subtracting the add_coeff and dividing by the mult_coeff. The normalization is performed on the nuclear and cytoplasmic single-cell, single-channel distributions individually. The data preprocessing workflow is performed on all datasets. The individual analyses used in the paper are performed only in select datasets as follows.
Cells from tissue-based experiments are classified into lineage compartments by cell type markers, by gating on the sign of the normalized values of cell type markers. Stromal cells were defined as double negatives for pan-cytokeratin and CD45. Stromal cells were subtyped by k-means clustering based on normalized values of alpha smooth muscle actin, CD44 and DPB1.
Biochemical experiments in vitro were routinely repeated at least three times, and the repeat number was increased according to effect size or sample variation. We estimated the sample size considering the variation and mean of the samples. No statistical method was used to predetermine sample size. No animals or samples were excluded from any analysis. Animals were randomly assigned groups for in vivo studies; no formal randomization method was applied when assigning animals for treatment. Group allocation and outcome assessment was not done in a blinded manner, including for animal studies. A computer program Prism 8 (GraphPad Software, CA, USA) was used for statistical analysis. All data are presented as the means ± s.d., followed by determining significant differences using the unpaired Student’s t test or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test or Pearson’s chi-square test. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used for all survival studies, and the groups were compared using the log-rank test. Differences of ∗ p < 0.05, ∗∗ p < 0.01, ∗∗∗ p = 0.001, and ∗∗∗∗ p < 0.001 were considered statistically significant.
