Title: Rapid 40S scanning and its regulation by mRNA structure during eukaryotic translation initiation


Abstract: Summary

How the eukaryotic 43S preinitiation complex scans along the 5′ untranslated region (5′ UTR) of a capped mRNA to locate the correct start codon remains elusive. Here, we directly track yeast 43S-mRNA binding, scanning, and 60S subunit joining by real-time single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy. 43S engagement with mRNA occurs through a slow, ATP-dependent process driven by multiple initiation factors including the helicase eIF4A. Once engaged, 43S scanning occurs rapidly and directionally at ∼100 nucleotides per second, independent of multiple cycles of ATP hydrolysis by RNA helicases post ribosomal loading. Scanning ribosomes can proceed through RNA secondary structures, but 5′ UTR hairpin sequences near start codons drive scanning ribosomes at start codons backward in the 5′ direction, requiring rescanning to arrive once more at a start codon. Direct observation of scanning ribosomes provides a mechanistic framework for translational regulation by 5′ UTR structures and upstream near-cognate start codons.

Section: Introduction

Translation initiation is tightly regulated to define the identity and quantity of the protein products encoded by 7-methylguanosine (m 7 G)-capped messenger RNAs (mRNAs) ( Aitken and Lorsch, 2012 1.

During initiation, the eukaryotic 40S ribosomal subunit forms a 43S preinitiation complex (PIC) with eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs) 1, 1A, 3, 5, and the eIF2⋅GTP⋅Met-tRNA i ternary complex (TC). The 43S PIC is recruited to the mRNA and must locate the correct start codon, forming a 48S PIC with the start codon base paired to the anticodon of Met-tRNA i in the ribosomal peptidyl site (P site). This is followed by the joining of the catalytic 60S subunit to assemble an 80S initiation complex (80S IC) competent for polypeptide elongation. Extensive biochemical, structural, and genetic analyses suggest that the 43S PIC binds near the 5′ end of a capped mRNA facilitated by a multi-protein eIF4F complex (eIF4A, eIF4E, and eIF4G) and moves directionally through the 5′ untranslated region (5′ UTR) in search of the first encountered start codon, in a process called scanning ( Figure 1 A; Hinnebusch, 2014 28.

Here, we apply direct real-time single-molecule analysis of eukaryotic translation initiation, monitoring the speed, directionality, and energy requirements of ribosomal scanning, and how scanning and start-site selection are modulated by 5′ UTR length and structures.

Section: Results

To observe the steps of 43S PIC-mRNA binding, scanning, and subsequent initiation, we modified our previously described in vitro single-molecule fluorescence assay ( Wang et al., 2019 69. Wang, J. ∙ Johnson, A.G. ∙ Lapointe, C.P. ... eIF5B gates the transition from translation initiation to elongation Nature. 2019; 573 :605-608 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ) to monitor yeast 43S recruitment and initiation on surface-immobilized capped mRNAs ( Figures 1 B and S1 A). Full-length 5′ m 7 G-capped, 3′ biotinylated RPL30 mRNAs (the first two codons encode Met-Phe) were immobilized in neutravidin-coated zero-mode waveguides (ZMWs); a delivery mixture of Cy3-40S (labeled at N terminus of uS19, at final 40 nM after mixing), Cy5-60S (labeled at C terminus of uL18, at 100 nM), eEF1A⋅GTP⋅Phe-(Cy3.5)-tRNA Phe TC (Cy3.5-Phe-TC, at 50 nM), and other requisite factors was added to ZMWs ( Figure S1 A, scheme 1), and ZMWs were simultaneously excited by a 532-nm laser with movies collected at 30°C and 10 frames per second (fps). This allowed us to track 43S recruitment by the appearance of the Cy3 signal (mean arrival time ∼128 s), the subsequent 60S joining by the ribosomal inter-subunit Cy3–Cy5 Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) (mean arrival time ∼65 s), and the transition to elongation on the 80S ribosome by the fluorescence of the first elongator Cy3.5-Phe-tRNA (mean arrival time ∼14 s) ( Figures 1 D, S1 B, and S1C). The timescale for the transition to elongation of the 80S complex was similar to that when the reaction started from the post-scanning 48S PIC ( Wang et al., 2019 69. Wang, J. ∙ Johnson, A.G. ∙ Lapointe, C.P. ... eIF5B gates the transition from translation initiation to elongation Nature. 2019; 573 :605-608 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ), which confirmed that the initiation events resulted in functional 80S complexes.
Under the above condition, ∼35% of the ZMWs contained one 43S binding event (we aimed for ∼30% of ZMWs loaded with a single mRNA), ∼74% of which led to 60S joining and ∼85% of the 80S complexes progressed to the elongation phase ( Figure S1 D). 43S-mRNA binding was inhibited on the same mRNA lacking an m 7 G-cap or when eIF4E and eIF4G, eIF4A, or eIF4B were omitted, or when 1 mM ATPγS was used instead of ATP (only ≤∼5% of ZMWs had one 43S binding event, and none of these events progressed to 60S joining, Figure S1 D). These controls assured that the reactions we observed arose mainly from the canonical cap-dependent pathways and suggested that eIF4A was essential for initiation even in the presence of another RNA helicase Ded1p, consistent with previous findings ( Gupta et al., 2018 23. Gupta, N. ∙ Lorsch, J.R. ∙ Hinnebusch, A.G. Yeast Ded1 promotes 48S translation preinitiation complex assembly in an mRNA-specific and eIF4F-dependent manner eLife. 2018; 7 :e38892 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To determine the origins for the slow rate of 43S binding to mRNA, we pre-incubated immobilized mRNAs for ∼10 min with an imaging buffer containing eIF4 proteins (eIF4A at 0.1 μM, eIF4B, eIF4E, and eIF4G), Pab1p, and Ded1p in the ZWMs prior to the delivery of all the other components ( Figure S1 A, scheme 2). Here, ∼29% of the total 43S recruitment events were fast (∼4.9 s), whereas the other ∼71% remained slow (>200 s, Figures 1 E, S1 C, and S1F). Raising eIF4A concentrations in the preincubation reaction to 0.6 and 6 μM substantially increased the proportion of the fast 43S recruitment events (∼50% and 70% fast, respectively, Figures 1 E, S1 C, and S1F). When ATP was omitted from the preincubation reaction ( Figure S1 A, scheme 3), the stimulatory effect was diminished ( Figures S1 C and S1F). Similar efficiencies of 43S recruitment were observed when the eIF4E concentration was raised from 0.6 to 1.2 or 2.4 μM ( Figure S1 G), indicating saturating eIF4E concentrations in our assays. Pab1p also had minor effects on the initiation kinetics, even when the 3′ end of the mRNA was not tethered on the imaging surface ( Figures S1 H–S1K). Thus, our results confirmed that 43S recruitment to a capped mRNA is driven by high eIF4A concentrations ( Yourik et al., 2017 72. Yourik, P. ∙ Aitken, C.E. ∙ Zhou, F. ... Yeast eIF4A enhances recruitment of mRNAs regardless of their structural complexity eLife. 2017; 6 :e31476 Crossref Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our data further demonstrated that a slow, eIF4A-dependent mRNA activation step is required for rapid 43S recruitment, and this activation step is strictly dependent on eIF4A-ATP hydrolysis.
Under our assay conditions, loading a second 43S PIC to a single mRNA within the 15-min imaging time window was rare (only ∼1% of traces). We reasoned that the same slow mRNA activation step by eIF4F might be needed for the second 43S PIC recruitment, and the 60 nt 5′ UTR of the RPL30 mRNA might be too short to bind two 43S PICs simultaneously. Thus, we pre-assembled post-scanning 48S PICs or 80S ICs with Cy3-40S and with the PMA1 mRNA (the same sequence as the RPL30 mRNA, except that the 5′ UTR was swapped to the 241-nt PMA1 5′ UTR, Figure 2 D) ( Figure S2 A). These complexes were tethered within ZMWs and pre-incubated with eIF4 proteins (eIF4A at 6 μM), then Cy3-43S PICs were delivered to the surface to start the reaction. Here, ∼22% (n = 45 of 200) of the pre-assembled 48S PIC molecules recruited a second, Cy3-43S, PIC; the efficiency was higher with pre-assembled 80S IC, ∼45% (n = 183 of 405) ( Figure S2 B). However, the lifetimes of the Cy3-43S PIC recruited to the 48S PIC or 80S IC (both ∼20 s) were at least 20-fold shorter than those recruited to an unoccupied mRNA ( Figure S2 C). These results suggest that the recruitment of a second 43S PIC may also require the activation step by eIF4 proteins, whereas the interaction of the second 43S PIC with the mRNA is unstable when there is a leading 40S or 80S at the start site.
To probe more deeply the roles of eIF4A, we labeled eIF4A with Cy3.5 via a ybbR-tag fused to its N terminus ( Yin et al., 2006 71. Yin, J. ∙ Lin, A.J. ∙ Golan, D.E. ... Site-specific protein labeling by Sfp phosphopantetheinyl transferase Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1 :280-285 Crossref Scopus (231) PubMed Google Scholar ). When final 40 nM Cy3.5-eIF4A was delivered to immobilized Cy3-labeled RPL30 mRNA (Cy3 at position +20, with A of the AUG codon as 0) that was pre-incubated with eIF4 proteins (including 0.6 μM unlabeled eIF4A, Figure S2 D), direct illumination of Cy3.5-eIF4A with the 532-nm laser revealed dynamic interactions of eIF4A with the mRNA ( k off = 0.19 s −1 , k on = 3.75 μM −1 s −1 ) ( Figure S2 E). Importantly, most of the binding events involved multiple copies of Cy3.5-eIF4A on the same mRNA (∼53.6% with two and ∼18.1% with three or more copies). The different copies of Cy3.5-eIF4A likely bind at different locations on the mRNA, as some, but not all, of the binding events led to FRET between Cy3-mRNA and Cy3.5-eIF4A ( Figure S2 E).
To observe eIF4A directly during initiation, we added final 40 nM Cy3.5-eIF4A to the delivery mixture alongside the ribosomal components in the real-time initiation assay as detailed above ( Figure S2 F). The Cy3.5-eIF4A was mixed with the ribosomes at 4°C for ∼15 min before being delivered to the immobilized RPL30 mRNAs that were pre-incubated with 0.6 μM unlabeled eIF4A and other eIF4 proteins. Here, Cy3.5-eIF4A also dynamically interacted with the mRNA or mRNA-ribosome complex throughout the whole initiation process and after 80S assembly ( Figure S2 G). About 50% (n = 96 of 201) of the Cy3-43S PIC recruitment events occurred when the mRNA was bound with at least one Cy3.5-eIF4A molecule. The presence of 40 nM Cy3.5-eIF4A in the delivery mixture also moderately stimulated the overall 43S PIC recruitment efficiency ( Figure S1 L), potentially via direct interaction with the 43S PIC components. Supporting this hypothesis, we observed FRET between Cy5-ybbR-eIF4A and Cy3-uS19-40S subunit (the 40S was also covalently labeled with biotin at the N terminus of Asc1p and tethered on the imaging surface) ( Figures S2 H and S2I). Thus, eIF4A can directly contact the 40S subunit. ATP hydrolysis by eIF4A was required for stable interactions with the 40S subunit (mean FRET lifetime = 8 s with ATP versus <0.2 s with non-hydrolyzable ADPNP) ( Figure S2 J). The eIF4A binding site (within FRET distance to uS19) was near the eIF4B binding site on the 40S ( Figure S2 K; Walker et al., 2013 68. Walker, S.E. ∙ Zhou, F. ∙ Mitchell, S.F. ... Yeast eIF4B binds to the head of the 40S ribosomal subunit and promotes mRNA recruitment through its N-terminal and internal repeat domains RNA. 2013; 19 :191-207 Crossref Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ), and addition of eIF4B to this reaction did not alter the eIF4A-40S interaction dynamics ( Figures S2 L and S2M).
Together, these results suggest that the stimulatory effects of eIF4A on 43S PIC recruitment may require its interactions with both the mRNA and the 40S subunit.
In the real-time initiation assays with tethered mRNAs, changes in concentrations of eIF4A (0.1–6 μM) or 60S (100–200 nM) had only minor effects on 60S joining (∼30 s), whereas omitting Ded1p slowed 60S joining by nearly 2-fold (∼60 s) ( Figures S1 C and S1E). These concentration changes did not affect the transition from initiation to elongation ( Figures S1 C and S1E), consistent with eIF5B governing this step ( Wang et al., 2019 69. Wang, J. ∙ Johnson, A.G. ∙ Lapointe, C.P. ... eIF5B gates the transition from translation initiation to elongation Nature. 2019; 573 :605-608 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar , 2020 70. Wang, J. ∙ Wang, J. ∙ Shin, B.-S. ... Structural basis for the transition from translation initiation to elongation by an 80S-eIF5B complex Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :5003 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ). Collectively, the RNA helicases eIF4A and Ded1p plausibly play different roles in regulating the rate-limiting steps between 43S-mRNA binding and 60S joining, i.e., scanning, and/or rearrangements post scanning ( Figure 1 C), consistent with the distinct roles of these helicases in vivo ( Sen et al., 2015 53. Sen, N.D. ∙ Zhou, F. ∙ Ingolia, N.T. ... Genome-wide analysis of translational efficiency reveals distinct but overlapping functions of yeast DEAD-box RNA helicases Ded1 and eIF4A Genome Res. 2015; 25 :1196-1205 Crossref Scopus (114) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To dissect these early steps of initiation and to observe scanning directly, we established a FRET signal ( Figures 2 A and 2B) between the Cy5-labeled C terminus of uS5 (at the 40S mRNA entry channel) and a Cy3-dye located 3′ of the AUG (position +20, with A of the AUG as 0), outside of the ribosomal binding site at the start codon. The distance between these sites should decrease during scanning and the FRET efficiency ( E FRET ) therefore reports on the relative 40S location on the flexible mRNA polymer ( Figure S3 A). Combined with the uS19-uL18 inter-ribosomal subunit FRET, these two orthogonal FRET signals from a single ribosome would differentiate between the scanning and post-scanning states ( Figure 2 A).
Using a similar reaction scheme and condition as above ( Figure S1 A, scheme 2, at 6 μM eIF4A concentration), we observed rapid 43S recruitment as expected (mean time ∼3.8 s), typified by the burst of the Cy3.5-uS19 signal from direct excitation by a 532-nm laser ( Figures 2 C, S3 B, and S3C). After 43S recruitment, there was a brief lag (∼0.3 s, mean scanning time) until the Cy3–Cy5 E FRET reached its maximum. This was followed by another dwell time (∼29 s, mean post-scanning state lifetime) before 60S joining, signaled by the appearance of the Cy3.5-uS19 to Cy5.5-uL18 inter-subunit FRET. Relative to the above setup ( Figure 1 ), this experimental scheme resulted in a similar timescale of 60S joining after 43S recruitment (∼0.3 + 29 s) to that determined above (∼30 s) and suggested that scanning on the RPL30 mRNA was rapid (∼0.3 s).
We next measured scanning times over a wide range of yeast 5′ UTR lengths ( Tuller et al., 2009 63. Tuller, T. ∙ Ruppin, E. ∙ Kupiec, M. Properties of untranslated regions of the S. cerevisiae genome BMC Genomics. 2009; 10 :391 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ). We mutated the RPL30 mRNA to contain three tandem repeats of the native RPL30 5′ UTR or the native 5′ UTRs of SFT2 or PMA1 genes ( Figure 2 D). The mean scanning time increased linearly with the 5′ UTR length, corresponding to a scanning rate of 145 (95% confidence interval [CI] range 96–297) nt⋅s −1 ( Figure 2 E). By contrast, mean post-scanning state lifetime and 5′ UTR length were not correlated ( Figure S3 D).
The roughly linear relationship between scanning time and the number of nucleotides scanned by the ribosome was also observed within the PMA1 mRNA when the Cy3-dye was installed at varying positions within the 5′ UTR using Cy3-DNA oligonucleotides, corresponding to a scanning rate of 141 (95% CI range 103–223) nt⋅s −1 ( Figures S3 E–S3G). Interestingly, the anti-sense DNA oligonucleotide was not dislodged during scanning ( Figures S3 H and S3I) and instead led to stalling of the scanning ribosomes ( Figure S3 J). These experiments also suggested that the 43S landing site was close to the 5′ end of the mRNA, as mRNA-uS5 FRET was observed with the donor dye on the mRNA positioned proximal to the 5′ end while distal to the start site.
To obtain more robust mechanistic details about the scanning process, we examined FRET solely between uS5-Cy5-40S and Cy3-mRNA (Cy3 at position +20) to eliminate fluorescence crosstalk from other dyes ( Figures 3 A and 3B; Chen et al., 2014 11. Chen, J. ∙ Dalal, R.V. ∙ Petrov, A.N. ... High-throughput platform for real-time monitoring of biological processes by multicolor single-molecule fluorescence Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111 :664-669 Crossref Scopus (101) PubMed Google Scholar ). E FRET versus time trajectories revealed a multi-frame ramp of E FRET (mean lifetime ∼0.30 s) at the beginning of the FRET events before reaching the maximal E FRET (∼0.48) on RPL30 mRNA ( Figures 3 C–3H). The ramp was more evident with PMA1 mRNA (mean lifetime ∼0.58 s; Figures S4 A and S4B). Similar results were obtained at an increased movie frame rate (30 fps; Figures S4 C–S4F), indicating that the observed FRET ramp was not an artifact of slow data acquisition. The mean ramp lifetime was similar to the scanning time measured above for RPL30 , suggesting that the 43S landing site on RPL30 corresponded to a distance that would allow rapid appearance of mRNA-uS5 FRET; whereas on PMA1 , the ramp time was a fraction of the scanning time, consistent with 43S landing near the 5′ end of the mRNA and thus starting scanning from a position too distant for mRNA-uS5 FRET ( Figure S4 M).
With the Cy3 dye on the mRNA at position +20, a small fraction of the FRET traces (∼11% for RPL30 and ∼14% for PMA1 ) displayed E FRET transitions between the maximum level and a lower non-zero state ( Figures S4 N and S4O). Thus, 40S scanning is globally 5′ to 3′ unidirectional, with some occasional short-lived backward (3′–5′) movements (mean lifetime ∼2 s, Figure S4 P), as suggested by lower mRNA-uS5 FRET levels (more below). When the Cy3-DNA oligonucleotides were annealed within the 5′ UTR of PMA1 , the fraction of traces with E FRET transitions increased with the distance between the 5′ cap to the Cy3 dye ( Figure S4 Q), suggesting that the directionality of scanning might become more promiscuous as the 43S PIC moves along the 5′ UTR.
To test if the rapid and directional scanning was driven by rounds of eIF4A-ATP hydrolysis, we first varied eIF4A concentrations in the experiments with the PMA1 mRNA. With eIF4A concentrations ranging from 0.6 to 6 μM, the E FRET ramp remained largely the same ( Figures S4 G–S4J), indicating that once a 43S PIC is loaded onto a mRNA, its scanning time is independent of eIF4A concentration. The scanning time determined in the four-color assay ( Figure 2 A) remained similar when sub-saturating ATP concentrations (0.1 or 0.04 mM) ( Lorsch and Herschlag, 1998 39. Lorsch, J.R. ∙ Herschlag, D. The DEAD box protein eIF4A. 1. A minimal kinetic and thermodynamic framework reveals coupled binding of RNA and nucleotide Biochemistry. 1998; 37 :2180-2193 Crossref Scopus (175) PubMed Google Scholar ) or a mixture of 0.5 mM ATP and ATPγS were used in place of 1 mM ATP ( Figure 3 I). These results suggest that, once loaded, 43S scanning does not require multiple cycles of ATP hydrolysis by eIF4A. The scanning time remained the same when eIF4 proteins were instead co-delivered with the ribosomal components to immobilized RPL30 mRNAs ( Figure S4 R), suggesting that a similar scanning pathway is involved, regardless of whether the mRNA is pre-incubated with eIF4 proteins. At a lower temperature (20°C), scanning was more heterogeneous on PMA1 mRNA, with more ribosomes taking a slower path to the final FRET state and the mean ramp lifetime increased to ∼1.4 s ( Figures S4 K and S4L).
To determine how scanning is regulated by 5′ UTR secondary structures, we engineered RPL30 mRNA to contain a stable hairpin stem-loop (SL 52.1 in mRNA-SL 52.1 -46, Figure 4 A, ΔG mfe = −52.1 kcal/mol at 30°C; Zuker, 2003 74. Zuker, M. Mfold web server for nucleic acid folding and hybridization prediction Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31 :3406-3415 Crossref Scopus (10980) PubMed Google Scholar ). With SL 52.1 located 60 nt from the 5′ end and 46 nt upstream of the start codon, the two-color mRNA-uS5 FRET revealed a similar E FRET ramp as observed for RPL30 , without significant stalling of the scanning ribosomes (Cy3-dye at position +20, Figures 4 B and 4C). In the four-color scanning assay ( Figure 2 A), this hairpin structure had moderate effects on 43S recruitment and 60S joining ( Figures S5 C and S5E). The mean scanning time (∼1.5 s) corresponded to a speed of 101 ± 13 nt⋅s −1 ( Figure S5 D), ∼30% slower than that determined above for scanning on 5′ UTRs without highly stable structures. The stable SL 52.1 in the middle of the 5′ UTR thus slowed the scanning ribosomes, albeit slightly.
Previous analyses in yeast suggested larger translational inhibitory effects of 5′ UTR secondary structures located proximal rather than distal to the start site ( Cuperus et al., 2017 15. Cuperus, J.T. ∙ Groves, B. ∙ Kuchina, A. ... Deep learning of the regulatory grammar of yeast 5′ untranslated regions from 500,000 random sequences Genome Res. 2017; 27 :2015-2024 Crossref Scopus (118) PubMed Google Scholar ). We thus moved SL 52.1 closer to the AUG codon (mRNA-SL 52.1 -6; Figure 4 A). Cy3-mRNA to uS5-Cy5 FRET also rapidly arrived at a high FRET state, but ∼80% of the FRET traces displayed discrete fluctuations (average ∼3 cycles) between the high (∼0.47) and a low (∼0.18) FRET state ( Figures 4 D, 4E, 4H, 4I, and S5 A). When SL 52.1 was replaced with lower-stability RNA structures (−28.5 kcal/mol or lower; Figure 4 A), similar FRET fluctuations were observed, but with reduced frequencies ( Figures 4 F–4I). Thus, scanning fluctuations were modulated by mRNA secondary structure stability near the start codon.
We hypothesized that in these experiments, the high FRET state correlated with the 43S at the AUG site, consistent with 43S scanning through the hairpin; fluctuation to the low FRET state (with abrupt state transitions, Figure S5 J) reflected backward (3′–5′) 43S movement induced by the hairpin sequence; and the following transition to a high FRET state indicated “rescanning” by the 43S to the AUG site. In agreement with this interpretation, an unlabeled DNA oligonucleotide blocking the start site suppressed the high FRET state with mRNA-SL 52.1 -6 ( Figures S5 A and S5B), whereas scanning 43S fluctuations were rare when the AUG codon was located in the loop of a stable hairpin structure ( Figures S5 A and S5B). Replacing GTP with the non-hydrolysable analog GDPCP did not alter the fluctuation dynamics ( Figures S5 F and S5G), indicating that the fluctuations can occur prior to GTP hydrolysis by eIF2.
During the ribosomal fluctuations induced by hairpin structures, higher FRET states (beyond ∼0.47 of the AUG state) were not observed ( Figure S5 A), suggesting that the ribosomal fluctuations do not occur from the AUG site toward the 3′ direction or that the 3′ directional fluctuations were too transient to be detected by our smFRET signals (temporal resolution 100 ms). To rule out potential biases caused by the placement of the Cy3-DNA oligonucleotide at position +20 on mRNA-SL 52.1 -6, we moved the DNA to position +55, which is further away from the mRNA entry site on the 40S. Two FRET states were observed, a ∼0.32 FRET state that corresponded to the AUG state and a ∼0.11 FRET state with the 43S located upstream of the AUG site ( Figure S5 U), confirming our previous results. Next, we reasoned that if the 43S PIC would fluctuate toward the 3′ direction beyond the start site, it should be captured by a nearby downstream AUG codon and lead to a detectable higher FRET state (>0.32). We thus inserted a second AUG codon 22-nt to the 3′ of the original start site in mRNA-SL 12.2 -6 and repeated the 2-color FRET assay with the Cy3-DNA annealed to the original +55 position ( Figure S5 T). Again, we only observed the ∼0.13 and ∼0.32 FRET states ( Figure S5 U), with no evidence of any higher FRET states. Together, these results indicate that ribosomal fluctuation from the AUG site to the 3′ direction is unlikely to occur.
With the Cy3-dye at position +20 on the mRNAs, the low FRET state lifetimes increased with hairpin stability ( Figure S5 H), consistent with increased free energies to rescan through the hairpins. Lowering the reaction temperature to 20°C led to a >2-fold increase in the low FRET state lifetimes with mRNA-SL 52.1 -6 ( Figure S5 F), consistent with increased hairpin stability at lower temperature. Reducing ATP concentration from 1 to 0.1 mM resulted in a ∼1.7-fold increase in the low FRET state lifetimes, without changing the high FRET state lifetimes ( Figures S5 F and S5G). Decreasing eIF4A concentration from 6 to 0.6 μM also prolonged the low FRET state lifetimes ( Figures S5 F and S5G). Thus, multiple cycles of ATP hydrolysis and rebinding of eIF4A promote the resumption of 43S scanning toward the 3′ direction during the fluctuations induced by stable hairpins.
With more stable hairpin structures, fewer ribosomes stabilized at the high FRET state, as shown by the less populated high FRET state ( Figures S5 K–S5R) and substantially reduced high FRET state lifetimes ( Figure S5 I). Consistently, both the 60S joining efficiencies and rates were reduced as a function of hairpin stability in the real-time initiation assay ( Figures 4 J and S5 E). Although Ded1p had minor effects on the ribosomal fluctuations ( Figures S5 L–S5O), it stimulated the 60S joining efficiencies with the structured mRNAs ( Figure S5 E), which is likely linked to its role in shortening the post-scanning 60S joining time as observed above for RPL30 mRNA ( Figure S1 E).
Initiation can occur at near-cognate start codons (e.g., CUG and UUG), but at relatively low levels, and can be stimulated by downstream hairpin structures ( Kearse and Wilusz, 2017 31. Kearse, M.G. ∙ Wilusz, J.E. Non-AUG translation: a new start for protein synthesis in eukaryotes Genes Dev. 2017; 31 :1717-1731 Crossref Scopus (243) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kozak, 1990 34. Kozak, M. Downstream secondary structure facilitates recognition of initiator codons by eukaryotic ribosomes Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1990; 87 :8301-8305 Crossref Scopus (418) PubMed Google Scholar ). We deployed a single-molecule assay ( Figures 5 A–5D) to distinguish initiation at a near-cognate codon (within 5′ UTR) and the AUG codon, by FRET between Cy3-60S and the first elongator tRNA of the two reading frames (Cy5.5-Phe-tRNA Phe for AUG and Cy5-Lys-tRNA Lys for CUG or UUG) ( Figure S6 A). In the absence of a stable hairpin (mRNA CUG-SL 0 -AUG), initiation at the upstream CUG (within optimal surrounding context) accounted for ∼15% of all the initiation events. Replacing SL 0 with the stable SL 52.1 hairpin increased the fraction of ribosomes initiated at the CUG codon to ∼88% ( Figure 5 E); a similar trend was observed with mRNAs containing an upstream UUG codon ( Figure 5 E). A mutant eIF1 (eIF1-C64A) that stimulated UUG initiation compared with wild-type (WT) eIF1 in yeast ( Figure S6 H) also substantially increased the CUG initiation efficiency in vitro ( Figure S6 I).
Next, we tested near-cognate initiation in our two-color scanning assay. With CUG-SL 0 -AUG mRNA, ∼12% of the mRNA-uS5 FRET trajectories showed only a long-lived (mean lifetime ∼124 s) low FRET state ( E FRET ∼ 0.17, Figures S6 B–S6D), presumably due to the scanning 43S PICs initiating at the CUG site during the first encounter. The rest of the trajectories displayed a high FRET state ( E FRET ∼ 0.50), either without fluctuation (∼64%) or fluctuated to the low FRET state but eventually stayed in a long-lived high FRET state (∼24%, and with the dominant slow phase, high FRET state lifetime at 127 ± 2 s) ( Figures 5 F, 5G, S6 D, and S6E). These likely reflected the 43S PICs that bypassed the upstream CUG codon and initiated at the AUG site.
With downstream SL 52.1 , the fraction of low FRET state-only trajectories increased to ∼21%, consistent with a higher energy barrier to unfold the hairpin by the scanning 43S PIC. However, these were insufficient to account for the ∼88% CUG initiation with this mRNA ( Figure 5 E). Most trajectories (∼77%) displayed FRET state fluctuations after reaching the high FRET state ( Figures 5 H and 5I), with the low FRET state lifetime being ∼3-fold longer than those observed above for mRNA-SL 52.1 -6 ( Figure S6 F), suppressing the occupancy of the high FRET state ( Figure S6 D). These trajectories plausibly correspond to scanning 43S PICs that bypassed the CUG codon on first passage and reached the AUG site, where the AUG site-proximal hairpin-induced ribosomal backtracking and fluctuations to increase the number of times a 43S PIC samples the upstream CUG codon, thus increasing CUG initiation. Consistent with a delay in initiation caused by ribosomal fluctuations on the mRNA, 60S binding events were ∼5-fold slower compared with CUG-SL 0 -AUG at both the CUG and AUG sites ( Figure S6 G). Moving the upstream CUG (or UUG) codon and SL 52.1 hairpin 40 nt away from the AUG site ( Figure 5 A), which abolishes the ribosomal fluctuations, decreased the magnitude of the stimulatory effect of the hairpin ( Figure 5 E).
To assess the impact of hairpin structures on near-cognate initiation in vivo , matching pairs of NanoLuc-PEST ( NlucP ) reporters were designed to monitor translation initiating from an upstream near-cognate start codon or a downstream AUG codon. Sequences encoding the self-cleaving 2A peptide from equine rhinitis B virus (ERBV-1, Souza-Moreira et al., 2018 61. Souza-Moreira, T.M. ∙ Navarrete, C. ∙ Chen, X. ... Screening of 2A peptides for polycistronic gene expression in yeast FEMS Yeast Res. 2018; 18 :36 Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar ) were inserted upstream of NlucP to ensure that the same reporter protein was produced from all reporters, and all yeast strains used in these studies lack UPF1 ( He et al., 1993 26. He, F. ∙ Peltz, S.W. ∙ Donahue, J.L. ... Stabilization and ribosome association of unspliced pre-mRNAs in a yeast upf1- mutant Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Temperature-dependent regulation of upstream open reading frame translation in S. cerevisiae BMC Biol. 2019; 17 :101 Crossref Scopus (10) PubMed Google Scholar ) to block nonsense-mediated mRNA decay that might be triggered by translation of upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in reporters containing additional near-cognate or cognate start sites. Introduction of the SL 52.1 hairpin 6 nt upstream of the AUG start codon in a construct lacking the upstream near-cognate start codon reduced translation by nearly 99% ( Figure S7 A), consistent with previous studies in yeast ( Baim and Sherman, 1988 7.

On the other hand, a weaker −9.2 kcal/mol hairpin (SL 9.2 , differs from SL 8.9 by one nucleotide to avoid near-cognate codons in the hairpin; Figure 6 A) decreased the translation efficiency to ∼50% ( Figure S7 A), thus preserving sufficient quantitative range to assess the impact of the hairpin on upstream near-cognate and downstream AUG initiation.
Consistent with the original in vitro studies by Kozak (1990) 34. Kozak, M. Downstream secondary structure facilitates recognition of initiator codons by eukaryotic ribosomes Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1990; 87 :8301-8305 Crossref Scopus (418) PubMed Google Scholar and related mammalian cell studies ( Clyde and Harris, 2006 14. Clyde, K. ∙ Harris, E. RNA secondary structure in the coding region of dengue virus Type 2 directs translation start codon selection and is required for viral replication J. Virol. 2006; 80 :2170-2182 Crossref Scopus (150) PubMed Google Scholar ) showing secondary structure promoting initiation at an upstream weak start site, we found that in yeast cells, SL 9.2 enhanced NlucP translation from a near-cognate CUG ( Figure 6 B) or UUG ( Figure S7 B) start site located 15 nt upstream of the base of the stem. Notably, this stimulatory effect was observed in multiple WT ( upf1Δ ) strains and in an eIF4E ( cdc33 ) mutant ( Figure 6 B). Our single-molecule assay ( Figure S7 C) also demonstrated that SL 9.2 enhanced upstream CUG initiation by 3-fold while reducing by 5-fold initiation from the AUG codon located 6 nt to the 3′ of the hairpin ( Figure 6 C). When the AUG site was displaced 40-nt further downstream by a spacer sequence, the stimulation of translation from upstream near-cognate start codons was maintained in vivo , although the stimulatory effects were not uniform across different yeast strains ( Figure 6 B); whereas these effects were moderately weakened in vitro ( Figure 6 C).

Perspect. Biol. 2019; 11 :a032706 Crossref Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ), the dynamic scanning motion of the 43S ribosome on a mRNA has not been directly observed. Our single-molecule fluorescence approaches quantitatively monitor translation initiation directly as it unfolds from 43S-mRNA binding through scanning and 60S subunit joining, providing a foundation to understand its regulation ( Figure 7 ).
Efficient 43S recruitment to capped mRNAs requires the activation of mRNAs by eIF4F proteins, in particular eIF4A and its ATP hydrolysis ( Figures 1 E and S1 F), perhaps through the unwinding of the mRNA structures either locally around the 40S landing site or globally throughout the entire sequence ( Yourik et al., 2017 72. Yourik, P. ∙ Aitken, C.E. ∙ Zhou, F. ... Yeast eIF4A enhances recruitment of mRNAs regardless of their structural complexity eLife. 2017; 6 :e31476 Crossref Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ). Supporting the latter scenario, we observed co-occupancy of multiple eIF4A molecules on a single RPL30 mRNA (507 nt in length) at different locations (up to ∼30 copies assuming that labeled and unlabeled eIF4A proteins behave the same, and there is no negative cooperativity for eIF4A-mRNA interaction at high occupancy, Figures S2 D and S2E). This provides a potential rationale for the high abundance of eIF4A in cells (>10 μM) and impaired global translation with reduced eIF4A concentrations ( Firczuk et al., 2013 17. Firczuk, H. ∙ Kannambath, S. ∙ Pahle, J. ... An in vivo control map for the eukaryotic mRNA translation machinery Mol. Syst. Biol. 2013; 9 :635 Crossref Scopus (73) PubMed Google Scholar ; Merrick and Pavitt, 2018 42. Merrick, W.C. ∙ Pavitt, G.D. Protein synthesis initiation in eukaryotic cells Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2018; 10 :a033092 Crossref Scopus (208) PubMed Google Scholar ). By contrast, the more effective RNA helicase Ded1p ( Gao et al., 2016 18. Gao, Z. ∙ Putnam, A.A. ∙ Bowers, H.A. ... Coupling between the DEAD-box RNA helicases Ded1p and eIF4A eLife. 2016; 5 :e16408 Crossref Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ) was unable to promote 40S-mRNA binding in the absence of eIF4A, implying that the RNA helicase activity alone is insufficient to drive initiation. This is consistent with the general role of eIF4A in stimulating the translation of all mRNAs, whereas Ded1p specifically stimulates the translation of a subset of mRNAs ( Sen et al., 2019 54. Sen, N.D. ∙ Gupta, N. ∙ K Archer, S. ... Functional interplay between DEAD-box RNA helicases Ded1 and Dbp1 in preinitiation complex attachment and scanning on structured mRNAs in vivo Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 :8785-8806 PubMed Google Scholar ). We also observed direct contact of eIF4A with the 40S subunit, in a region near the previously reported eIF4B binding site ( Figures S2 H–S2M; Walker et al., 2013 68. Walker, S.E. ∙ Zhou, F. ∙ Mitchell, S.F. ... Yeast eIF4B binds to the head of the 40S ribosomal subunit and promotes mRNA recruitment through its N-terminal and internal repeat domains RNA. 2013; 19 :191-207 Crossref Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ). Such interactions may modulate the 40S conformation to mechanically aid mRNA loading within the 40S mRNA binding cleft ( Sokabe and Fraser, 2017 59. Sokabe, M. ∙ Fraser, C.S. A helicase-independent activity of eIF4A in promoting mRNA recruitment to the human ribosome Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :6304-6309 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ). The role of the 5′ cap and other eIF4F components in biasing loading near the 5′ end of a canonical mRNA will require further investigation.
Recruiting a second 43S PIC to an mRNA bound with a leading 48S PIC or 80S IC at the start site also requires the eIF4F-mRNA activation step. Differing from recruitment of the first 43S PIC bound to the mRNA, the second 43S PIC occupancy time on the mRNA was ∼20-fold shorter ( Figure S2 C), perhaps due to improper accommodation of the mRNA on the second 43S PIC. This also implies that the global conformations of the 48S PIC and 80S IC are non-optimal for the recruitment of a second 43S PIC to the mRNA. The efficiency of the second 43S PIC loading was higher with the 80S IC than with the 48S ( Figure S2 B), possibly related to the successive dissociation of eIFs during the late stages of initiation ( Wagner et al., 2020 67. Wagner, S. ∙ Herrmannová, A. ∙ Hronová, V. ... Selective translation complex profiling reveals staged initiation and co-translational assembly of initiation factor complexes Mol. Cell. 2020; 79 :546-560.e7 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (76) PubMed Google Scholar ). Elongation by the 80S may also contribute to setting the stage for the next round of initiation.
Once loaded onto the mRNA, 43S scanning through yeast 5′ UTRs is immediate and rapid (∼100 nt⋅s −1 ) and may be strongly coupled to loading. The 43S PIC landing site on the mRNA is near the 5′ end, and once engaged with the mRNA, it is critical for the 40S subunit to commit to scanning and subsequent initiation, as failures would lead to stable stalled complexes ( Figures S3 H–S3J), sequestering the 40S subunits and bound eIFs on an mRNA. Fast scanning represents a technical challenge to our single-molecule FRET approach (30-ms temporal resolution) for obtaining nucleotide-resolution information on its directionality. Nonetheless, our results indicate that scanning is globally 5′ to 3′ unidirectional, with a finite low propensity to backward movement ( Figure 3 ). The scanning motion does not rely on multiple rounds of eIF4A-ATP hydrolysis after loading and is independent of Ded1p. What governs the scanning speed and directionality remains to be established, but the data presented here cannot rule out a biased diffusional mechanism over the relatively short 5′ UTR distances that must be scanned by an initiating yeast ribosome ( Vassilenko et al., 2011 65. Vassilenko, K.S. ∙ Alekhina, O.M. ∙ Dmitriev, S.E. ... Unidirectional constant rate motion of the ribosomal scanning particle during eukaryotic translation initiation Nucleic Acids Res. 2011; 39 :5555-5567 Crossref Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the linear dependence of scanning with the range of 5′ UTR lengths tested here suggests a constant velocity and thus energy usage. More heterogeneous trajectories of scanning were observed at lower temperature ( Figure S4 K), suggesting that scanning is modulated by energy barriers, e.g., RNA structures in the 5′ UTR. Scanning may be directly coupled to the energy expenditure by eIF4A during 43S PIC recruitment, and the 5′ to 3′ directionality may be linked to the 43S-mRNA binding energy. Consistent with this notion, scanning ribosomes are more prone to backtracking as the 43S PIC scans along the 5′ UTR ( Figure S4 Q). Similar scanning rates were observed when the mRNA was pre-incubated with eIF4 proteins or not ( Figure S4 R), suggesting that the same 43S PIC recruitment and scanning processes are involved in both reaction schemes once a threshold behavior of eIF4F is achieved. Finally, eIF3 (and perhaps also eIF4F proteins) bound at the mRNA exit site may bias 5′ to 3′ ribosomal movement ( Brito Querido et al., 2020 9. Brito Querido, J.B. ∙ Sokabe, M. ∙ Kraatz, S. ... Structure of a human 48S translational initiation complex Science. 2020; 369 :1220-1227 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ).
Scanning is not rate-limiting in initiation under normal conditions with unstructured 5′ UTRs. After rapid 43S scanning to the start site, a relatively long delay (post-scanning state, ∼30 s to minutes) to 60S joining occurs ( Figure S3 C), which limits the overall initiation rate. During this period, the ribosomal complex likely undergoes conformational and compositional rearrangements, leading to stable initiator tRNA anticodon-start codon interactions before commitment to the final stages of initiation. The 40S head domain moves from the open to the closed conformation to fully accommodate the anticodon loop of the initiator tRNA at the start codon ( Llácer et al., 2015 38. Llácer, J.L. ∙ Hussain, T. ∙ Marler, L. ... Conformational differences between open and closed states of the eukaryotic translation initiation complex Mol. Cell. 2015; 59 :399-412 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (157) PubMed Google Scholar ); eIF2 must hydrolyze GTP and dissociate from the ribosome to enable eIF5B recruitment and subsequent 60S joining ( Algire et al., 2005 2. Algire, M.A. ∙ Maag, D. ∙ Lorsch, J.R. Pi release from eIF2, not GTP hydrolysis, is the step controlled by start-site selection during eukaryotic translation initiation Mol. Cell. 2005; 20 :251-262 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (194) PubMed Google Scholar ), and eIF3 configurations have also been shown to remodel upon start codon recognition ( Llácer et al., 2021 37.

The presence of Ded1p shortened this delay by ∼2-fold ( Figure S3 C), plausibly through its interplay with eIF4F proteins, the 40S ribosome, and the mRNA ( Gao et al., 2016 18.

This is consistent with prior evidence that its human homolog, DDX3, assists 60S joining to assemble functional 80S ribosomes ( Geissler et al., 2012 19. Geissler, R. ∙ Golbik, R.P. ∙ Behrens, S.E.

5′ UTR secondary structures play a surprising role in scanning. Here, we demonstrate that in vitro , scanning ribosomes readily melt mRNA hairpin structures up to −52.1 kcal/mol in stability in the 5′ UTR upon first encounter to reach the start site rapidly ( Figure 4 ). However, when the stable hairpin is located adjacent to the start codon, the ribosome remains at the start site for only a short period (∼3 s, Figure S5 I); subsequent backward motion (3′–5′) and fluctuations between the upstream position and the start site impair 60S joining ( Figure 4 J). The frequency of such fluctuations plateaued with hairpin stabilities above −12.2 kcal/mol ( Figures 4 H and 4I). This provides a rationale for the underrepresented (∼1%) secondary structures with stability above −12.2 kcal/mol in a 50-nt window in yeast 5′ UTRs ( Ringné and Krogh, 2005 51. Ringné, M. ∙ Krogh, M. Folding free energies of 5′-UTRs impact post-transcriptional regulation on a genomic scale in yeast PLoS Comput. Biol. 2005; 1 :e72 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) and explains why secondary structures immediately upstream of the start site (positions −40 to −1) are selected against in yeast ( Robbins-Pianka et al., 2010 52. Robbins-Pianka, A. ∙ Rice, M.D. ∙ Weir, M.P. ... The mRNA landscape at yeast translation initiation sites Bioinformatics. 2010; 26 :2651-2655 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Fluctuations are induced by hairpin structures that are unfolded within the 40S subunit mRNA binding channel. The hairpin-induced 3′–5′ movement of the 40S can occur prior to GTP hydrolysis by eIF2 ( Figures S5 F and S5G) during the long waiting period for 60S subunit joining. Reverse movement of the 40S subunit may be the result of hairpin refolding on the ribosome near the mRNA exit channel, leading to steric clashes with eIF3 (and perhaps eIF4F) components ( Llácer et al., 2015 38.

Structure of a human 48S translational initiation complex Science. 2020; 369 :1220-1227 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) and thus biasing the 40S subunit to positions upstream (5′) of the hairpin. Moving the hairpin further upstream of the AUG diminished this regulatory effect ( Figures 4 A–4C); in this case, the ribosomal occupancy on the unfolded hairpin is transient (<0.5 s) due to the rapid rate (∼100 nt⋅s -1 ) of scanning to the downstream start codon, leading to a low probability of hairpin refolding on the ribosome. The high-to-low uS5-mRNA FRET transitions were nearly instantaneous ( Figure S5 J), suggesting abrupt 40S backward movement to upstream of the hairpin coupled to rapid two-state hairpin refolding and thus reduced 40S occupancies within the hairpin sequence. Fluctuations were suppressed when the start codon was in a hairpin loop ( Figures S5 A and S5B) since refolding of the mRNA could not occur 5′ to the start site in this case. Consistent with these observations, re-analysis of the human 40S ribosome profiling data (too sparse data for yeast due to generally unstructured 5′ UTRs) ( Archer et al., 2016 5.

Scanning 43S PICs in our single-molecule assays largely bypassed (∼85%) upstream near-cognate CUG codons, even within the optimal sequence context ( Figures 5 E and 6 C), consistent with the low in vivo efficiencies of initiation at near-cognate start codons ( Figure 6 B; Baim and Sherman, 1988 7.

Loughran, G. ∙ Zhdanov, A.V. ∙ Mikhaylova, M.S. ... Unusually efficient CUG initiation of an overlapping reading frame in POLG mRNA yields novel protein POLGARF Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2020; 117 :24936-24946 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ). Stable hairpin structures enhance initiation at upstream near-cognate codons both in vitro and in vivo ( Figures 5 and 6 ). Two plausible mechanisms can explain the observed in vitro results. First, the increase in activation energy required to unwind the downstream hairpin during forward scanning increases the fraction of 43S PICs that settle and initiate at the near-cognate codon upon first encounter ( Figures S6 B and S6C; Kozak, 1990 34. Kozak, M. Downstream secondary structure facilitates recognition of initiator codons by eukaryotic ribosomes Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1990; 87 :8301-8305 Crossref Scopus (418) PubMed Google Scholar ). This is also the predominant mechanism by which SL 9.2 stimulates upstream near-cognate initiation in vivo ( Figures 6 B and S7 B). Second, when the 5′ UTR hairpin is proximal to the AUG codon, scanning 43S PICs that reach the AUG site are driven backward and fluctuate ( Figures 5 H and 5I), enhancing upstream near-cognate initiation efficiency by increasing the number of times a ribosome encounters and resides at the near-cognate start codon during the delayed period of initiation ( Figures 5 E and 6 C).
Our study establishes a quantitative mechanistic framework of eukaryotic translation initiation ( Figure 7 ), and the dynamic mechanisms unraveled here will guide future efforts on human translation to understand translational control in health and disease.
Here, we show that preincubating eIF4 proteins with the mRNA hastens 43S PIC recruitment, and this stimulatory effect is strictly dependent on ATP hydrolysis by eIF4A. Although our results revealed direct interactions of eIF4A with the mRNA and with the 40S, future studies are required to understand fully how eIF4A (and eIF4F as a whole) promotes rapid association of the 43S PIC with the mRNA, and what is the role of multiple copies of these initiation factors on a single mRNA in this process.
Our smFRET approaches are limited to 30–100 ms temporal resolution and thus will miss the dynamics occurring at a faster timescale. We cannot rule out rapid bi-directional movements of the 43S PIC at single nucleotide resolution, despite our data suggesting global 5′ to 3′ directional scanning. The precision of the scanning time/speed measurements are also limited, due to the fast-scanning motion, as well as the unknown landing site of the 43S PIC on the mRNA. Nevertheless, our results demonstrate that scanning is happening at a speed of about 100 nt⋅s −1 and is not the rate-limiting step in initiation. To distinguish biased diffusion from motor-driven scanning, we will need to explore a much greater length distribution of 5′ UTRs, which is technically challenging. Finally, all smFRET studies suffer from the measurement of, at best, a single distance in a complex three-dimensional system. Increased observables are needed to define scanning and other conformational changes in greater detail.
We observed scanning ribosome fluctuations between the AUG site and the upstream (5′) site, and we propose that the fluctuations are coupled to the folding/unfolding of the hairpins on the ribosome. Future studies are needed to test this hypothesis and explain why such fluctuations are restricted to only toward the 5′ direction and what occurs to initiation complex composition during these fluctuations.
As is generally the case for in vitro single-molecule fluorescence methods, our quantifications of the number of molecules proceeding to the next stage of the reaction can be convoluted by the incomplete labeling of the components, as well as imperfect fluorophore photophysical behaviors. The fluorescently labeled elongator tRNAs we used to score for the initiation reading frames were from bacterial sources, which might be non-optimal for decoding the Lys or Phe codons on the yeast ribosomes and thus could introduce biases to the quantification. Nonetheless, we expect similar levels of such noises in the same type of assay with different mRNA constructs, thus the trend of effects observed here should be valid.
Our in vitro data suggest that the distance between the 5′ UTR hairpin and the AUG codon is critical for inducing scanning ribosome fluctuations to impair AUG initiation and to stimulate upstream near-cognate initiation. The in vivo effects of the spacing were not uniform among different yeast strains, preventing a coherent conclusion and suggesting another layer of regulation that is not well understood. We also believe that caution should be taken as the reporter expression levels represent the steady-state translation outcomes of the various constructs, which will not only be affected by scanning efficiencies but also by other steps of translation which are known to be influenced by mRNA structures.

To express Pab1p or Hcr1p, the plasmid pTYB2-Pab1p (Addgene #37234) or pTYB2-HCR1 (Addgene #37233) were transformed into Escherichia coli Rosetta2 (DE3) cells (Novagen), and the proteins were purified as previously described ( Mitchell et al., 2010 43.

To express full-length Ded1p, the DED1 gene was PCR-amplified from yeast genomic DNA using Phusion DNA polymerase and cloned into a pET28c plasmid for the expression of a recombinant 6×His-MBP-TEV protease site-Ded1p fusion protein. The resulting plasmid was transformed into Rosetta 2(DE3) cells and overexpressed by induction at an OD 600nm = 0.5 with 1 mM IPTG at 16°C for 16 hours. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 12 min and stored at -80°C after liquid nitrogen freezing.
For yeast ribosomal subunits, we have previously labeled and characterized the ybbR-tagged yeast 40S subunit (at the N-terminus of uS19, strain yJFW11) and 60S subunit (at the C-terminus of uL18, strain yJFW204) ( Wang et al., 2019 69. Wang, J. ∙ Johnson, A.G. ∙ Lapointe, C.P. ... eIF5B gates the transition from translation initiation to elongation Nature. 2019; 573 :605-608 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, for double tagging and labeling of the 40S subunit, the S6 tag (amino acid sequence of GDSLSWLLRLLN) was genetically fused to the N-terminus of uS19 using the same strategy as described for the ybbR tagging of uS19. The resulting yeast strain was transformed with a double stranded DNA carrying a URA3 cassette to tag the C-terminus of uS5 or the N-terminus of Asc1p with the A1 tag (amino acid sequence of GDSLDMLEWSLM) via homologous recombination using standard PCR-based methods ( Puig et al., 1998 49. Puig, O. ∙ Rutz, B. ∙ Luukkonen, B.G. ... New constructs and strategies for efficient PCR-based gene manipulations in yeast Yeast. 1998; 14 :1139-1146 Crossref Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ), and selected on SC-His-URA plates (referred to as strain yJFW268 or yJFW196).
In yeast reporter assays, to suppress nonsense mediated decay (NMD) potentially triggered by uORF translation, the upf1::HIS3 allele from strain HFY871 ( He et al., 1997 25. He, F. ∙ Brown, A.H. ∙ Jacobson, A. Upf1p, Nmd2p, and Upf3p are interacting components of the yeast nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17 :1580-1594 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) was amplified by PCR using primers UPF1-forward, 5'-GCATCTGGCGAACTCCGTAATTCG-3'; and UPF1-reverse, 5'-TGGTATCATTTTCTACAGCCATACC-3'. The PCR product was then used to knock out UPF1 in strains H5113, 334 (F694), and 349 (F695) generating strains J1748, J1746, and J1747, respectively.
Yeast translation factors eIFs 1, 1A, 2, 3, 4A, 4B, 4E, 4G, 5 and 5B, and eEFs 1A and 1Bα were prepared according to previously established methods ( Wang et al., 2019 69. Wang, J. ∙ Johnson, A.G. ∙ Lapointe, C.P. ... eIF5B gates the transition from translation initiation to elongation Nature. 2019; 573 :605-608 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ).

For fluorescent labeling of eIF4A, a ybbR tag (DSLEFIASKLA) was fused to the N-terminus of the protein. The protein encoding DNA was cloned into a pET28 vector such that the overexpressed protein had the following sequence: MGSSHHHHHHMENLYFQGM–ybbR–native eIF4A. The overexpression and purification of ybbR-eIF4A followed the same protocol as we previously described for that with untagged eIF4A ( Wang et al., 2019 69. Wang, J. ∙ Johnson, A.G. ∙ Lapointe, C.P. ... eIF5B gates the transition from translation initiation to elongation Nature. 2019; 573 :605-608 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ). To label ybbR-eIF4A with Cy3.5 or Cy5 dyes, 10 μM ybbR-eIF4A was mixed and incubated with 1 μM SFP synthase and 15 μM Cy3.5– or Cy5–CoA in a labeling buffer (50 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.5, 100 mM KOAc, 10 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM DTT) for 1 hr at room temperature. The free dyes were removed by running the sample through a 10DG column (Biorad, cat. 732-2010) following the manufacturer’s manual and with the column equilibrated with the protein storage buffer (50 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.5, 100 mM KOAc, 2 mM DTT and 10% glycerol). The labeled proteins were further purified on a SD75 gel filtration column with the storage buffer, flash frozen with liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C. The ATPase activities of the labeled proteins were verified by a malachite green assay as described ( Petrov et al., 2016 47. Petrov, A. ∙ Grosely, R. ∙ Chen, J. ...

To purify full-length Ded1p, cells were resuspended in 30 mL of lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol) supplemented with a cOmplete EDTA free protease inhibitor cocktail tablet (Roche) and lysed by sonication (MISONIX, 2 s on / 6 s off, 100 s total on time at 80% amplitude). The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 41,656 × g for 30 min at 4 °C in a F21-8×50y rotor (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The clarified lysate was loaded to a 2.5 mL Ni-NTA (Qiagen) gravity flow column equilibrated with lysis buffer. The column was washed with 50 mL wash buffer 1 (50 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.5, 1000 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol) and 20 mL wash buffer 2 (50 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol). Bound proteins were eluted with a buffer containing 50 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 200 mM imidazole and 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. The eluate was diluted with 4 volumes of buffer Q-A (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol) and loaded to a 5 mL HiTrap Q HP column equilibrated with buffer Q-AB (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol). The protein was eluted by applying an 80 mL linear gradient from 100% buffer Q-AB to 100% buffer Q-B (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol). The 6×His-MBP tag was cleaved with TEV protease and removed by flowing through the samples on a Ni-NTA column. The purified Ded1p was dialyzed twice against the storage buffer (10 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.3, 200 mM KOAc, 2 mM DTT, 50% glycerol) and stored at -80°C after liquid nitrogen freezing. The ATPase activity of the protein was verified by a malachite green assay as described ( Petrov et al., 2016 47. Petrov, A. ∙ Grosely, R. ∙ Chen, J. ... Multiple parallel pathways of translation initiation on the CrPV IRES Mol. Cell. 2016; 62 :92-103 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ). The RNA unwind activity of the protein was confirmed by a standard RNA/oligonucleotide unwinding assay with native polyacrylamide gel analyses ( Putnam et al., 2015 50. Putnam, A.A. ∙ Gao, Z. ∙ Liu, F. ... Division of labor in an oligomer of the DEAD-box RNA helicase Ded1p Mol. Cell. 2015; 59 :541-552 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Ribosome subunits were purified as previously described ( Wang et al., 2019 69. Wang, J. ∙ Johnson, A.G. ∙ Lapointe, C.P. ... eIF5B gates the transition from translation initiation to elongation Nature. 2019; 573 :605-608 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ). A two-step labeling protocol was developed to obtain the Cy3.5-S6-uS19 and uS5-A1-Cy5 (or Cy3-S6-uS19 and biotin-A1-Asc1p) doubly labeled 40S subunits ( Zhou et al., 2007 73. Zhou, Z. ∙ Cironi, P. ∙ Lin, A.J. ... Genetically encoded short peptide tags for orthogonal labelling by Sfp and AcpS phosphopantetheinyl transferases ACS Chem. Biol. 2007; 2 :337-346 Crossref Scopus (188) PubMed Google Scholar ). First, 1 μM of the purified double-tagged 40S subunit was mixed with 2 μM SFP synthase and 10 μM Cy3.5-CoA (or Cy3-CoA) in a reaction buffer containing 50 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl 2 and 1 mM DTT. The reaction was incubated at 30°C for 10 min before the sample was loaded on top of a sucrose cushion (containing 30 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.5, 100 mM KOAc, 5 mM Mg(OAc) 2 , 2 mM DTT and 0.5 M sucrose). The ribosomes were pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 351,955 × g and 4 °C for 60 min in a TLA100.2 rotor, and the resulting Cy3.5-uS19-40S (or Cy3-uS19-40S) was resuspended in storage buffer (50 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.5, 100 mM KOAc, 3 mM Mg(OAc) 2 , 1 mM DTT and 0.25 M sucrose). Next, 1 μM of Cy3.5-uS19-40S (or Cy3-uS19-40S) was mixed with 10 μM AcpS and 30 μM Cy5-CoA (or biotin-CoA) in the same reaction buffer as above, and the reaction mixture was incubated at 30°C for 30 min. The ribosomes were pelleted by ultracentrifugation as described above and the final Cy3.5-Cy5-40S (or Cy3-biotin-40S) were resuspended in the storage buffer and stored at -80°C after liquid nitrogen freezing. Site-specific labeling was verified by SDS-PAGE analysis of the samples from each labeling step.
The native yeast Met-tRNA i was from tRNA Probes, LLC (MI-60), and E. coli Phe-tRNA Phe and Lys-tRNA Lys labeled with Cy3.5, Cy5 or Cy5.5 were prepared and characterized as previously described ( Petrov et al., 2016 47.

Cell. 2016; 62 :92-103 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ). All the mRNAs used in this work were T7 RNA polymerase transcripts with DNA plasmids synthesized by GenScript USA Inc. or gblocks synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. DNA templates were PCR-amplified from plasmids or gblocks, or prepared by restriction enzyme digestion of the plasmids, and used for in vitro transcription with MEGAscript T7 Transcription Kit (Invitrogen, #AM1334). The mRNA transcripts were purified using GeneJET RNA Purification Kit (Thermo Scientific, #K0731), and biotinylated at the 3′end and m 7 G-capped at the 5′ end by Vaccinia capping system (NEB, #M2080S) as previously described ( Wang et al., 2019 69. Wang, J. ∙ Johnson, A.G. ∙ Lapointe, C.P. ... eIF5B gates the transition from translation initiation to elongation Nature. 2019; 573 :605-608 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ). The mRNA sequences were listed in Table S1 .
When labeling the mRNAs by hybridization with a Cy3-DNA oligonucleotide (synthesized by Qiagen or Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc.), 200 nM mRNA and 100 nM DNA oligonucleotide were mixed in 50 mM Bis-Tris Propane pH 7.0 and 100 mM KOAc; the reaction mixture was heated at 65°C for 2 min followed by cooling on ice. For each experiment, the mRNA–DNA hybrid was freshly prepared. To verify that the DNA was annealed to the expected position on the mRNA, the samples were treated with RNase H (NEB, #M0297S,) at 30°C for 30 min and analyzed by 10% TBE-urea PAGE (see Figure S3 F for an example).
For covalent labeling of mRNAs, a three-part splint ligation protocol was applied ( Stark et al., 2006 62. Stark, M.R. ∙ Pleiss, J.A. ∙ Deras, M. ... An RNA ligase-mediated method for the efficient creation of large, synthetic RNAs RNA. 2006; 12 :2014-2019 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ). The covalently labeled mRNAs differed in their 5′ parts (fragment 1) while shared the same two downstream fragments (fragments 2 and 3). The fragments 1-3 sequences for all the different ligated mRNAs were listed in Table S1 . The T7 transcripts of the fragments 1 were m 7 G-capped by Vaccinia capping system, and sequentially treated with RNA 5′ Polyphosphatase (Lucigen #RP8092H) and Terminator 5′-Phosphate-Dependent Exonuclease (Lucigen #TER51020) to deplete uncapped transcripts. The T7 transcript of the fragment 3 was treated with RNA 5′ Polyphosphatase to obtain a mono-phosphate group at its 5′ end for subsequent ligation. The 3′end of the fragment 3 was biotinylated by periodate oxidation and hydrazide conjugation as described ( Wang et al., 2019 69. Wang, J. ∙ Johnson, A.G. ∙ Lapointe, C.P. ... eIF5B gates the transition from translation initiation to elongation Nature. 2019; 573 :605-608 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ). To ligate the three parts of the mRNAs, 6 μM m 7 G-capped fragment 1, 2 μM fragment 2 (which contained a 5′ mono-phosphate group and an internal Cy3 dye), 4 μM biotinylated fragment 3 and 3 μM splint DNA (sequences listed in Table S1 ) were mixed in ddH 2 O. The sample was heated at 65°C for 3 min, followed by 25°C for 5 min and on ice for 5 min. Then the sample was mixed with 1 mM ATP and 1 U/μL T4 RNA ligase (Thermo Scientific, #EL0021) in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl 2 and 10 mM DTT. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37°C for 30 min, then Turbo DNase (Invitrogen #AM2238) was added to final 0.05 U/μL and the reaction was further incubated at 37°C for 15 min to digest the splint DNA. The final mRNA was purified with MEGAclear Transcription Clean-Up Kit (Invitrogen #AM1908).
Ribosome models ( Figures 2 B, S2 K, and S6 A) were analyzed and visualized by ChimeraX ( Pettersen et al., 2021 48. Pettersen, E.F. ∙ Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ... UCSF ChimeraX: structure visualization for researchers, educators, and developers Protein Sci. 2021; 30 :70-82 Crossref Scopus (3735) PubMed Google Scholar ) with PDB 6TNU ( Buschauer et al., 2020 10. Buschauer, R. ∙ Matsuo, Y. ∙ Sugiyama, T. ... The Ccr4-Not complex monitors the translating ribosome for codon optimality Science. 2020; 368 :eaay6912 Crossref Scopus (149) PubMed Google Scholar ) or 3JAQ ( Llácer et al., 2015 38. Llácer, J.L. ∙ Hussain, T. ∙ Marler, L. ... Conformational differences between open and closed states of the eukaryotic translation initiation complex Mol. Cell. 2015; 59 :399-412 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (157) PubMed Google Scholar ).
All single-molecule experiments were performed on a customized ZMW-based RSII instrument from Pacific Bioscience ( Chen et al., 2014 11. Chen, J. ∙ Dalal, R.V. ∙ Petrov, A.N. ... High-throughput platform for real-time monitoring of biological processes by multicolor single-molecule fluorescence Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111 :664-669 Crossref Scopus (101) PubMed Google Scholar ). All the reaction mixtures for the single-molecule initiation assays were prepared as outlined in Figure S1 A, in a buffer containing 30 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 100 mM KOAc and 3 mM Mg(OAc) 2 . A 3× eIF2⋅GTP⋅Met-tRNA i ternary complex mixture was prepared by incubating 2.8 μM eIF2 with 1 mM GTP:Mg 2+ at 30°C for 10 min, then mixed with 2.7 μM Met-tRNA i and incubated for another 5 min at 30°C. Separately, the eEF1A⋅GTP⋅elongator tRNA ternary complexes were prepared by incubating 10 μM eEF1A, 6 μM eEF1Bα with 1 mM GTP:Mg 2+ at room temperature (RT) for 5 min, followed by another 5 min incubation at RT after addition of 1.6 μM elongator tRNA (aminoacylated and with the appropriate dye label), resulting in an elongator TC at 1.6 μM (by tRNA). Next, the 43S PIC mixture was prepared by mixing 0.24 μM 40S (with the appropriate dye label), 3.6 μM eIF1, 3.6 μM eIF1A, 1× eIF2⋅GTP⋅Met-tRNA i ternary complex, 0.6 μM eIF3, 1.8 μM Hcr1p, 1.2 μM eIF5 and 1 mM GTP:Mg 2+ , and incubated at 30°C for 5 min.
For reaction Scheme 1 ( Figure S1 A), a delivery mixture was prepared by diluting the 43S PIC mixture (with Cy3-uS19 labeled 40S) by 3× with the addition of 0.1 μM Cy3.5-Phe-TC, 1.2 μM eIF4A, 1.2 μM eIF4B, 1.2 μM eIF4E, 1.2 μM eIF4G, 1.2 μM Ded1p, 1.2 μM Pab1p, 2 μM eIF5B, 0.2 μM Cy5-60S, 1 mM ATP:Mg 2+ and 1 mM GTP:Mg 2+ , supplemented with 100 μg/mL casein (Sigma Aldrich, #C4032-100MG) as a blocking reagent to prevent non-specific binding of labeled components to the imaging surface, and an oxygen scavenging system (Pacific Bioscience) containing 2.5 mM of protocatechuic acid (PCA), 2.5 mM of TSY, and 2× PCD (protocatechuate-3,4-dioxygenase). Meanwhile, a ZMW chip (Pacific Bioscience) was treated and coated with Neutravidin as previously described ( Wang et al., 2019 69. Wang, J. ∙ Johnson, A.G. ∙ Lapointe, C.P. ... eIF5B gates the transition from translation initiation to elongation Nature. 2019; 573 :605-608 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ). The unlabeled RPL30 mRNA was immobilized on the imaging surface by incubating 30 μL mRNA at 0.2 nM in the ZMW chip at RT for 10 min. The chip was washed twice with an imaging buffer containing ATP:Mg 2+ , GTP:Mg 2+ , casein and the oxygen scavenging system at the same concentrations as in the delivery mix. To start the experiment, 20 μL of fresh imaging buffer was added to the ZMW chip, and the chip was loaded to the RSII instrument. Data acquisition at 10 frames per second and at 30°C (or otherwise noted) was started with a single 532-nm laser excitation at 0.32 μWμm -2 and the delivery of 20 μL delivery mixture to the ZMW chip.
For reaction Scheme 2 ( Figure S1 A), the delivery mixture was the same as above but with eIF4A, eIF4E, eIF4G, Ded1p and Pab1p omitted, while the final imaging buffer was supplemented with eIF4A (at denoted concentrations), 1.2 μM eIF4B, 1.2 μM eIF4E, 1.2 μM eIF4G, 1.2 μM Ded1p and 1.2 μM Pab1p. From addition of the factor-containing imaging buffer to the chip to the beginning of the movie acquisition, the mRNA on the surface was preincubated with the factors for ∼10 min.
For reaction Scheme 3 ( Figure S1 A), the imaging buffer was the same as that for Scheme 2 but without ATP, while the delivery mix contained 2 mM ATP, thus final ATP concentration was 1 mM after delivery mixture was added to the surface.
When titrating ATP concentrations or using slowly hydrolysable ATP analogs, the appropriate concentrations of the analogs were indicated in the main text and figures. Similarly, certain factors were omitted from the reactions or added at different concentrations as denoted in the text and figures to assess their effects on initiation.
For the four-color scanning assay ( Figures 2 A–2C), reaction Scheme 2 was applied (or otherwise noted), but with the elongator TC omitted. The Cy3.5-uS19 and uS5-Cy5 doubly labeled 40S and uL18-Cy5.5-60S were used. The mRNAs were Cy3-labeled as described above. When using mRNAs labeled by Cy3-oligonucleotide hybridization, Ded1p was omitted from the imaging buffer. This was because that the oligonucleotide would be rapidly displaced by Ded1p in the presence of ATP before the movie acquisition and the start of the reaction ( Gao et al., 2016 18. Gao, Z. ∙ Putnam, A.A. ∙ Bowers, H.A. ... Coupling between the DEAD-box RNA helicases Ded1p and eIF4A eLife. 2016; 5 :e16408 Crossref Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ), leading to loss of the mRNA signal. The two-color scanning assay ( Figures 3 A and 3B) was performed in the same way as the four-color scanning assay, except that the uS5-Cy5-40S and unlabeled 60S were used. To determine the mRNA-uS5 FRET efficiencies with varying 40S to mRNA-Cy3 label distances ( Figure S3 A), the two-color scanning assay setup was used, with the RPL30 mRNA labeled by Cy3-DNA oligonucleotides hybridized to the designated positions on the mRNA. To measure upstream CUG initiation efficiency in relation to that of the AUG initiation ( Figures 5 B and S7 B), reaction Scheme 2 was followed. Here, unlabeled mRNAs, unlabeled 40S ( Figure 5 B) or Cy3.5-uS19-40S ( Figure S7 B) and uL18-Cy3-60S were used, and the delivery mixture contained both Cy5.5-Phe-TC and Cy5-Lys-TC.
To probe Cy3.5-eIF4A dynamics, the RPL30 mRNA was labeled with the Cy3-DNA oligonucleotide hybridized to position +20 and immobilized on the imaging surface. The imaging buffer was supplemented with 1.2 μM eIF4A, 1.2 μM eIF4B, 1.2 μM eIF4E, 1.2 μM eIF4G, 1 mM ATP:Mg 2+ , and the oxygen scavenging system. To start the reaction, 20 μL of a delivery mixture was delivered to the ZMW chip. Data were acquired at 10 frames per second and at 30°C with a single 532-nm laser excitation at 0.32 μWμm -2 . The delivery mixture contained either 80 nM Cy3.5-eIF4A ( Figure S2 D), or 80 nM Cy3.5-eIF4A with 43S PICs (prepared as described above with Cy3-40S, and added at the same concentration as above), Cy5-60S along with other required factors ( Figure S2 F).
To probe the interaction between eIF4A and the 40S ( Figure S2 H), the biotin-Asc1p and Cy3-uS19 doubly labeled 40S was tethered on the imaging surface by incubating 2 nM 40S in the ZMW chip at room temperature for 10 min. The chip was washed twice with an imaging buffer containing 1 mM ATP:Mg 2+ , casein and the oxygen scavenging system as described above. To start the experiment, 20 μL of fresh imaging buffer was added to the ZMW chip, and the chip was loaded to the RSII instrument. Data acquisition at 10 frames per second and at 30°C was started with a single 532-nm laser excitation at 0.32 μWμm -2 and the delivery of 20 μL delivery mixture (containing 300 nM Cy5-eIF4A, with or without 1.2 μM eIF4B) to the ZMW chip.
A 652-bp DNA fragment encoding nanoluciferase (NanoLuc) with a C-terminal PEST motif ( NlucP ) was inserted downstream of the yeast PGK1 promoter between the Xma I and Sac II sites and in place of the LacZ coding sequence in the low copy-number URA3 plasmid pC5608 (pJD204.0) ( Harger et al., 2001 24. Harger, J.W. ∙ Meskauskas, A. ∙ Nielsen, J. ...

The sequence of the NlucP DNA fragment is: CCCGGG TGTCTTCACACTCGAAGATTTCGTTGGGGACTGGCGACAGACAGCCGGCTACAACCTGGACCAAGTCCTTGAACAGGGAGGTGTGTCCAGTTTGTTTCAGAATCTCGGGGTGTCCGTAACTCCGATCCAAAGGATTGTCCTGAGCGGTGAAAATGGGCTGAAGATCGACATCCATGTCATCATCCCGTATGAAGGTCTGAGCGGCGACCAAATGGGCCAGATCGAAAAAATTTTTAAGGTGGTGTACCCTGTGGATGATCATCACTTTAAGGTGATCCTGCACTATGGCACACTGGTAATCGACGGGGTTACGCCGAACATGATCGACTATTTCGGACGGCCGTATGAAGGCATCGCCGTGTTCGACGGCAAAAAGATCACTGTAACAGGGACCCTGTGGAACGGCAACAAAATTATCGACGAGCGCCTGATCAACCCCGACGGCTCCCTGCTGTTCCGAGTAACCATCAACGGAGTGACCGGCTGGCGGCTGTGCGAACGCATTCTGGCGAATTCTCACGGCTTTCCGCCTGAGGTTGAAGAGCAAGCCGCCGGTACATTGCCTATGTCCTGCGCACAAGAAAGCGGTATGGACCGGCACCCAGCCGCTTGTGCTTCAGCTCGCATCAACGTCTAATAA CCGCGG
DNA fragments encoding the various 5'UTRs for the reporter plasmids ( Table S2 ) were commercially synthesized (LifeSct LLC and GenScript) and cloned between the Bam HI and Xma I sites in pC6879. Note that all of these inserts contain the coding sequence for the self-cleaving 2A stop-go peptide from ERBV-1 ( Souza-Moreira et al., 2018 61. Souza-Moreira, T.M. ∙ Navarrete, C. ∙ Chen, X. ... Screening of 2A peptides for polycistronic gene expression in yeast FEMS Yeast Res. 2018; 18 :36 Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar ) so that all reporters generate the same NlucP reporter protein.
Yeast transformants were precultured overnight in minimal synthetic dextrose (SD) medium with necessary supplements, then diluted to OD 600nm ∼ 0.2 and incubated at 30°C for ∼2 doubling times in 2 ml SD medium (with necessary supplements). Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and cell pellets were suspended in 1 ml ice-cold 1× PBS (pH 7.4) with 1× Complete protease inhibitor (Roche) and 1 mM AEBSF. Cells were lysed with glass beads by mixing on a vortex for 3 min. Following removal of unbroken cells by centrifugation (3000× g for 5 min), 40 μl of cell lysate was mixed with 10 μl of Nano-Glo Luciferase reagent (100-times diluted with 1× PBS, Promega) and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. Luminescence was measured on a Centro XS3 LB 960 plate reader (Berthold Technologies), and protein concentration in the lysate was measured by NanoDrop Spectrometer (280 nm, NanoDrop Technologies). NlucP activity (luminescence per μg protein) for each reporter was then normalized to the reporter mRNA level.
For mRNA measurements of luciferase reporters, 50-μl aliquots of yeast cell lysates from the NlucP reporter assays were mixed with 100-μl TRI Reagent and then RNA was isolated according to manufacturer’s instructions using the Direct-zol RNA MiniPrep kit (Zymo Research). Single-strand cDNA synthesis was conducted using the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis SuperMix (Invitrogen) per the manufacturer’s instructions. Transcript levels were measured by qPCR with the manufacturer’s protocol for Brilliant III Ultra-Fast SYBR Green QPCR Master Mix (Agilent Technologies) on a Roche LightCycler 960 Instrument. Primers used for measuring transcripts are as follows: Nluc-forward, 5'-ATTGTCCTGAGCGGTGAAA-3'; Nluc-reverse, 5'-CACAGGGTACACCACCTTAAA-3'; ACT1 -forward, 5'-TGTGTAAAGCCGGTTTTGCC-3'; ACT1 -reverse, 5'-GATACCTCTCTTGGATTGAGCTTC-3'. Relative mRNA levels were calculated using the ΔΔCT method (described in https://toptipbio.com/delta-delta-ct-pcr/ ) with ACT1 mRNA levels used for normalization.
The acquired movies were analyzed using custom MATLAB (Mathworks) scripts as described ( Wang et al., 2019 69. Wang, J. ∙ Johnson, A.G. ∙ Lapointe, C.P. ... eIF5B gates the transition from translation initiation to elongation Nature. 2019; 573 :605-608 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, the fluorescence traces from individual ZMWs were manually examined for the presence of the single fluorophores of interests at different time points (e.g. the signal from immobilized, labeled mRNA was expected to be present at the beginning of the movie, whereas signals from fluorophores attached to the 40S, 60S or elongator tRNAs were expected to appear later in the movie). The individual association and dissociation events were manually assigned according to the appearance and disappearance of the corresponding fluorescence signals, to obtain the duration of each molecular event. The mean lifetime (± 95% confidence interval) of each molecular event was estimated by fitting the cumulative probability distribution to a single- or double-exponential equation using cftool in MATLAB. The relationship between the mean scanning time and the 5′UTR length was fit to a linear equation ( Figure 2 E) using Prism version 9.0 (GraphPad Software Inc.). Two-tailed unpaired Student’s t -test was performed using Prism for the scanning times determined under varying ATP conditions with RPL30 and PMA1 mRNAs ( Figure 3 I).
For data from the two-color scanning assay and the two-color eIF4A–40S FRET assay, the Cy3 and Cy5 fluorescence traces were corrected for fluorescence background and bleed-through on a trace-by-trace basis, and the FRET vs. time trajectories were obtained by plotting the time-evolution of the FRET efficiency ( E FRET = I Cy5 /( I Cy5 + I Cy3 ), where I Cy3 and I Cy5 are the intensities of the donor and acceptor dye intensities). The FRET trajectories were idealized with a two-state hidden Markov model implemented with ebFRET followed by manual inspection to correct mis-assigned events (the FRET ramp was treated as the low FRET state) ( van de Meent et al., 2014 64. van de Meent, J.W. ∙ Bronson, J.E. ∙ Wiggins, C.H. ... Empirical Bayes methods enable advanced population-level analyses of single-molecule FRET experiments Biophys. J. 2014; 106 :1327-1337 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (122) PubMed Google Scholar ). Distribution histograms of the E FRET values were plotted in MATLAB and fit to single or double gaussian model to obtain the mean E FRET (± standard deviation) of the FRET states. To estimate the mean lifetime of the FRET ramp in the scanning assay, all the FRET trajectories from each experiment were post-synchronized with the beginning of the FRET set to time 0 and averaged at each movie frame; then the averaged E FRET vs. time trajectory, which mimics the ensemble averaged behavior of all the analyzed molecules, was fit to a single-exponential equation as previously described ( Peng et al., 2017 46. Peng, S. ∙ Sun, R. ∙ Wang, W. ... Single-molecule photoactivation FRET: a general and easy-to-implement approach to break the concentration barrier Angew. Chem. 2017; 129 :6986-6989 Crossref Google Scholar ). To determine the kinetics of the FRET state transitions in experiments with mRNAs carrying 5′UTR structures of different stabilities, the cumulative probability distributions of the state durations were fit to a single- or double-exponential equation, and the estimated mean lifetimes were reported with the 95% confidence intervals.
Statistical details of individual experiments, including number of analyzed molecules (n) and the definition of error bars are indicated in the corresponding figure panels, legends and Data S1 .
Bar graphs for luciferase reporter assays represent the mean and standard deviation derived from three biological replicates. Statistical significance comparisons were made using Student’s two-tailed t tests with a p value threshold < 0.05 using the formula embedded in Prism 9.0 software (GraphPad). Unless noted, all luciferase reporter assays were performed three or more times to confirm reproducibility.
To determine the occupancy of 40S ribosomes on and around structures in proximity to the start codon of endogenous human mRNAs, sequences at positions -55 to -5 relative to the start codon were extracted from Ensembl transcript assembly 94 for 5′UTRs longer than 55 nucleotides. The minimum free energies of these 50-mers were calculated using RNAfold ( Gruber et al., 2008 20. Gruber, A.R. ∙ Lorenz, R. ∙ Bernhart, S.H. ... The Vienna RNA Websuite Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36 :W70-W74 Crossref Scopus (1778) PubMed Google Scholar ). The corresponding transcripts were grouped into two buckets: bucket 1 (referred to as “stable” in Figures S7 D–S7F) with the 50-mers having the potential to form secondary structures more stable than -20 kcal/mol (n = 4890) and bucket 2 (referred to as “weak” in Figure S7 D) with those less stable (n = 28217). Then, the 40S ribosome footprinting data from Bohlen et al. was re-analyzed to determine the frequency of 40S ribosomes on and around this structured/unstructured region using transcriptome alignments as described ( Bohlen et al., 2020 8. Bohlen, J. ∙ Fenzl, K. ∙ Kramer, G. ... Selective 40S footprinting reveals cap-tethered ribosome scanning in human cells Mol. Cell. 2020; 79 :561-574.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ), which were further processed with custom C++ scripts available at Teleman AG Github ( https://github.com/aurelioteleman/Teleman-Lab ). Transcripts with PCR artefacts within this region of the mRNA were excluded from the analysis, leaving 4677 transcripts in bucket 1 and 27765 transcripts in bucket 2. Finally, 40S footprint counts were normalized to the sequencing depth (number of reads aligned to the transcriptome) for each independent library and compared.
