Title: Non-canonical odor coding in the mosquito


Abstract: Summary

Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are a persistent human foe, transmitting arboviruses including dengue when they feed on human blood. Mosquitoes are intensely attracted to body odor and carbon dioxide, which they detect using ionotropic chemosensory receptors encoded by three large multi-gene families. Genetic mutations that disrupt the olfactory system have modest effects on human attraction, suggesting redundancy in odor coding. The canonical view is that olfactory sensory neurons each express a single chemosensory receptor that defines its ligand selectivity. We discovered that Ae. aegypti uses a different organizational principle, with many neurons co-expressing multiple chemosensory receptor genes. In vivo electrophysiology demonstrates that the broad ligand-sensitivity of mosquito olfactory neurons depends on this non-canonical co-expression. The redundancy afforded by an olfactory system in which neurons co-express multiple chemosensory receptors may increase the robustness of the mosquito olfactory system and explain our long-standing inability to disrupt the detection of humans by mosquitoes.

Section: Introduction

Increased global travel, a growing world population, and rising temperatures increase the emergence and transmission of novel disease-causing pathogens spread by mosquitoes, ticks, and fleas. Diseases spread by arthropods collectively account for more than 700,000 deaths every year ( WHO, 2020 121. WHO Fact Sheet: Vector-Borne Diseases World Health Organization, 2020 https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/vector-borne-diseases Google Scholar ). Ae. aegypti mosquitoes spread arboviruses including dengue, Zika, yellow fever, and chikungunya. Female mosquitoes require a blood-meal for reproduction ( Allan et al., 1987 3.

Entomol. 1987; 32 :297-314 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) and prefer to bite humans, which contributes to their effectiveness as a disease vector ( Brown et al., 2014 14.

To identify human hosts, mosquitoes rely heavily on chemosensory cues, including carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emitted from breath, and human body odor, which is a mixture of hundreds of different individual odorants including alcohols such as 1-octen-3-ol and volatile amines such as ammonia ( Acree et al., 1968 2.

Insects detect chemosensory cues using receptors encoded by three large multi-gene families, odorant receptors (ORs), ionotropic receptors (IRs), and gustatory receptors (GRs). All three gene families encode ionotropic ligand-gated ion channels, in contrast to the metabotropic receptors utilized by vertebrates ( Ihara et al., 2013 47. Ihara, S. ∙ Yoshikawa, K. ∙ Touhara, K.

IRs are variant ionotropic glutamate receptors that are formed by one or more of three conserved co-receptors, Ir25a, Ir8a, and Ir76b, and ligand-selective subunits that determine the odorants detected by the receptor complex ( Abuin et al., 2011 1.

Gillies, M.T. The role of carbon dioxide in host-finding by mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae): a review Bull. Entomol. Res. 1980; 70 :525-532 Crossref Google Scholar ) is detected by a heteromultimeric complex of GRs ( Jones et al., 2007 50. Jones, W.D. ∙ Cayirlioglu, P. ∙ Grunwald Kadow, I. ...

Ae. aegypti Gr3 encodes an essential subunit of the CO 2 receptor, and Gr3 mutant mosquitoes lose all sensitivity to CO 2 ( McMeniman et al., 2014 74. McMeniman, C. ∙ Corfas, R. ∙ Matthews, B. ... Multimodal integration of carbon dioxide and other sensory cues drives mosquito attraction to humans Cell. 2014; 156 :1060-1071 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (239) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Because mosquitoes specialize on humans and require blood to reproduce, the drive to find humans is strong and innate. Even mosquitoes missing entire families of chemoreceptors can find and bite people. Orco mutants have no functional ORs yet show strong attraction to humans ( DeGennaro et al., 2013 27.

Deleting Ir8a, Ir76b, or Ir25a co-receptors does not eliminate attraction to humans ( De Obaldia et al., 2022 26. De Obaldia, M.E. ∙ Morita, T. ∙ Dedmon, L.C. ...

Similarly, while mosquitoes lacking Gr3 do not respond to CO 2 , they are highly effective in finding humans in a naturalistic semi-field setting ( McMeniman et al., 2014 74.

The cloning of the first odorant receptors in 1991 ( Buck and Axel, 1991 15. Buck, L. ∙ Axel, R. A novel multigene family may encode odorant receptors: a molecular basis for odor recognition Cell. 1991; 65 :175-187 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) led to the discovery that each vertebrate olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) expresses a single odorant receptor ( Bashkirova and Lomvardas, 2019 4.

Decades of evidence supports the model that neurons expressing a given receptor project axons to dedicated olfactory glomeruli in the first sensory processing center in the brain, the antennal lobe in insects ( Couto et al., 2005 23.

This “one-receptor-to-one-neuron-to-one-glomerulus” organization is believed to be a widespread motif in olfactory systems and is hypothesized to permit the brain to utilize combinatorial coding and parse which subpopulation of olfactory neurons is activated by a given odorant ( Bisch-Knaden et al., 2018 10.

Consistent with this organization, the number of expressed chemosensory receptors in the OR and IR gene families in many insects roughly corresponds to the number of olfactory glomeruli. This holds true in the honeybee Apis mellifera (∼180 receptors/∼160 glomeruli) ( Flanagan and Mercer, 1989 32. Flanagan, D. ∙ Mercer, A.R.

In Ae. aegypti , however, there is a striking mismatch between the number of expressed chemosensory receptors and the number of glomeruli, with at least twice as many receptors as glomeruli ( Bohbot et al., 2007 11.

Zhao, Z. ∙ Zung, J.L. ∙ Hinze, A. ... Mosquito brains encode unique features of human odour to drive host seeking Nature. 2022; 605 :706-712 Crossref Scopus (5) PubMed Google Scholar ). This raises the question of how the mosquito olfactory system is organized and whether a deviation from rules established in other species explains their exquisite ability to locate human hosts.
In this study, we developed a CRISPR-Cas9-based genetic knock-in strategy to generate Ae. aegypti strains that label molecularly distinct populations of OSNs. We discovered that OR- and IR-expressing OSNs frequently innervated the same olfactory glomeruli. To ask if individual olfactory neurons express multiple chemosensory receptors, we profiled endogenous receptor expression in peripheral sensory organs using RNA in situ hybridization, immunofluorescence, and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq). We found that the olfactory system of Ae. aegypti is unconventional in co-expressing multiple chemosensory receptors within individual OSNs. To test if multiple receptors function to detect different ligands within the same OSN, we used in vivo electrophysiology to examine odorant responses and discovered a class of neurons that expresses members of both the OR and IR gene family and found that both ORs and IRs are required to detect different classes of odorants in the same sensory neuron. This sensory organization, in which multiple receptors responding to different chemosensory stimuli are co-expressed, suggests a redundancy in the code for human odor. We speculate that this unconventional organization underlies the robust, seemingly unbreakable properties of the Ae. aegypti olfactory system in detecting human odor in this olfactory specialist.

Section: Results

In the mosquito, olfactory cues are sensed by OSNs in the antenna and the maxillary palp, whose axons project to the ipsilateral antennal lobe ( Distler and Boeckh, 1997 29. Distler, P. ∙ Boeckh, J.

Mosquito brains encode unique features of human odour to drive host seeking Nature. 2022; 605 :706-712 Crossref Scopus (5) PubMed Google Scholar ) discrete olfactory glomeruli in the female Ae. aegypti antennal lobe. In this study, we define approximately 65 olfactory glomeruli (64.9 ± 0.9, mean ± SEM). This number was obtained by counting glomeruli in the left hemisphere of 12 female Ae. aegypti brains stained to reveal synaptic neuropil ( Figures 1 B, 1I–1K, S1 , S2 , and S3 ). The glomerulus count ranged from 60 to 72 glomeruli, indicating a high level of variability in antennal lobe organization.
Canonical olfactory organization posits that the number of chemosensory receptors should roughly match the number of glomeruli in the antennal lobe ( Figure 1 D). In Ae. Aegypti , there are 324 structural genes for chemosensory receptors (117 OR, 135 IR, and 72 GR genes) ( Figure 1 E) ( Matthews et al., 2018 66. Matthews, B.J. ∙ Dudchenko, O. ∙ Kingan, S.B. ... Improved reference genome of Aedes aegypti informs arbovirus vector control Nature. 2018; 563 :501-507 Crossref Scopus (218) PubMed Google Scholar ). Analysis of antennal and maxillary palp RNA-seq data ( Matthews et al., 2016 67. Matthews, B.J. ∙ McBride, C.S. ∙ DeGennaro, M. ... The neurotranscriptome of the Aedes aegypti mosquito BMC Genom. 2016; 17 :32 Crossref Scopus (110) PubMed Google Scholar ) demonstrates that even at the conservative threshold of 5 transcripts per million (TPM), the mosquito olfactory system expresses 102 chemosensory receptors. Adjusting the threshold to 2, 1, or 0.5 TPM increases the number of receptors plausibly expressed to 134, 156, and 178, respectively ( Figures 1 F and 1G). Thus, there are many more chemosensory receptors expressed than antennal lobe glomeruli. This mismatch could be resolved by expressing multiple receptors per neuron or having multiple molecularly distinct neurons co-converge on a single glomerulus or a combination of co-expression and co-convergence ( Figure 1 H).
To distinguish between these possibilities, we generated CRISPR-Cas9 gene-targeted strains that label subpopulations of olfactory neurons. We used the Q-system, a binary expression system that uses cell-type-specific expression of the QF2 transcription factor, to induce expression of an effector when QF2 binds a QUAS enhancer ( Potter et al., 2010 80.

We introduced an in-frame insertion that replaced the stop codon of each of the co-receptors Orco , Ir25a , Ir8a , and Ir76b , as well as Gr3 with the transcription factor QF2 ( Figures 1 I, S1 , S2 , and S3 ; see Data S1 for a full description of all genotypes by figure) ( Matthews et al., 2019 68.

We crossed these QF2 driver lines individually to a QUAS-CD8:GFP reporter to label neuronal membranes and visualized axonal projection patterns in the antennal lobe.
Orco , Ir25a , Ir8a , and Ir76b co-receptor driver lines exhibited reporter expression in OSNs with distinct projection patterns in the antennal lobe ( Figures 1 I–1K). Unexpectedly, neurons that expressed Ir25a projected to almost all glomeruli in the antennal lobe (89.9 ± 1.4%, mean ± SEM, n = 3) ( Figures 1 I–1K and S2 ), and expression overlapped extensively with glomeruli labeled by Orco ( Figures 1 I–1K, S1 , and S2 ). Interindividual expression patterns were not identical, consistent with the variability in glomerular arrangement that we observed. Neurons that detect CO 2 are located in the maxillary palp ( Grant et al., 1995 40. Grant, A.J. ∙ Wigton, B.E. ∙ Aghajanian, J.G. ...

Loss of response to carbon dioxide in palpectomized female mosquitoes Ent Exp & Appl. 1971; 14 :251-252 Crossref Google Scholar ). Gr3 -expressing neurons projected to a large glomerulus in the posterior antennal lobe, Glomerulus 1 ( Figures 1 I–1K), which is also innervated by Ir25a -expressing neurons. We noted the presence of a second small glomerulus that was often innervated by Gr3 -expressing neurons in the antenna ( Figures S1 O and S1P). These initial findings point to the overlap of projections of OR- , IR- , and GR -expressing neurons in the antennal lobe of Ae. aegypti , consistent with recent observations in D. melanogaster ( Task et al., 2022 109. Task, D. ∙ Lin, C.C. ∙ Vulpe, A. ... Chemoreceptor co-expression in Drosophila melanogaster olfactory neurons Elife. 2022; 11 :e72599 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The high degree of overlap between glomeruli labeled by Orco - and Ir25a -expressing OSNs suggests that there is either widespread Orco and Ir25a co-expression within individual neurons or that Orco and Ir25a are expressed in different neurons whose axons co-converge onto individual antennal lobe glomeruli or both ( Figure 1 H). To determine if Orco and Ir25a are co-expressed, we used the Split-QF2 system ( Riabinina et al., 2019 88. Riabinina, O. ∙ Vernon, S.W. ∙ Dickson, B.J. ... Split-QF system for fine-tuned transgene expression in Drosophila Genetics. 2019; 212 :53-63 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ), which “splits” the transcription factor QF2 into two components, the DNA binding domain (QF2-DBD) and the activation domain (QF2-AD) each tagged with a synthetic leucine zipper ( Figures 2 A and 2B). When both the QF2-DBD and QF2-AD are co-expressed in the same cell, the two domains associate via the leucine zipper, reconstitute a functional QF2 protein, initiate transcription at the QUAS enhancer, and drive expression of a reporter gene ( Figure 2 C).
When either Ir25a-QF2-AD or Orco-QF2-DBD was used to drive expression of dTomato ( Shaner et al., 2004 99. Shaner, N.C. ∙ Campbell, R.E. ∙ Steinbach, P.A. ... Improved monomeric red, orange and yellow fluorescent proteins derived from Discosoma sp. red fluorescent protein Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22 :1567-1572 Crossref Scopus (3440) PubMed Google Scholar ), we did not see fluorescence in the female antenna, maxillary palp, or the antennal lobe ( Figures 2 D–2F and S4 ), but when Orco-QF2-DBD and IR25a-QF2-AD were crossed into the same animal, we saw expression of dTomato in antennal and maxillary palp neurons of female mosquitoes, as well as axonal projections in the antennal lobe ( Figures 2 D–2F and S4 ). Nearly half of the glomeruli in the antennal lobe were labeled with dTomato ( Figures 2 G–2I and S4 ). This points to widespread Orco and Ir25a co-expression, although these findings do not rule out the possibility that there may also be co-convergence. Male mosquitoes ( Figures 2 J–2U) showed similar expression and projection patterns to those found in females ( Figures 2 F, 2G, and 2U).
Another source of olfactory information may derive from olfactory neurons on the proboscis, the mouthpart of the mosquito. We saw extensive expression of both Orco and Ir25a alone in the proboscis and the subesophageal zone ( Figure S4 ) as well as co-expression of Orco and Ir25a as defined by dTomato expression in the Split-QF2 animals ( Figure S4 ). It is possible that sensory afferents in the proboscis detect olfactory and gustatory information, or that IRs and ORs both function as olfactory receptors in these neurons.
To determine if neurons co-express Orco and Ir25a protein, we conducted whole mount antennal immunofluorescence to label endogenous Orco and Ir25a proteins in wild-type mosquito antennae and observed extensive co-expression of Orco and Ir25a ( Figures 3 A–3D). In addition to neurons that contain both Orco and Ir25a protein, we saw neurons that express either Orco or Ir25a alone ( Figures 3 A–3D), indicating a mixed population of OR cells, IR cells, and OR + IR cells. Staining was absent in the respective Orco and Ir25a mutants, confirming the specificity of the antibodies ( Figures 3 E–3H). To confirm and extend these results, we performed RNA in situ hybridization on wild-type antennae with Orco, Ir76b, and Ir25a probes ( Figures 3 I–3K) and discovered that almost half of Orco cells co-express Ir25a , and vice versa. In contrast, few Orco cells co-express Ir76b .
To study the overlap between Orco and the three major IR co-receptors, we carried out antennal immunofluorescence with antibodies to the endogenous Orco protein and to GFP expressed from each QF2 driver. We confirmed extensive co-expression of Orco and Ir25a ( Figures 3 L–3N) and found that substantially fewer cells co-express either Orco and Ir8a or Orco and Ir76b , even after accounting for fewer total Ir76b and Ir8a cells ( Figures 3 L–3N). In addition to widespread co-receptor co-expression, some olfactory neurons express just one co-receptor ( Figure 3 O), highlighting the complexity in receptor expression patterns in Ae. aegypti antennal neurons.
Functional ORs and IRs are composed of co-receptor and ligand-selective receptor subunits. Because there are hundreds of ligand-selective OR and IR genes, it was not feasible to examine combinatorial co-expression of the full complement of receptors by fluorescent RNA in situ hybridization or immunofluorescence. Instead, we carried out snRNA-seq ( Li et al., 2022 60. Li, H. ∙ Janssens, J. ∙ De Waegeneer, M. ... Fly Cell Atlas: a single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the adult fruit fly Science. 2022; 375 :eabk2432 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ; McLaughlin et al., 2021 73. McLaughlin, C.N. ∙ Brbić, M. ∙ Xie, Q. ... Single-cell transcriptomes of developing and adult olfactory receptor neurons in Drosophila Elife. 2021; 10 :e63856 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) in mosquito antennae and identified 13,879 total cells (we use the term “cell” to refer to data from a single nucleus) ( Figures 4 A and S5 A–S5G). Unsupervised clustering was used to categorize cells into broad subtypes, which revealed clusters expressing epithelial or glial markers ( Figures 4 B, S5 G, and S5H). We classified neuron clusters based on the expression of at least 3 of 4 neural markers ( cadN , brp , syt1 , elav ) in 50% or more of the cells within that cluster, resulting in a total of 5,175 identified neurons ( Figure S5 I).
We used unsupervised clustering with high resolution on the neuron population to identify chemosensory cell types, here defined as a group of cells expressing the same chemosensory receptor gene or combination of receptor genes ( Figure 4 C). We classified clusters 2 and 25 as mechanosensory neurons (6.78% of total neurons) based on expression of LOC5575210 , a homolog of the D. melanogaster mechanoreceptor nompC . Over 90% of all identified neurons clustered according to distinct patterns of ligand-selective receptor gene expression, comprising at least 35 detectable chemosensory cell types ( Figures 4 D and S6 A).
By averaging receptor gene expression across a cluster, we identified many clusters in which multiple receptors—multiple ORs, multiple IRs, as well as ORs and IRs together—were co-expressed ( Figures 4 D and S6 A). Often individual chemosensory receptors belonged to only one cluster, either expressed alone or within a set of chemosensory receptors. Some receptors appeared in multiple clusters with different sets of co-expression partners, such as Or82 ( Figure 4 F). Some clusters contained OSNs that clustered together yet express distinct chemoreceptors, likely due to global transcriptome similarity ( Figures 4 D and S5 L–S5M). This is observed in cluster 0, which expresses Ir41k , Ir41o , and Ir41p , but these genes do not appear to be co-expressed within individual cells ( Figure S5 M). Thus, we performed cluster-independent analyses to document mutually exclusive expression and co-expression of chemoreceptors.
We defined co-expression of two receptor genes when expression of both occurred in more than 10 cells above a normalized value of 1 (equivalent to an adjusted-unique molecular identifier [UMI] threshold of 2 or higher) ( Figures 4 E, S6 A, and S6B). For Orco, which is expressed at an order of magnitude higher than other receptor genes and contributes more to ambient RNA contamination, we used a normalized expression threshold of 2 ( Figures S5 A, S5F, and S6). Within cells in cluster 38, we observed above-threshold co-expression of Orco, Ir25a and ligand-specific receptors Or82 , Ir41l , and other ligand-specific ORs and IRs ( Figures 4 D and 4F). Co-expression of Orco and Ir25a appeared in individual cells in over 10% of our neuron population ( Figure S5 K). For example, in ligand-specific OR-expressing clusters 9 and 5, many cells also express Ir25a ( Figure S6 ).
The significance of variable expression levels among receptor genes in their respective cells remains unclear. Ir41k is expressed at very high levels, even in relation to co-receptors ( Figure S5 M and S6 A). Using our expression criteria, Ir41k is expressed in 59 cells but has a greater number of total counts than Ir8a , which is expressed in over four times as many cells ( Figure S5 F and S6 A). These results highlight the diversity of chemoreceptor expression levels in antennal neurons. Future studies may reveal how variability in expression levels may interact with activity.
We next examined receptor co-expression in the maxillary palp, a smaller and simpler olfactory organ that detects important host cues including CO 2 and 1-octen-3-ol ( Grant et al., 1995 40.

Omer, S.M. ∙ Gillies, M.T. Loss of response to carbon dioxide in palpectomized female mosquitoes Ent Exp & Appl. 1971; 14 :251-252 Crossref Google Scholar ). Each female Ae. aegypti maxillary palp contains approximately 35 capitate-peg sensilla that each house three chemosensory neurons ( McIver, 1982 72. McIver, S.B. Sensilla mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae). J. Med. Entomol. 1982; 19 :489-535 Crossref Scopus (165) PubMed Google Scholar ) termed “A,” “B,” and “C” cells based on their size, from largest to smallest respectively ( Figures 5 A–5C and S3 V).
We hypothesized that these three cell types project to three glomeruli in the antennal lobe, and we used our QF2 and Split-QF2 driver lines to examine this ( Figures 5 E–5K). We discovered that Glomerulus 1, which is the largest glomerulus in the antennal lobe ( Shankar and McMeniman, 2020 100. Shankar, S. ∙ McMeniman, C.J. An updated antennal lobe atlas for the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2020; 14 :e0008729 Crossref Scopus (4) PubMed Google Scholar ), received input from Gr3- and Ir25a -expressing sensory afferents ( Figures 5 F–5K). Glomerulus 2 and Glomerulus 3 received input from Orco -, Ir25a- , and Ir76b -expressing neurons ( Figures 5 F–5K). Co-expression of Orco and Ir25a in neurons that project to these two glomeruli was confirmed using the Split-QF2 system. In Orco-QF2-DBD , IR25a-QF2-AD animals, Glomerulus 2 and Glomerulus 3 were labeled, but Glomerulus 1 was not ( Figure 5 E). These findings suggest that the A, B, and C cells express multiple co-receptors, spanning IR-OR and IR-GR classes.
To determine the extent of co-expression of both co-receptors and ligand-selective receptors, we carried out multiplexed whole-mount RNA in situ hybridization ( Choi et al., 2018 18. Choi, H.M.T. ∙ Schwarzkopf, M. ∙ Fornace, M.E. ... Third-generation in situ hybridization chain reaction: multiplexed, quantitative, sensitive, versatile, robust Development. 2018; 145 :dev165753 Crossref Scopus (284) PubMed Google Scholar ) in the maxillary palp ( Figures 5 L–5P and S3 ), which expresses only 18 receptors at the 1 TPM threshold compared to 138 in the antenna ( Figures 1 F and 1G). We performed RNA in situ hybridization with probes for 10 of these receptors and visualized gene expression with sufficient sensitivity that even Or71 and Ir75g (present at 1.93 and 1.67 TPM, respectively) were readily detected ( Figures S3 S and S3T).
We found no overlap in expression of Orco and Gr3 , but Ir25a was expressed in all Orco and all Gr3 cells ( Figure 5 L). Previous work in Anopheles gambiae suggested that Orco -expressing neurons in the maxillary palp can be evenly divided into two non-overlapping groups: an Or8 population and an Or49 population ( Lu et al., 2007 62. Lu, T. ∙ Qiu, Y.T. ∙ Wang, G. ... Odor coding in the maxillary palp of the malaria vector mosquito Anopheles gambiae Curr. Biol. 2007; 17 :1533-1544 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (239) PubMed Google Scholar ). The same was assumed in Ae. aegypti but has never been shown. We show definitively that Or8 and Or49 are expressed in segregated populations of Orco -expressing neurons ( Figure 5 M) and, when combined with the results of the previous experiment ( Figure 5 L), that these cells are all Ir25a -positive. Additional RNA in situ hybridization experiments revealed that Or8 - and Or49- expressing cells also often express Ir76b, with a bias toward expression in Or8 -expressing B cells ( Figures 5 N and S3 ; Data S1 ). Therefore, Orco -expressing OSNs co-express the co-receptor Ir25a and either of the ligand-selective subunits Or49 or Or8 , and often co-express the co-receptor Ir76b.
When we analyzed IR ligand-selective subunit expression, we found that Ir100a and Ir93a are selectively expressed in a subset of Or49 -expressing C cells ( Figures 5 O, 5P, S3 P, and S3Q), suggesting that both functional OR and IR complexes can form in the same neuron and that co-expression may be transcriptionally coordinated. Or71 and Or49 were co-expressed, further supporting the idea that multiple ligand-selective ORs can be expressed in an OSN ( Figure S3 S). We also discovered that the ligand-selective receptor Ir75g was expressed in some Gr3 -expressing cells, which also express Ir25a ( Figure S3 T). It is plausible that Gr3 neurons can express both functional GRs and IRs.
Our RNA in situ hybridization results contradict the current view in the field: that each Ae. aegypti maxillary palp has 35 molecularly and functionally identical capitate-peg sensilla ( Figure 5 A). To expand our analysis, we carried out snRNA-seq using similar methods to those described for the antenna ( Figures 6 A and S7 ), which yielded data from 2,298 cells. Using unsupervised clustering, we identified some clusters as epithelia, muscle, glia, or neurons ( Figure 6 B, 6C, and S7 E–S7G). The neuron clusters contained 630 cells that were subdivided into four classes with remarkable correspondence to cell classes previously described in the maxillary palp ( Figures 6 C, 6D, S7 F, S7G, S7L, and S7O). Cluster 4 consists of putative mechanosensory neurons marked by expression of nompC and hamlet . Clusters 1, 2, and 3 were enriched for Gr3 , Or8 , or Or49 , and likely correspond to A, B, and C cells, respectively ( Figures 6 D, 6F, 6J, 6K, S7 L, and S7O). Applying similar parameters for receptor co-expression as for the antenna, we found that Or49 sometimes co-expressed with Ir93a ( Figure 6 E), in accordance with our RNA in situ hybridization results.
Because the maxillary palp data had both fewer neurons and chemoreceptors, as well as sparser expression than in the antenna, we framed our analysis on the three known cell classes. We established expression within a cell class such that a receptor was present in at least 10 cells within the corresponding cluster above a normalized expression value of 1 ( Figure 6 Q). We used feature plots to visualize the expression of ligand-specific receptors within the clusters of maxillary palp neurons. snRNA-seq data showed expression of Ir41a and Ir161 in both the Or8- expressing B and Or49 -expressing C clusters ( Figures 6 J, 6K, 6O, and 6P), as well as the Or49- expressing C cluster sometimes expressed Ir100a ( Figure 6 M). As we saw in the RNA in situ hybridization findings, cells expressing Or49 , Or8 , or Gr3 can but do not always express certain ligand-specific IRs, indicating that these classes are likely to be heterogeneous.
Ir25a appeared in a high percentage of cells in all three clusters, accompanied by Ir76b in only the B and C cell clusters ( Figures 6 H, 6I, S7 L, and S7O). Abundant chemoreceptors such as Gr2 , Orco , and Or8 were expressed highly in their expected cell classes ( Figures 6 G, 6J, and S7 K–S7O). Lower-level expression of these genes was also present in a high percentage of cells from other clusters. The significance of this is unclear.
A summary and interpretation of maxillary palp chemosensory receptor gene expression is presented in Figure 6 Q. These data suggest that many B and C cells have all the necessary subunits to form both functional ORs and IRs ( Figures 6 F–6P), representing a departure from the current view.
We next asked whether chemosensory receptor co-expression allows maxillary palp neurons to respond to odorants detected by both ORs and IRs. We used single sensillum recording to measure odorant responses of the OSNs housed in maxillary palp capitate-peg sensilla. This method of in vivo extracellular electrophysiology enables the simultaneous recordings of A, B, and C cells in response to odorant stimuli in an intact mosquito. Spike sorting is used to discriminate activity of these neurons. The diameter of the cell positively correlates with the spike amplitude ( Zhang et al., 2019 125. Zhang, Y. ∙ Tsang, T.K. ∙ Bushong, E.A. ... Asymmetric ephaptic inhibition between compartmentalized olfactory receptor neurons Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :1560 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ). The largest A cell responds to CO 2 , whereas the smaller B cell responds to 1-octen-3-ol ( Bohbot and Dickens, 2009 12.

Maxillary palps are broad spectrum odorant detectors in Culex quinquefasciatus Chem. Senses. 2007; 32 :727-738 Crossref Scopus (80) PubMed Google Scholar ). The smallest C cell has no characteristic ligands in Ae. aegypti and was therefore excluded from our analysis ( Figures 7 A–7E).
To determine which family of receptors—GRs, ORs, or IRs—detects a given ligand, we recorded odorant responses in wild-type mosquitoes as well as mosquitoes with mutations in Gr3 , Orco , or Ir25a . Because the Gr3 and Orco receptor mutants were generated in a different wild-type strain ( +/+ ORL ) than the Ir25a mutant ( +/+ LVP ) ( De Obaldia et al., 2022 26. De Obaldia, M.E. ∙ Morita, T. ∙ Dedmon, L.C. ... Differential mosquito attraction to humans is associated with skin-derived carboxylic acid levels Preprint at bioRxiv. 2022; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ), all analyses were conducted in two different wild-type background strains, which consistently showed similar odorant responses ( Figures 7 A–7E).
As previously seen ( McMeniman et al., 2014 74. McMeniman, C. ∙ Corfas, R. ∙ Matthews, B. ... Multimodal integration of carbon dioxide and other sensory cues drives mosquito attraction to humans Cell. 2014; 156 :1060-1071 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (239) PubMed Google Scholar ), the A cell responded to CO 2 in a dose-dependent manner, but the B cell did not. The A cell CO 2 response was abolished in Gr3 mutants ( Figure 7 A). CO 2 -sensing neurons in the mosquito maxillary palp respond to multiple odorants ( Lu et al., 2007 62.

Ultra-prolonged activation of CO 2 -sensing neurons disorients mosquitoes Nature. 2011; 474 :87-91 Crossref Scopus (120) PubMed Google Scholar ), and it has been proposed that Gr3 is a broadly tuned receptor that responds to many odorants. We examined the response to a recently identified A cell agonist, acetone ( Ghaninia et al., 2019 36. Ghaninia, M. ∙ Majeed, S. ∙ Dekker, T. ... Hold your breath - Differential behavioral and sensory acuity of mosquitoes to acetone and carbon dioxide PLoS One. 2019; 14 :e0226815 Crossref Scopus (5) PubMed Google Scholar ), which also activated the A cell but not the B cell ( Figure 7 B). The response to acetone was abolished in the Gr3 mutant ( Figure 7 B), which suggests that the CO 2 receptor interacts with non-CO 2 ligands.
The host-emitted odorant 1-octen-3-ol has been shown to activate the B cell, as well as Ae. aegypti and An. gambiae Or8-Orco when expressed in heterologous cells ( Bohbot and Dickens, 2009 12.

Biol. 2007; 17 :1533-1544 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (239) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that firing of the B cell, but not the A cell, increased in the presence of 1-octen-3-ol, and this response was abolished in the Orco mutant, but not in Gr3 or Ir25a mutants ( Figure 7 C), consistent with the role of Or8-Orco in detecting this compound.
Volatile amines, including polyamines, have been proposed to be IR ligands in D. melanogaster ( Geier et al., 1999 35. Geier, M. ∙ Bosch, O.J. ∙ Boeckh, J.

Complementary function and integrated wiring of the evolutionarily distinct Drosophila olfactory subsystems J. Neurosci. 2011; 31 :13357-13375 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). We therefore examined the response of maxillary palp neurons to two volatile amines, hexyl amine, and triethyl amine. We found that both amines activated the B cell in wild type, Gr3 mutants, and Orco mutants ( Figures 7 D–7F). Average responses to hexyl amine and triethyl amine were strongly reduced but not abolished in the Ir25a mutant. When we scrutinized the raw data, we noted that the majority of Ir25a mutant neurons did not respond to these stimuli at all, but a few neurons responded to both stimuli even more robustly than wild type ( Data S1 ).
To determine if there are two different functional types of B neurons, we generated an independent dataset using these stimuli to examine responses in an additional 17 wild-type ( +/+ LVP ) neurons and 23 Ir25a mutant neurons. The response to the water control stimulus never exceeded 30 spikes/s firing frequency in either genotype, and we used this as a threshold to classify neurons as “responders” or “non-responders” ( Figures 7 G–7I). We found that all +/+ LVP neurons responded to triethyl amine, and 16 out of 17 +/+ LVP neurons responded to hexyl amine ( Figures 7 H and 7I). Responses to both amines were significantly higher than the water control in +/+ LVP . In contrast, most neurons in the Ir25a mutant did not respond to either triethyl amine or hexyl amine (78.3%, n = 23), and neither stimulus elicited significantly different responses from the water control when taking the entire population of 23 neurons into account.
We noted that 5 out of 23 neurons (21.7%) showed strong responses to both amines that exceeded the corresponding response in +/+ LVP neurons ( Figures 7 G–7I). These neurons were considered outliers by a ROUT (robust regression followed by outlier identification) analysis (Q = 1%), consistent with the classification system that we used to categorize neurons as responders or non-responders. Given our discovery of multiple additional IRs and ORs co-expressed along with Or8 in the B cells ( Figure 6 Q), we speculate that there are at least two distinct types of B neurons, one that requires Ir25a to respond to amines and one that does not. We hypothesize that this second type of B neuron expresses the Ir76b co-receptor. Our findings that the B cell responds to 1-octen-3-ol in an Orco -dependent manner and to triethyl amine and hexyl amine in an Ir25a -dependent manner is consistent with the hypothesis that ORs and IRs are functionally co-expressed in the same neurons.

Section: Discussion

The mismatch between the number of receptors in the Ae. aegypti genome and the number of glomeruli in the antennal lobe is resolved in part by co-expression of multiple chemoreceptors in individual OSNs. We found that co-expression is widespread, both between and within OR and IR families, and that the number of receptors expressed in a neuron can vary substantially. While some neurons express only an individual co-receptor and ligand-selective receptor pair, others express “sets” of frequently co-expressed receptor subunits, and in a few cases a single receptor subunit could be co-expressed with completely different combinations of receptor subunits.
Many commonly co-expressed IRs and ORs belong to mosquito gene family expansions. The Ir41 clade was among the most common of the detected ligand-specific IRs, and Ir41l was found to be co-expressed with ORs, which may be indicative of more multi-family co-expression below detection thresholds of the snRNA-seq. This clade is expanded in Ae. aegypti relative to D. melanogaster ( Matthews et al., 2018 66. Matthews, B.J. ∙ Dudchenko, O. ∙ Kingan, S.B. ... Improved reference genome of Aedes aegypti informs arbovirus vector control Nature. 2018; 563 :501-507 Crossref Scopus (218) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the D. melanogaster orthologues, Ir41a , Ir76a , and Ir92a , compose channels that respond to amines ( Hussain et al., 2016 45.

Volatile amines are enriched in human odor and play an important role in the detection of humans by mosquitoes ( Bernier et al., 2000 9. Bernier, U.R. ∙ Kline, D.L. ∙ Barnard, D.R. ...

De Obaldia, M.E. ∙ Morita, T. ∙ Dedmon, L.C. ... Differential mosquito attraction to humans is associated with skin-derived carboxylic acid levels Preprint at bioRxiv. 2022; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). It is possible that the Ir41 clade expansion in Ae. aegypti enhances their ability to detect amines in human odor. Many of the commonly co-expressed ORs are also members of gene expansions in Ae. aegypti and An. gambiae but have no direct orthologues in D. melanogaster ( Matthews et al., 2018 66. Matthews, B.J. ∙ Dudchenko, O. ∙ Kingan, S.B. ... Improved reference genome of Aedes aegypti informs arbovirus vector control Nature. 2018; 563 :501-507 Crossref Scopus (218) PubMed Google Scholar ). These may have ligands that are enriched in human odor.
Co-receptors and ligand-selective receptor co-expression poses a gene regulatory problem for an olfactory neuron. We have demonstrated that multiple ORs and IRs are expressed in specific receptor “sets.” How might this complex receptor co-expression code be regulated? In vertebrates, an epigenetic silencing mechanism ensures that each olfactory neuron stochastically expresses only a single allele of one odorant receptor ( Bashkirova and Lomvardas, 2019 4. Bashkirova, E. ∙ Lomvardas, S. Olfactory receptor genes make the case for inter-chromosomal interactions Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2019; 55 :106-113 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast, D. melanogaster uses a conventional transcription factor code in which the specification of a neuron and its chemoreceptor is tightly regulated ( Jafari and Alenius, 2015 49. Jafari, S. ∙ Alenius, M. Cis-regulatory mechanisms for robust olfactory sensory neuron class-restricted odorant receptor gene expression in Drosophila PLoS Genet. 2015; 11 :e1005051 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ; Li et al., 2016 61. Li, Q. ∙ Barish, S. ∙ Okuwa, S. ... A functionally conserved gene regulatory network module governing olfactory neuron diversity PLoS Genet. 2016; 12 :e1005780 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ray et al., 2008 83. Ray, A. ∙ van Naters, W.v. d.G. ∙ Carlson, J.R. A regulatory code for neuron-specific odor receptor expression PLoS Biol. 2008; 6 :e125 Crossref Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Other examples exist of receptor co-expression within a single chemosensory gene family. Polycistronic expression of multiple ORs in An. gambiae sensory neurons has been reported ( Karner et al., 2015 52. Karner, T. ∙ Kellner, I. ∙ Schultze, A. ... Co-expression of six tightly clustered odorant receptor genes in the antenna of the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae Front Ecol Evol. 2015; 3 Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar ). This differs from Ae. aegypti , where co-expressed ORs are not necessarily neighboring genes. In D. melanogaster there are rare cases of OR-OR or OR-IR co-expression. These are thought to be the exceptions rather than the rule. Or49a and Or85f are co-expressed in an OSN population where they play redundant roles in predator avoidance ( Ebrahim et al., 2015 30. Ebrahim, S.A.M. ∙ Dweck, H.K.M. ∙ Stokl, J. ... Drosophila avoids parasitoids by sensing their semiochemicals via a dedicated olfactory circuit PLoS Biol. 2015; 13 :e1002318 Crossref Scopus (81) PubMed Google Scholar ). Or35a is co-expressed with Ir76b ( Silbering et al., 2011 101. Silbering, A.F. ∙ Rytz, R. ∙ Grosjean, Y. ... Complementary function and integrated wiring of the evolutionarily distinct Drosophila olfactory subsystems J. Neurosci. 2011; 31 :13357-13375 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), and while these neurons respond to many odorants ( Silbering et al., 2011 101. Silbering, A.F. ∙ Rytz, R. ∙ Grosjean, Y. ... Complementary function and integrated wiring of the evolutionarily distinct Drosophila olfactory subsystems J. Neurosci. 2011; 31 :13357-13375 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yao et al., 2005 124. Yao, C.A. ∙ Ignell, R. ∙ Carlson, J.R. Chemosensory coding by neurons in the coeloconic sensilla of the Drosophila antenna J. Neurosci. 2005; 25 :8359-8367 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), the role of co-expression remains unknown. Recent work suggests that there may be more examples to be discovered in flies ( McLaughlin et al., 2021 73. McLaughlin, C.N. ∙ Brbić, M. ∙ Xie, Q. ... Single-cell transcriptomes of developing and adult olfactory receptor neurons in Drosophila Elife. 2021; 10 :e63856 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Task et al., 2022 109. Task, D. ∙ Lin, C.C. ∙ Vulpe, A. ... Chemoreceptor co-expression in Drosophila melanogaster olfactory neurons Elife. 2022; 11 :e72599 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Our findings are reminiscent of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans , which co-expresses a large number of chemosensory receptor genes in a small number of sensory neurons ( Troemel et al., 1995 111. Troemel, E.R. ∙ Chou, J.H. ∙ Dwyer, N.D. ... Divergent seven transmembrane receptors are candidate chemosensory receptors in C. elegans Cell. 1995; 83 :207-218 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (536) PubMed Google Scholar ; Vidal et al., 2018 114. Vidal, B. ∙ Aghayeva, U. ∙ Sun, H. ... An atlas of Caenorhabditis elegans chemoreceptor expression PLoS Biol. 2018; 16 :e2004218 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ). Ae. aegypti have many more chemosensory neurons than C. elegans and the circuit organization differs dramatically. Extensive olfactory receptor co-expression is also seen in a subpopulation of OSNs in mice that each express multiple MS4a chemosensory receptors and project to the so-called necklace glomeruli that surround the main olfactory bulb ( Greer et al., 2016 41. Greer, P.L. ∙ Bear, D.M. ∙ Lassance, J.M. ... A family of non-GPCR chemosensors defines an alternative logic for mammalian olfaction Cell. 2016; 165 :1734-1748 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (68) PubMed Google Scholar ). Interestingly these neurons respond to cues that regulate innate behaviors.
The maxillary palp is a multi-modal sensory organ that responds to CO 2 ( Acree et al., 1968 2. Acree, Jr., F. ∙ Turner, R.B. ∙ Gouck, H.K. ...

Tauxe, G. ∙ MacWilliam, D. ∙ Boyle, S. ... Targeting a dual detector of skin and CO 2 to modify mosquito host seeking Cell. 2013; 155 :1365-1379 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ). The prior view of the organization of the maxillary palp is that all volatile odorant-detecting capitate-peg sensilla house the sensory dendrites of three neurons that form identical repeating units ( Lu et al., 2007 62. Lu, T. ∙ Qiu, Y.T. ∙ Wang, G. ... Odor coding in the maxillary palp of the malaria vector mosquito Anopheles gambiae Curr. Biol. 2007; 17 :1533-1544 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (239) PubMed Google Scholar ; McIver, 1972 71. McIver, S.B. Fine structure of pegs on the palps of female culicine mosquitoes Can. J. Zool. 1972; 50 :571-576 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is difficult to reconcile the functional diversity of responses with this simple cellular organization. We demonstrate that the receptor composition of these neurons is far more varied. They can be subdivided into many more than three cell types. Consistent with this idea, we found that B cells can be separated into different types based on their physiological response to volatile amines. This is revealed in Ir25a mutant animals, where the response to amines is abolished in most B cells, but a subset of neurons retains their responses. We found that Ir76b is expressed in a subset of the Or8 -expressing B cells, as are Ir161 and Ir41a . It is possible that these IRs mediate amine responses in the subset of Ir25a mutant neurons that retain amine responses.
We hypothesize that receptor co-expression is used broadly to detect redundant cues that are present in human odor, a blend that can vary from individual to individual and contains hundreds of different chemicals ( Bernier et al., 1999 8. Bernier, U.R. ∙ Booth, M.M. ∙ Yost, R.A. Analysis of human skin emanations by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. 1.

Differential mosquito attraction to humans is associated with skin-derived carboxylic acid levels Preprint at bioRxiv. 2022; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). Both volatile amines and 1-octen-3-ol are emitted from human skin ( Bernier et al., 2000 9. Bernier, U.R. ∙ Kline, D.L. ∙ Barnard, D.R. ...

A review of the volatiles from the healthy human body J. Breath Res. 2014; 8 :014001 Crossref Scopus (614) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is possible that receptor co-expression is used to form a highly redundant detection system for different cues that represent the same ecological target: humans. This motif has the benefit of limiting the number of neurons needed to detect varied odorants with the same meaning. Our study reveals unexpected complexity in the gene expression and functional organization of the mosquito olfactory system that may explain the persistence of mosquitoes in hunting humans. Future attempts to design repellents to ward off mosquitoes or attractant traps to lure them will have to have to reckon with the complexity of this system.
We see a variety of OR and IR expression levels in different neurons and have not determined the impact of expression level on in vivo receptor function in individual neurons. This study examined the role of receptor co-expression on odor-evoked activity in only a single type of neuron, and odorants were applied above the physiological concentration in human odor. For the snRNA-seq data, we established discrete criteria for expression. However different receptor gene expression levels vary continuously both in individual cells as well as in the tissue at large. This complicates setting a single threshold for determining functional expression for different receptors, especially for those that are rarer or expressed at lower levels. For the mosquito antenna, we lacked validated markers of tissue composition or cell types other than neurons to objectively assess analysis pipeline decisions. Future research into cell populations in the antenna may provide data to further “ground truth” and refine this analysis pipeline. While many of the techniques we used produced consistent results, we sometimes observed inconsistencies in the snRNA-seq data, such as low levels of Orco expression in the maxillary palp Gr3 cluster, an observation at odds with results from the three other methods used in the paper and one that we do not currently understand but that could be due to differences in the sensitivity of detection methods.

Plasmids generated in this study have been deposited to Addgene (accession #162520–162526).
Blood-feeding procedures and behavioral experiments with live hosts were approved and monitored by The Rockefeller University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC protocol 17,018) and Institutional Review Board (IRB protocol LV-0652), respectively. Human volunteers gave their written informed consent to participate.
Ae. aegypti wild-type laboratory strains (Liverpool and Orlando), CRISPR-Cas9 knock-in, and piggyBAC QUAS transgenic strains were maintained and reared at 25–28°C, 70–80% relative humidity with a photoperiod of 14 h light: 10 h dark as previously described ( DeGennaro et al., 2013 27. DeGennaro, M. ∙ McBride, C.S. ∙ Seeholzer, L. ... orco mutant mosquitoes lose strong preference for humans and are not repelled by volatile DEET Nature. 2013; 498 :487-491 Crossref Scopus (248) PubMed Google Scholar ). Adult mosquitoes were provided constant access to 10% sucrose. For routine strain maintenance, animals were primarily blood-fed on live mice and occasionally on live human volunteers. Newly generated strains were blood-fed on human volunteers until they were established. All experiments except those in Figures 2 J–2T were conducted on adult female mosquitoes. Detailed genotypes used in each figure can be found in Data S1 .
T2A - QF2 gene-sparing stop codon replacement lines were generated using the strategy outlined in Matthews et al. (2019) 68. Matthews, B.J. ∙ Younger, M.A. ∙ Vosshall, L.B. The ion channel ppk301 controls freshwater egg-laying in the mosquito Aedes aegypti Elife. 2019; 8 :e43963 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar . sgRNAs were placed as close to the stop codon as possible and donor constructs were designed to remove the stop codon and replace it with an in-frame cassette containing the T2A ribosomal skipping sequence and the QF2 transcription factor or Split- QF2 domains, comprising the QF2 activation domain QF2-AD , or the QF2 DNA-binding domain QF2-DBD . This strategy spares the function of the gene at the locus being targeted, expresses QF2 or Split- QF2 domains in the cells specified by enhancers at the locus. Insertions were marked by the 3xP3 enhancer expressing a fluorescent protein. To identify effective sgRNAs, 5 candidate sgRNAs per gene were first injected into separate pools of 500 Liverpool embryos and CRISPR-Cas9-mediated cut rate was evaluated as previously described ( Kistler et al., 2015 53. Kistler, K. ∙ Vosshall, L. ∙ Matthews, B. Genome engineering with CRISPR-Cas9 in the mosquito Aedes aegypti Cell Rep. 2015; 11 :51-60 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (220) PubMed Google Scholar ). Either a single sgRNA or 2 sgRNAs with the highest cut rates were then chosen to be injected with donor plasmids to target chemosensory gene loci using homology-directed repair. sgRNAs targeted the respective gene near the stop codon, target sequence with protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) underlined: Ir25a : GTTTGTGTGCGTGTCCGTA TGG Ir76b : GTATTACACTTATCTAAATA TGG Ir8a : GTCACGCTTGTTGTACAGGG CGG , GAACAATTTGAACAAGGTCG TGG Gr3 : GTTAGTGATGCATAATATGA CGG Orco : GTCACCTACTTCATGGTGT TGG
sgRNA DNA template was prepared by annealing oligonucleotides as described ( Kistler et al., 2015 53. Kistler, K. ∙ Vosshall, L. ∙ Matthews, B. Genome engineering with CRISPR-Cas9 in the mosquito Aedes aegypti Cell Rep. 2015; 11 :51-60 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (220) PubMed Google Scholar ). In vitro transcription was performed using HiScribe Quick T7 kit (NEB E2050S) following the manufacturer’s directions. Following transcription and DNAse treatment for 15 min at 37°C, sgRNA was purified using RNAse-free SPRI beads (Ampure RNAclean, Beckman-Coulter A63987), and eluted in Ultrapure water (Invitrogen, 10,977–015).
Donor plasmids were constructed by Gibson assembly using the following fragments for QF2 lines: 1) pUC19 digested with XbaI and BamHI 2) Left and right homology arms: Gr3 (left: 1.9 kb, right: 1.6 kb), Ir25a (left: 1.8 kb, right: 1.6 kb), Ir76b (left: 1.2 kb, right: 2.2 kb), Ir8a (left: 1.7 kb, right: 1.7 kb), Orco (left: 1.2 kb, right: 1.3 kb) generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using Liverpool genomic DNA as a template 3) A 2.6 kb fragment containing T2A-QF2-SV40, 3xP3-dsRed , PCR-amplified from a previously assembled vector ( ppk10779-T2A-QF2-SV40, 3xP3-dsRed , Addgene accession #130667)
For Split-QF2 lines, donor plasmids were constructed by generating fragments using PCR from the indicated template with indicated primers in Data S1 and assembled using NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly (NEB E5520S):
Ir25a-T2A-QFAD::Zip+-SV40-3xP3-eYFP-SV40 was composed of: 1 Plasmid backbone with Ir25 homology arms from Ir25a-T2A-QF2 plasmid (6 kb) 2 T2A-QFAD::Zip+-SV40 sequence from ( Riabinina et al., 2019 88. Riabinina, O. ∙ Vernon, S.W. ∙ Dickson, B.J. ... Split-QF system for fine-tuned transgene expression in Drosophila Genetics. 2019; 212 :53-63 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ), fragment synthesized by Genewiz, sequence in Data S1 (1.5 kb) 3 3xP3-EYFP-SV40 from pDSAY (Addgene, #62291) (1.2 kb)
Orco-T2A-Zip−::QFDBD-SV40-3xP3-dsRED-SV40 was composed of: 1 Plasmid backbone with Orco homology arms and 3xP3-dsRED-SV40 from Orco-T2A-QF2 plasmid (6.3 kb) 2 T2A-Zip−::QFDBD-SV40 synthesized by Genewiz, sequence in Data S1 (1.5 kb)
For all QF2 and Split- QF2 constructs, the stop codon of the endogenous gene was removed and the PAM sequences corresponding to the sgRNAs used for injection were modified by PCR mutagenesis during Gibson assembly by introducing synonymous codon substitutions to protect the sequence from Cas9 cleavage while retaining the amino acid identity. Plasmids were isolated using an endotoxin-free plasmid midiprep kit (Macherey-Nagel) for QF2 lines and NucleoBond Xtra Midi Endotoxin-Free plasmid kit (Clontech 740,420.50) for Split-QF2 lines and eluted in ultrapure water prior to injection. Donor plasmids are available at Addgene (accession numbers #162520–162526). Approximately 2,000 wild-type Liverpool strain Ae. aegypti embryos were injected with a mix containing recombinant Cas9 protein (PNA Bio, CP01) at 300 ng/μL, sgRNAs at 40 ng/μL and donor DNA plasmid (300 ng/μL for QF2 lines, 600 ng/μL for Split-QF2 lines) at the Insect Transformation Facility at the University of Maryland Institute for Bioscience & Biotechnology Research. Embryos were hatched and surviving G0 males and females were crossed to wild-type Liverpool mosquitoes and their G1 offspring were screened for fluorescence indicating positive stable germ line transformants. For QF2 lines, the fidelity of insertion was verified by PCR and Sanger sequencing. One representative line for each chemosensory receptor QF2 knock-in was selected for further study. QF2-driven expression patterns were examined by crossing to QUAS-CD8:GFP-3xP3-ECFP and/or QUAS-dTomato-T2A-GCaMP6s-3xP3-ECFP .
A technical problem arose in the construction of the QUAS-dTomato-T2A-GCaMP6s-3xP3-ECFP plasmid that caused only a single copy of dTomato to be introduced into the mosquito, rather than the brighter tandem dTomato or tdTomato that is more conventionally used. Nevertheless we found that dTomato is sufficiently bright for our experiments ( Shaner et al., 2004 99. Shaner, N.C. ∙ Campbell, R.E. ∙ Steinbach, P.A. ... Improved monomeric red, orange and yellow fluorescent proteins derived from Discosoma sp. red fluorescent protein Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22 :1567-1572 Crossref Scopus (3440) PubMed Google Scholar ).
All lines were outcrossed to wild-type Liverpool mosquitoes for at least 3 generations prior to being used in experiments. For Split-QF2 lines, a single family with the correct insertion was confirmed by PCR and Sanger sequencing for Ir25a-QF2-AD and Orco-QF2-DBD . To propagate these lines, a male founder was chosen to cross to wild-type Liverpool females. Animals were then back-crossed to Liverpool for at least 2 additional generations. To evaluate if the Split-QF2 system was functional in Ae. aegypti , Ir25a-QF2-AD was crossed to QUAS-dTomato-T2A-GCaMP6s. The resulting Ir25a-QF2-AD, QUAS-dTomato-T2A-GCaMP6s animals were then crossed to Orco-QF2-DBD . Expression of the dTomato reporter was observed in larval antennae and subsequently confirmed in adult antennae and brains.
QUAS-CD8:GFP-3xP3-ECFP and QUAS-dTomato-T2A-GCaMP6s-3xP3-ECFP transgenic strains were described previously ( Matthews et al., 2019 68. Matthews, B.J. ∙ Younger, M.A. ∙ Vosshall, L.B. The ion channel ppk301 controls freshwater egg-laying in the mosquito Aedes aegypti Elife. 2019; 8 :e43963 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Two independent insertions of the QUAS-dTomato-T2A-GCaMP6s-3xP3-ECFP reporter line ( Jové et al., 2020 51. Jové, V. ∙ Gong, Z. ∙ Hol, F.J. ...

The ion channel ppk301 controls freshwater egg-laying in the mosquito Aedes aegypti Elife. 2019; 8 :e43963 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) were used in this study. These are located on different chromosomes and were used according to the crossing scheme needed for a given experiment. See Data S1 for details.
The three chemosensory receptors mutant strains used in this study was previously described: Ir25a BamHI/BamHI ( De Obaldia et al., 2022 26. De Obaldia, M.E. ∙ Morita, T. ∙ Dedmon, L.C. ... Differential mosquito attraction to humans is associated with skin-derived carboxylic acid levels Preprint at bioRxiv. 2022; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ), Gr3 4/4 ( McMeniman et al., 2014 74. McMeniman, C. ∙ Corfas, R. ∙ Matthews, B. ... Multimodal integration of carbon dioxide and other sensory cues drives mosquito attraction to humans Cell. 2014; 156 :1060-1071 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (239) PubMed Google Scholar ), Orco 16/16 ( DeGennaro et al., 2013 27. DeGennaro, M. ∙ McBride, C.S. ∙ Seeholzer, L. ... orco mutant mosquitoes lose strong preference for humans and are not repelled by volatile DEET Nature. 2013; 498 :487-491 Crossref Scopus (248) PubMed Google Scholar ). Gr3 4/4 and Orco 16/16 were generated in the Orlando background (here referred to as +/+ ORL ) and the Ir25a BamHI/BamHI mutant was generated in the Liverpool background (here referred to as +/+ LVP ). To account for possible difference in genetic background the +/+ ORL strain was used as the controls in all experiments where the Gr3 4/4 and Orco 16/16 mutants were used, and the +/+ LVP strain was used as the control in experiments where the Ir25a BamHI/BamHI mutant was used.
Expression values for adult sugar-fed, non-blood-fed female sensory tissues were retrieved from the Ae. aegypti L5 genome GitHub repository ( https://github.com/VosshallLab/AGWG-AaegL5 ) at this link: https://github.com/VosshallLab/AGWG-AaegL5/raw/master/AGWG%20AaegL5%20Chemoreceptor%20TPM.xlsx . These expression values reflect libraries from a previous transcriptome study ( Matthews et al., 2016 67. Matthews, B.J. ∙ McBride, C.S. ∙ DeGennaro, M. ... The neurotranscriptome of the Aedes aegypti mosquito BMC Genom. 2016; 17 :32 Crossref Scopus (110) PubMed Google Scholar ) that had been aligned to the Ae. aegypti genome (AaegL5) and chemosensory receptor geneset annotation reported in units of Transcripts Per Million (TPM) ( Matthews et al., 2018 66. Matthews, B.J. ∙ Dudchenko, O. ∙ Kingan, S.B. ... Improved reference genome of Aedes aegypti informs arbovirus vector control Nature. 2018; 563 :501-507 Crossref Scopus (218) PubMed Google Scholar ). The number of genes from each of three gene families (ORs, IRs, and GRs) with expression values above the indicated threshold were plotted in Figures 1 F and 1G and are available in Data S1 .
Dissection of adult brains and immunofluorescence was carried out as previously described ( Matthews et al., 2019 68. Matthews, B.J. ∙ Younger, M.A. ∙ Vosshall, L.B. The ion channel ppk301 controls freshwater egg-laying in the mosquito Aedes aegypti Elife. 2019; 8 :e43963 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). 6-14-day-old mosquitoes were anesthetized on wet ice. Heads were carefully removed from the body by pinching at the neck with sharp forceps. Heads were placed in a 1.5 mL tube for fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.1 M Millonig’s Phosphate Buffer (pH 7.4), 0.25% Triton X-100, and nutated for 3 h. Brains were then dissected out of the head capsule in ice-cold Ca +2 -, Mg +2 -free PBS (PBS, Lonza 17-517Q) and transferred to a 24-well plate. All subsequent steps were done on a low-speed orbital shaker. Brains were washed in PBS containing 0.25% Triton X-100 (PBT) at room temperature 6 times for 15 min. Brains were permeabilized with PBS, 4% Triton X-100, 2% normal goat serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch #005-000-121) for ∼48 h (2 nights) at 4 °C. Brains were rinsed once and then washed with PBT at room temperature 6 times for 15 min. Primary antibodies were diluted in PBS, 0.25% Triton X-100, 2% normal goat serum for ∼48 h (2 nights) at 4 °C. Brains were rinsed once then washed in PBT at room temperature 6 times for 15 min. Secondary antibodies were diluted in PBS, 0.25% Triton X-100, 2% normal goat serum for ∼48 h (2 nights) at 4 °C. Brains were rinsed once then washed in PBT at room temperature 6 times for 15 min. Brains were equilibrated overnight in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories H-1000) and were mounted in Vectashield. The following primary antibodies were used: anti-Brp/nc82 (mouse; 1:50, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank – see below) and/or anti-GFP (rabbit: 1:10,000; Life Technologies A-11122). The secondary antibodies used in all experiments except Figures S1 A and S1P were anti-mouse-Cy5 (1:250; Life Technologies A-10524) and anti-rabbit-Alexa Fluor 488 (1:500; Life Technologies A-11034). In Figures S1 A and S1P, the secondary antibody was anti-mouse-Alexa Fluor 488 (1:500; Life Technologies A-11001) and in Figures S1 A and S1P, the secondary antibodies were anti-mouse-Alexa Fluor 594 (1:500; Life Technologies A-11005) and anti-rabbit-Alexa Fluor 488 (1:500; Life Technologies A-11034).
Hybridoma cells expressing monoclonal antibody nc82 (Antibody Registry ID: AB_2314866), which recognizes the D. melanogaster Brp protein ( Wagh et al., 2006 118. Wagh, D.A. ∙ Rasse, T.M. ∙ Asan, E. ... Bruchpilot, a protein with homology to ELKS/CAST, is required for structural integrity and function of synaptic active zones in Drosophila Neuron. 2006; 51 :275 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (5) Google Scholar ) developed by Erich Buchner were obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, created by the NICHD of the NIH and maintained at The University of Iowa, Department of Biology, Iowa City, IA 52242. Frances Weis-Garcia and the members of the MSKCC Antibody and Bioresource Core Facility subsequently used these hybridoma cells to purify this monoclonal antibody. The hybridoma was adapted to Gibco Hybridoma-SFM (Cat # 12,045,084) and 1% fetal bovine serum prescreened for ultra-low levels of bovine Ig. Antibody expression was confirmed and the adapted hybridoma was inoculated into the cell compartment of the Corning CELLine Disposable Bioreactor (Cat # 353,137) in 15 mL of Hybridoma-SFM + 0.5% fetal bovine serum (production media) at 3 million viable cells/ml. The media compartment of the flask contained 350 mL of production media. The bioreactor was incubated at 37°C with 7% CO 2 for 3 days, at which time the cells and media containing nc82 were harvested. 30 million viable cells from the harvest were re-inoculated back into the cell compartment in 30 mL fresh production media. The media in the media compartment was replaced the following day with 650 mL production media. Three days later, the media in the media compartment was replaced with 1,000 mL production media, with the next harvest 3 days later (7 days after the previous harvest). Cells were harvested weekly and fed biweekly until the desired amount of monoclonal antibody was reached. After the first harvest, each one contained about 3 mg of monoclonal antibody nc82/mL production media. The harvests to be purified were pooled, centrifuged at 12,855 x g for 15 min 6.5 mg/run were loaded onto a Cytiva (formerly GE Life Sciences) 1 mL HiTrap Protein G HP antibody purification column (Cat # 29,048,581) at 1 mL/min. The column was then washed with 0.02 M Sodium Phosphate (pH 7.0) before the monoclonal antibody was eluted with 0.1 M Glycine-HCl (pH 2.7). One mL fractions were collected and immediately neutralized with 60 mL of 1.0 M Tris-HCl (pH 9.0). The harvest, flow through and fractions from the peak were run on an a 10% SDS-PAGE (Bio-Rad Cat # 345-0010) to confirm purity and determine which should be pooled. The pooled fractions of monoclonal antibody were dialyzed into PBS overnight using dialysis tubing (Spectrum 132,544) with a 50 kDa MWCO. Another 10% SDS-PAGE was run, and the concentration determined using the absorbance at 280 using an extinction coefficient of 1.43.
Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were raised against Ir25a by Proteintech Group Inc. Antibodies were raised against a protein fusion of the 67 C-terminal amino acids of Ir25a and glutathione S-transferase. cDNA corresponding to the C-terminal region was inserted into the expression vector PGEX-4T using primers TTTTGGATCCAAATACCGCAAGAACGTAAAG and TTTTCTCGAGTTAGAAACGAGATTTAAAGTTG and expressed in bacterial strain BL21. A purified 31 kDA fusion protein was used to immunize 2 rabbits. Serum was affinity purified to a final concentration of 450 μg/mL and tested by whole mount antenna immunofluorescence comparing +/+ LVP to Ir25a BamHI/BamHI . Antibodies from one of the two rabbits were found to selectively label +/+ LVP antennae, and only this antibody was used in all further studies.
All brains were imaged using a Zeiss Inverted LSM 880 laser scanning confocal microscope with a 25x/0.8 NA immersion-corrected objective unless otherwise noted. Glycerol was used as the immersion medium to most closely match the refractive index of the mounting medium Vectashield. Antennal lobes in Figures 1 , 2 , 5 , S1 , S2 , S3 , and S4 were imaged at either 1024 x 1024 or 2048 x 2048 pixel resolution in X and Y with 0.5 μm Z-steps for a final voxel size of either 0.0615 × 0.0615 × 0.5 μm 3 or 0.1230 × 0.1230 × 0.5 μm 3 . Both conditions oversampled relative to the objective resolution and no differences were noted between imaging conditions. The laser intensity and gain were adjusted along the z axis to account for a loss of intensity due to depth and care was taken to avoid saturation and ensure that the deepest glomeruli were visible for segmentation. We note that all confocal imaging was conducted in a manner that would maximize our ability to visualize the boundaries between glomeruli and to determine the presence or absence of a given fluorophore in each glomerulus, and was not intended as a quantitative measure of fluorescence intensity. 3xP3 was used as a promoter to express fluorescent proteins as markers for the knock-ins and QUAS transgenes used in this study, and care was taken to distinguish expression derived from the 3XP3 promoter from the expression of the QF2 driver and QUAS effector lines under investigation. 3xP3 drives expression in the optic lobes, as well as some cells in the dorsal brain. Neither area overlaps with the antennal lobes. As reported previously ( Matthews et al., 2019 68. Matthews, B.J. ∙ Younger, M.A. ∙ Vosshall, L.B. The ion channel ppk301 controls freshwater egg-laying in the mosquito Aedes aegypti Elife. 2019; 8 :e43963 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), we saw no 3xP3 -driven expression in the antennal lobes in the reporter lines alone (data not shown). Representative antennal lobe images presented in the figures were cropped to remove 3xP3 -driven expression elsewhere in the brain.
All male brains ( Figure 2 M, 2O, 2Q, 2S, and 2U) and all female subesophageal zones ( Figure S4 G) were imaged using a Zeiss Inverted LSM 880 laser scanning confocal microscope with a 25x/0.8 NA immersion-corrected objective. Glycerol was used as the immersion medium to most closely match the refractive index of the mounting medium Vectashield. Brains were imaged at 1024 x 1024 pixel resolution in X and Y with 0.5 μm Z-steps for a final voxel size of 0.2372 × 0.2372 × 0.5 μm 3 (male brain) or 0.2076 × 0.2076 × 0.5 μm 3 (female subesophageal zone). The laser intensity and gain were adjusted along the z axis to account for a loss of intensity due to depth and care was taken to avoid saturation and ensure that the deepest regions of the brain were visible. Confocal images of the brain were processed in ImageJ/FIJI (NIH) ( Schindelin et al., 2012 96. Schindelin, J. ∙ Arganda-Carreras, I. ∙ Frise, E. ... Fiji: an open-source platform for biological-image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :676-682 Crossref Scopus (28202) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Ir25a -expressing neurons send extensive projections to the subesophageal zone, with axons terminating in the anterior and posterior regions. There is a small cluster of glomeruli in the central subesophageal zone that receives dense innervation as well ( Figure S4 ). Orco -expressing neurons do not project to the anterior region and send sparse projections to the posterior subesophageal zone and subesophageal zone glomeruli ( Figure S4 ). Innervation by the neurons that co-express Orco and Ir25a send projections only to the posterior-ventral subesophageal zone, with the densest innervation in the medial region and sparser lateral arborizations ( Figure S4 ). Ir25a complexes can mediate detection of volatile odorants and gustatory cues.
Confocal images of the antennal lobes in Figures 1 , 2 , 5 , S1 , S2 , S3 , and S4 were processed in ImageJ/FIJI (NIH) ( Schindelin et al., 2012 96. Schindelin, J. ∙ Arganda-Carreras, I. ∙ Frise, E. ... Fiji: an open-source platform for biological-image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :676-682 Crossref Scopus (28202) PubMed Google Scholar ). The number of glomeruli was quantified as follows: a single region of interest (ROI) was manually drawn around each glomerulus at a section approximately central along the z axis. Every glomerulus was outlined and an ROI set was collected that contained the outlines of all glomeruli. Glomeruli were then separated into two groups, GFP-positive and GFP-negative glomeruli, as determined by eye. A count of each was made to determine the number of glomeruli labeled by each line as well as the total number of glomeruli. The ROIs were flattened along the z axis to enable representation of the data in two dimensions in Figures 1 , 2 , S1 , S2 , S3 , and S4 . The left antennal lobe in 3 brains was analyzed for each genotype in Figure 1 except for Gr3 , for which the left antennal lobe was analyzed in 1 brain, and both left and right antennal lobes were analyzed in an additional 4 brains in Figure S1 . Although we were able to recognize general regions of the antennal lobe, the interindividual variability made it impossible to identify most glomeruli by shape alone. We therefore have not attempted to name and number every glomerulus in Ae. aegypti as has been done in previous studies ( Ignell et al., 2005 46. Ignell, R. ∙ Dekker, T. ∙ Ghaninia, M. ...

While Shankar and McMeniman renamed most antennal lobe regions and glomeruli, they chose not to rename the MD (Medio-Dorsal) cluster of glomeruli comprising MD1, MD2, and MD3 whose sensory input derives from the maxillary palp. We have observed in our study that the MD glomeruli are medial, but they are not notably dorsal, and therefore refer to them as Glomerulus 1, Glomerulus 2, and Glomerulus 3 in this paper for simplicity. While there is utility in naming glomeruli, we suspect that the Ae. aegypti mosquito antennal lobe atlas will be refined in the future with the advent of new genetic tools that will unambiguously allow the field to distinguish and name genetically identifiable glomeruli. We found that the size, shape, and number of antennal lobe glomeruli in Ae. aegypti was variable from animal to animal. It is possible that the boundaries between glomeruli are not easily distinguished by synaptic staining and that specific glomeruli will become identifiable once there are genetic tools available that label smaller populations of OSNs. The anatomical variability we see is consistent with both the original map that identified 50 glomeruli ( Ignell et al., 2005 46. Ignell, R. ∙ Dekker, T. ∙ Ghaninia, M. ... Neuronal architecture of the mosquito deutocerebrum J. Comp. Neurol. 2005; 493 :207-240 Crossref Scopus (104) PubMed Google Scholar ), which divided glomeruli into 3 classes based on their variability in location, as well as a recent study that looked specifically at the size and shape of glomeruli across animals ( Shankar and McMeniman, 2020 100. Shankar, S. ∙ McMeniman, C.J. An updated antennal lobe atlas for the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2020; 14 :e0008729 Crossref Scopus (4) PubMed Google Scholar ) and revised the original map to a count of ∼80 glomeruli. Shankar and McMeniman named and numbered these glomeruli across animals, but they noted that they were only able to consistently identify 63 glomeruli. This is similar to the ∼65 glomeruli we observed in our work. While there is not yet a clear consensus on the exact number of antennal lobe glomeruli in Ae. aegypti , the number of chemosensory receptors expressed in the antenna and maxillary palp is at least twice as large as any of the estimates of glomerulus number. The variability in antennal lobe structure appears at first to contrast with D. melanogaster , where each glomerulus can be clearly identified and named. However, we note that the antennal lobe map in D. melanogaster has been refined with the advent of new genetic techniques, starting with 35 glomeruli in the original atlas ( Stocker et al., 1990 104. Stocker, R.F. ∙ Lienhard, M.C. ∙ Borst, A. ... Neuronal architecture of the antennal lobe in Drosophila melanogaster Cell Tissue Res. 1990; 262 :9-34 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), then modified to 40 glomeruli ( Laissue et al., 1999 58. Laissue, P.P. ∙ Reiter, C. ∙ Hiesinger, P.R. ... Three-dimensional reconstruction of the antennal lobe in Drosophila melanogaster J. Comp. Neurol. 1999; 405 :543-552 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), and further refined in numerous studies ( Couto et al., 2005 23. Couto, A. ∙ Alenius, M. ∙ Dickson, B.J.

Biol. 2005; 15 :1535-1547 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (656) PubMed Google Scholar ; Fishilevich and Vosshall, 2005 31. Fishilevich, E. ∙ Vosshall, L.B.

Neurol. 2012; 520 :4067-4130 Crossref Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ) including a recent count of 54 ( Grabe et al., 2015 39. Grabe, V. ∙ Strutz, A. ∙ Baschwitz, A. ... Digital in vivo 3D atlas of the antennal lobe of Drosophila melanogaster J. Comp. Neurol. 2015; 523 :530-544 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ) and 58 ( Task et al., 2022 109. Task, D. ∙ Lin, C.C. ∙ Vulpe, A. ... Chemoreceptor co-expression in Drosophila melanogaster olfactory neurons Elife. 2022; 11 :e72599 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) glomeruli. We have refrained from naming glomeruli in Ae. aegypti at this time because we believe that a more stereotyped arrangement will emerge as new genetic lines are generated that allow cell-type-specific labeling. A recent study in the mosquito An. gambiae using mosquitoes that label Orco -expressing olfactory neurons also noted that the antennal lobe was variable between animals relative to D. melanogaster ( Riabinina et al., 2016 87. Riabinina, O. ∙ Task, D. ∙ Marr, E. ... Organization of olfactory centres in the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 :13010 Crossref Scopus (77) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is therefore possible that mosquito antennal lobes are more variable than Drosophilids ( Grabe et al., 2015 39. Grabe, V. ∙ Strutz, A. ∙ Baschwitz, A. ... Digital in vivo 3D atlas of the antennal lobe of Drosophila melanogaster J. Comp. Neurol. 2015; 523 :530-544 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ; Prieto-Godino et al., 2017 81.

Evolution of acid-sensing olfactory circuits in Drosophilids Neuron. 2017; 93 :661-676.e6 e666 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (85) PubMed Google Scholar ). Variability in olfactory bulb structure is seen even in the mouse, Mus musculus, where the principles of olfactory organization were first established ( Schaefer et al., 2001 95. Schaefer, M.L. ∙ Finger, T.E. ∙ Restrepo, D. Variability of position of the P2 glomerulus within a map of the mouse olfactory bulb J. Comp. Neurol. 2001; 436 :351-362 Crossref Scopus (95) PubMed Google Scholar ; Strotmann et al., 2000 105. Strotmann, J. ∙ Conzelmann, S. ∙ Beck, A. ... Local permutations in the glomerular array of the mouse olfactory bulb J. Neurosci. 2000; 20 :6927-6938 Crossref Scopus (181) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zou et al., 2009 127.

The exact size and location of glomeruli can vary between animals more than initially appreciated and appears to be determined by both genetic factors and activity in OSNs during the early life of the animal. In D. melanogaster , glomerulus size is highly genetically determined and correlates strongly with the number of OSNs that innervates each glomerulus ( Grabe et al., 2015 39. Grabe, V. ∙ Strutz, A. ∙ Baschwitz, A. ... Digital in vivo 3D atlas of the antennal lobe of Drosophila melanogaster J. Comp. Neurol. 2015; 523 :530-544 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ). Whether the variability in glomerulus size in the mosquito is due to activity-dependent changes in structure or other factors remains to be seen.
Orco-QF2>QUAS-mCD8:GFP . We noted that the intensity of GFP varies between glomeruli in this driver line, with some bright and others comparably dim. We speculate that this is due to a combination of the variability in Orco expression levels in individual neurons and variability in the density of innervation in individual glomeruli. A large region of the anterior ventral antennal lobe was previously referred to as the Johnston’s organ center and was thought to comprise a single large glomerulus ( Ignell et al., 2005 46. Ignell, R. ∙ Dekker, T. ∙ Ghaninia, M. ... Neuronal architecture of the mosquito deutocerebrum J. Comp. Neurol. 2005; 493 :207-240 Crossref Scopus (104) PubMed Google Scholar ). In other insect species, Johnston’s organ mediates detection of auditory cues. Consistent with a recent study ( Shankar and McMeniman, 2020 100. Shankar, S. ∙ McMeniman, C.J. An updated antennal lobe atlas for the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2020; 14 :e0008729 Crossref Scopus (4) PubMed Google Scholar ), we segmented this region into multiple glomeruli based on anatomical boundaries revealed with Brp immunofluorescence. Glomeruli in this region are innervated by Orco -expressing neurons, calling into doubt the original report that these glomeruli process auditory stimuli and suggesting instead that they serve an olfactory function. In support of this hypothesis, the analogous area of the An. coluzzii antennal lobe has been shown to receive projections from Orco -expressing OSNs ( Riabinina et al., 2016 87. Riabinina, O. ∙ Task, D. ∙ Marr, E. ... Organization of olfactory centres in the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 :13010 Crossref Scopus (77) PubMed Google Scholar ). We also observed GFP projections into the subesophageal zone in Orco-QF2>QUAS-mCD8:GFP animals, which appear to derive from expression in the proboscis, the primary taste organ in insects. This is consistent with similar expression in An. coluzzii ( Riabinina et al., 2016 87. Riabinina, O. ∙ Task, D. ∙ Marr, E. ... Organization of olfactory centres in the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 :13010 Crossref Scopus (77) PubMed Google Scholar ) and functional data in An. gambiae showing that olfactory responses are detected in this gustatory organ ( Kwon et al., 2006 56. Kwon, H.W. ∙ Lu, T. ∙ Rutzler, M. ... Olfactory responses in a gustatory organ of the malaria vector mosquito Anopheles gambiae Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U S A. 2006; 103 :13526-13531 Crossref Scopus (104) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Ir25a-QF2>QUAS-mCD8:GFP . The intensity of GFP projections varies between glomeruli in this driver line, with some bright and other comparably dim, as noted for Orco-QF2 . The brightest glomeruli are primarily medial and anterior. We see the dimmest innervation in the area previously described as Johnston’s organ center as well as in the central antennal lobe. Labeling was also seen in other areas of the brain, most notably the subesophageal zone and anterior mechanosensory motor center.
Ir8a-QF2>QUAS-mCD8:GFP . Depending on the brain being analyzed there were either 2 or 3 medial glomeruli labeled in this line. In the cases where there were 3 medial glomeruli, this third medial glomerulus was innervated by a few large-diameter axons. These were larger and sparser than the smaller axons that densely innervated most other glomeruli in this line. We also note that there are 2–3 cell bodies that express GFP located in the cell body rind lateral to the antennal lobe (rALl). We are unable to definitively describe where these cells project without genetic reagents that selectively label these cells, but they appear to send bilateral processes that cross the midline within what appears to be the saddle to innervate the anterior mechanosensory motor center outside the antennal lobe. All naming is in accordance with the new insect brain nomenclature presented in Ito et al. (2014) 48. Ito, K. ∙ Shinomiya, K. ∙ Ito, M. ... A systematic nomenclature for the insect brain Neuron. 2014; 81 :755-765 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (369) PubMed Google Scholar .
Ir76b-QF2>QUAS-mCD8:GFP . In addition to projections to the antennal lobe, this line shows innervation of the subesophageal zone of the brain.
Gr3-QF2>QUAS-mCD8:GFP . All antennal lobes in this line show innervation of a single glomerulus (also referred to as ”MD1″ and here referred to as “Glomerulus 1”; ( Ignell et al., 2005 46. Ignell, R. ∙ Dekker, T. ∙ Ghaninia, M. ... Neuronal architecture of the mosquito deutocerebrum J. Comp. Neurol. 2005; 493 :207-240 Crossref Scopus (104) PubMed Google Scholar ; Shankar and McMeniman, 2020 100. Shankar, S. ∙ McMeniman, C.J. An updated antennal lobe atlas for the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2020; 14 :e0008729 Crossref Scopus (4) PubMed Google Scholar ). In several brains, we saw a second small medial glomerulus that derives its innervation from the antenna and is in a small medial cluster of landmark glomeruli midway down the anterior-posterior axis closest to the center of the brain. Innervation appears to come from only a few axons. This low and variable reporter expression is consistent with the low level of expression of Gr3 in the antennal transcriptome ( Matthews et al., 2016 67. Matthews, B.J. ∙ McBride, C.S. ∙ DeGennaro, M. ... The neurotranscriptome of the Aedes aegypti mosquito BMC Genom. 2016; 17 :32 Crossref Scopus (110) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because this line only shows innervation of these 1–2 glomeruli, we analyzed all glomeruli only in the single brain in Figure 1 I, and additionally analyzed 8 more antennal lobes in 4 brains for the presence or absence of labeling in these two glomeruli. We analyzed both left and right antennal lobes from 4 brains and found that in 3 of the 4 brains there was a second glomerulus in one or both antennal lobes ( Figure S1 ). The presence of the second glomerulus was not specific within a single animal as we found all variations of presence and absence of this glomerulus across both antennal lobes in these 4 animals. In some Gr3-QF2>QUAS-mCD8:GFP animals, we detected a small number of processes that extended beyond the antennal lobe and into the higher brain, although the exact termination site varied. We never saw CO 2 -evoked activity in the variable second glomerulus or these projections outside the antennal lobe. Images in Figure S1 were taken as described above with the following changes: Secondary antibodies used were anti-mouse-Alexa Fluor 594 (1:500; Life Technologies A-11005) and anti-Rabbit-Alexa Fluor 488 (1:500; Life Technologies A-11034). Images were taken using a Zeiss Inverted LSM 880 laser scanning confocal microscope with a Plan-Apochromat 40x/1.4 Oil DIC objective. Images were taken at 1024 x 1024 in XY to generate images with a final voxel size of 0.1384 × 0.1384 × 0.5 μm 3 . Images were scored as containing GFP in one or two glomeruli.
All antennal lobe immunofluorescence in Figures 2 , 5 , and S4 was carried out as described above with slight modifications to utilize the 15xQUAS-dTomato-T2A-GCaMP6s effector line. The same primary antibodies were used because of the structural similarity between GCaMP6s and GFP. Intrinsic dTomato was detected without antibody amplification, as it retained fluorescence after fixation and staining. Brp (Cy5), dTomato, and GCaMP6s (Alexa Fluor 488) were imaged as three separate confocal channels as described above. Glomeruli labeled by dTomato completely overlapped with those labeled by GCaMP6s immunofluorescence, so both channels were used during the quantification of positive and negative glomeruli. dTomato labeling was used to generate sample images. There was no staining in the antennal lobes of the individual split effector lines crossed to 15xQUAS-dTomato-T2A-GCaMP6s (n = 3 per genotype) ( Figures 2 and S4 ).
For images in Figure S1 , mosquitoes were anesthetized on wet ice until immobile and then transferred to a cold dissection dish. A single antenna or maxillary palp was loaded with Texas red conjugated dextran (Molecular Probes D3328) diluted 10 mg in 100 μL external saline (103 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 5 mM 2-[Tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl]-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid (TES), 1.5 mM CaCl 2 , 4 mM MgCl 2 , 26 mM NaHCO 3 , 1 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 10 mM trehalose, 10 mM glucose, pH 7.3, osmolality adjusted to 275 mOsm/kg). To load the dye a small drop (approximately 0.5–1 μL) of dye was placed onto the surface of the dish and the animal was moved such that the intended cut-site on a single antenna or maxillary palp was placed in the drop of dye. The antenna or maxillary palp was then removed with sharp forceps and a fine scalpel (F.S.T 10315-12) while it was submerged in the dye. Care was taken to remove the maxillary palp proximal to the fourth segment, to include all the capitate-peg sensilla, and to remove the antenna near the base but to leave the antennal pedicel completely intact. The animal remained immobile on ice with the antenna or maxillary palp submerged and the dye was loaded for 2–5 min. After this time the animal was placed in a small soup cup with access to 10% sucrose and returned to standard rearing conditions overnight to give the dye time to diffuse throughout the neurons and fill the length of the axon. The next morning dissection of adult brains and immunofluorescence was carried out as described above.
In an attempt to develop a map of the Ae. aegypti antennal lobe, 3 brains from the +/+ LVP strain were immunolabeled with Brp to identify the boundaries between antennal lobe glomeruli. The left antennal lobe in each brain was independently reconstructed from confocal sections taken with a Plan-Apochromat 63x/1.40NA oil immersion objective, at 1024× 1024 pixel resolution in X and Y with 0.5 μm Z-steps for a final voxel size of either 0.1318 × 0.1318 × 0.5 μm 3 using the software Imaris (Bitplane). Although the area previously termed Johnston’s organ center was considered a single glomerulus in a previous study ( Ignell et al., 2005 46. Ignell, R. ∙ Dekker, T. ∙ Ghaninia, M. ... Neuronal architecture of the mosquito deutocerebrum J. Comp. Neurol. 2005; 493 :207-240 Crossref Scopus (104) PubMed Google Scholar ), we noted anatomical boundaries in this region, suggesting that it contains multiple glomeruli. This observation is consistent with recently published work ( Shankar and McMeniman, 2020 100. Shankar, S. ∙ McMeniman, C.J. An updated antennal lobe atlas for the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2020; 14 :e0008729 Crossref Scopus (4) PubMed Google Scholar ) and this area was segmented by an individual researcher to generate the final reconstructions. Two of these are shown in Figure S1 . Each glomerulus was manually segmented into an individual surface using Surpass View. We were consistently able to identify the three glomeruli innervated by the maxillary palp, previously termed MD1, MD2 and MD3 ( Ignell et al., 2005 46. Ignell, R. ∙ Dekker, T. ∙ Ghaninia, M. ... Neuronal architecture of the mosquito deutocerebrum J. Comp. Neurol. 2005; 493 :207-240 Crossref Scopus (104) PubMed Google Scholar ) which we refer to in this study as Glomerulus 1, Glomerulus 2, and Glomerulus 3 ( Figures 1 and 5 ). The overall structure of the antennal lobe varied considerably from animal to animal and although we were able to identify certain regions and certain landmark glomeruli including those that are targeted by the maxillary palp, we were unable to assign an unambiguous identity to every glomerulus, as is possible in D. melanogaster ( Couto et al., 2005 23. Couto, A. ∙ Alenius, M. ∙ Dickson, B.J. Molecular, anatomical, and functional organization of the Drosophila olfactory system Curr. Biol. 2005; 15 :1535-1547 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (656) PubMed Google Scholar ; Fishilevich and Vosshall, 2005 31. Fishilevich, E. ∙ Vosshall, L.B. Genetic and functional subdivision of the Drosophila antennal lobe Curr. Biol. 2005; 15 :1548-1553 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (429) PubMed Google Scholar ). This variability makes it essentially impossible to identify a given glomerulus between animals and we therefore have decided to avoid referring to glomeruli by previous naming schemes, including MD1, MD2, MD3. An authoritative atlas of the Ae. aegypti antennal lobe awaits genetic reagents that label subpopulations of sensory neurons that will permit the field to refer to glomeruli by their molecular identity.
Whole-mount immunofluorescence of adult antennae was performed as described ( Riabinina et al., 2016 87. Riabinina, O. ∙ Task, D. ∙ Marr, E. ... Organization of olfactory centres in the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 :13010 Crossref Scopus (77) PubMed Google Scholar ) with modifications. 7-11-day-old Liverpool mosquitoes were immobilized on ice, decapitated and heads and placed in 1 mL ZnFA fixative solution (0.25% ZnCl 2 , 2% paraformaldehyde, 135 mM NaCl, 1.2% sucrose and 0.03% Triton X-100) for 20–24 h at room temperature in the dark. Next, the heads were washed three times for 30 min each with HBS buffer (150 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 25 mM sucrose, 10 mM HEPES, 5 mM CaCl 2 and 0.03% Triton X-100). Antennae were carefully removed in HBS on ice and placed in 400 μL HBS in 0.5 mL Eppendorf tubes. After a brief wash in HBS, the tissue was incubated in 400 μL 80% methanol/20% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solution for 1 h at room temperature, washed for 5 min in 400 μL 0.1 M Tris pH 7.4, 0.03% Triton X-100 solution and incubated in 400 μL blocking solution (PBS, 5% normal goat serum (Jackson 005-000-121), 1% DMSO and 0.3% Triton X-100) for at least 3 h at room temperature or overnight at 4°C. Next, the tissue was placed in a 0.5 mL Eppendorf tubes containing 400 μL blocking solution with primary antibodies [rabbit anti-Orco EC2 ( Larsson et al., 2004 59.

Next, the tubes were placed on a rotator for 2 days at 4°C in the dark, after which the sonication procedure was repeated. The tubes were placed on a rotator for 2 additional days (for a total of 4 days) at 4°C in the dark. Next, the tissue was washed 5 × 30 min each at room temperature in PBS, 1% DMSO and 0.3% Triton X-100. Secondary antibodies (anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 555 Plus, 1:200, Thermo Fisher A-32732, anti-chicken Alexa Fluor 488, 1:200, Thermo Fisher A-11039) and nuclear dye (TO-PRO-3 Iodide, 1:400, Thermo Fisher T3605) were added to the blocking solution, and tubes were sonicated as described above and incubated for 4 days at 4°C in the dark with the sonication repeated after 2 days of incubation. The tissue was then washed 5 × 30 min at room temperature in PBS, 1% DMSO and 0.3% Triton X-100, rinsed in PBS and mounted in Slow Fade Diamond for confocal imaging.
This protocol was performed as previously described ( Basrur et al., 2020 5. Basrur, N.S. ∙ De Obaldia, M.E. ∙ Morita, T. ... Fruitless mutant male mosquitoes gain attraction to human odor Elife. 2020; 9 :e63982 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) with modifications. Six-to 11-day-old female mosquitoes were anesthetized on wet ice, decapitated, and placed in 1.5 mL 5 U/mL chitinase (Sigma C6137) and 100 U/mL chymotrypsin (Sigma CHY5S) in 119 mM NaCl, 48 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 2 mM MgCl2, 25 mM HEPES, 1% DMSO buffer on ice. Heads were incubated on a ThermoMixer (Eppendorf 5,382,000,023) at 37 °C for 5 min, followed by 55 min in a rotating hybridization oven at 37 °C. Heads were then rinsed once and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, 1X Ca+2, Mg+2 free PBS, and 0.03% Triton X-100 for 24 h at 4 °C on a rotator. All subsequent 4 °C steps used a nutator, and room temperature steps used a rotator. Heads were washed for 30 min at room temperature at least three times in 1X PBS with 0.03% Triton X-100 (0.03% PBT). Antennae were then dissected into 0.5-mL microfuge tubes and dehydrated in 80% methanol/20% DMSO for 1 h at room temperature. Antennae were washed in 0.03% PBT for 30 min at room temperature, and blocked/permeabilized in 1X PBS, 1% DMSO (Sigma 472,301), 5% normal goat serum, 4% Triton X-100 for 24 h at 4 °C. Antennae were washed for 30 min at least five times with 0.03% PBT, 1% DMSO, 5% normal goat serum at 4 °C, and then moved to primary antibody in 1X PBS, 1% DMSO, 5% normal goat serum, 0.03% Triton X-100 for 72 h at 4 °C. Primary antibodies used were mouse anti- Apocrypta bakeri Orco monoclonal antibody #15B2 (1:50 dilution, gift of Joel Butterwick and Vanessa Ruta), and rabbit anti-Ir25a (1:50 dilution). Orco monoclonal antibody and Ir25a polyclonal antibody specificities were verified in Ae. aegypti by staining orco mutant and Ir25a mutant antennae, respectively ( Figures 3 E–3H). Antennae were washed for 30 min at least five times with 0.03% PBT, 1% DMSO at room temperature, and then washed overnight in the same solution. Antennae were then moved to secondary antibody (1:200) in 1X PBS, 1% DMSO, 5% normal goat serum, 0.03% Triton X-100 for 72 h at 4 °C. Secondary antibodies used were goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 (Thermo A-11001) and goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 555 Plus (Thermo A32732). Antennae were washed for 30 min at least five times with 0.03% PBT, 1% DMSO at room temperature, and then washed overnight in the same solution. Antennae were rinsed in 1X PBS, rinsed three times in Slowfade Diamond (Thermo S36972), and mounted in Slowfade Diamond.
RNA was detected in whole mount antenna and maxillary palp using the hybridization chain reaction (HCR) technique as previously described ( Choi et al., 2018 18.

Probes, amplifiers, Probe Hybridization Buffer, Amplification Buffer, and Probe Wash Buffer were purchased from Molecular Instruments. Full list of probe lot numbers can be found in Data S1 . 5-8 day-old Liverpool mosquitoes were anesthetized on wet ice, manually decapitated with forceps, and heads with antennae and the proboscis were digested in a chitinase-chymotrypsin solution (119 mM NaCl, 48 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl 2 , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 25 mM HEPES, 5 U/mL chitinase (Sigma-Aldrich C6137-50UN), 100 U/mL alpha-chymotrypsin (Sigma-Aldrich CHY5S-10VL), 2% DMSO) ( Manning and Doe, 2017 65. Manning, L. ∙ Doe, C.Q. Immunofluorescent antibody staining of intact Drosophila larvae Nat. Protoc. 2017; 12 :1-14 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ) at 37°C for 30 min (antennae) or 1 h (maxillary palps) in a Fisher Isotemp oven and subsequently fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, 1X PBS, 0.03% Triton X-100 on a rotator at 4°C overnight. Heads were washed 4 times on ice for 10 min each in 0.1% PBS-Tween-20. Antennae or maxillary palps were dissected in 0.1% PBS-Tween-20 on ice and dehydrated with a graded series of methanol/0.1% PBS-Tween: 25% methanol in 0.1% PBS-Tween-20 for 10 min on ice, 50% methanol in 0.1% PBS-Tween-20 for 10 min on ice, 75% methanol in 0.1% PBS-Tween-20 for 10 min on ice, and two washes of 100% methanol for 10 min on ice. Tissues were incubated overnight in 100% methanol at −20°C and were subsequently rehydrated with a series of graded methanol/0.1% PBS-Tween-20: 75% methanol in 0.1% PBS-Tween-20 for 10 min on ice, 50% methanol in 0.1% PBS-Tween-20 for 10 min on ice, 25% methanol in 0.1% PBS-Tween-20 for 10 min on ice, and two washes of 0.1% PBS-Tween-20 for 10 min each on ice. Tissue was digested in 20 μg/mL Proteinase K (Thermo Fisher AM2548) in 0.1% PBS-Tween for 30 min at room temperature and washed twice with 0.1% PBS-Tween-20 for 10 min each at room temperature. Tissue was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1% PBS-Tween-20 for 20 min at room temperature and washed 3 times for 10 min each in 0.1% PBS-Tween-20 at room temperature. Tissue was incubated in Probe Hybridization Buffer at room temperature for 5 min and then in 37°C pre-warmed Probe Hybridization Buffer rotating in a hybridization oven for 30 min 8 pmol of each probe set was prepared in 37°C pre-warmed Probe Hybridization Buffer and tissue was incubated in probe solution at 37°C in a hybridization oven for 2 nights. Tissues were washed in 37°C pre-warmed Probe Wash Buffer 5 times for 10 min each at 37°C. Tissues were washed twice in 5X SSC 0.1% Tween 20 at room temperature for 10 min each. Tissues were pre-amplified in room temperature Amplification Buffer for 10 min 18 pmol hairpins were separately prepared by heating 6 μL of 3 μM stock of hairpins H1 and H2 at 95°C for 90 s on an Eppendorf Mastercycler and allowing to cool to room temperature in a dark drawer for 30 min. Hairpins were resuspended in 100 μL amplification buffer and tissues were incubated in this hairpin solution in the dark on a rotator at room temperature overnight. Tissues were washed 5 times for 10 min each in 5X SSC 0.1% Tween 20 and mounted in SlowFade Diamond (Thermo Fisher S36972) on glass slides with coverslips for confocal imaging.
7-14-day-old Ir25a-QF2 , Orco-QF2 , Ir25a-QF2AD , Orco-QFDBD , and Ir25a-QF2AD Orco-QFDBD>15XQUAS-dTomato-T2A-GCaMP6s mosquitoes were anesthetized on wet ice, manually decapitated with forceps and heads with antennae, proboscises, and maxillary palps were immediately fixed in 1 mL 4% paraformaldehyde, 1X PBS, 0.03% Triton X-100, on a rotator in the dark at 4°C overnight. Heads were washed 3 × 30 min each in 1X PBS, 0.03% Triton X-100 at room temperature, then antennae, proboscises, and maxillary palps were carefully removed and placed in 1X PBS, 0.03% Triton X-100. Next, antennae, proboscises, and maxillary palps were placed in a solution of 1X PBS, 0.03% Triton X-100, 1% DMSO, and a 1:400 dilution of TO-PRO-3 (Thermo Fisher T3605) for 24 h at 4°C in the dark. Antennae, proboscises, and maxillary palps were then washed 5 × 30 min each in 1X PBS, 0.03% Triton X-100 at room temperature in the dark, washed once with 1X PBS, transferred to a well of SlowFade diamond to remove excess PBS, and mounted in SlowFade Diamond for confocal imaging.
Images of peripheral tissues were acquired with a Zeiss Axio Observer Z1 Inverted LSM 880 NLO laser scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss) with a 25x/0.8 NA or 63x/1.4 NA immersion-corrected objective at a resolution of 3096× 3096 pixels or 2048 x 2048 pixels. When comparing dTomato fluorescence across genotypes, image acquisition parameters were kept consistent. When necessary, tiled images were stitched with 20% overlap. We note that all confocal imaging was conducted in a manner that would maximize our ability to visualize the presence or absence of each fluorophore and was not intended as a quantitative measure of fluorescence intensity. Confocal images were processed in ImageJ (NIH). Because the antenna is a cylindrical structure, when whole antennal segments are mounted on a slide and imaged on a confocal microscope, signal can be easily detected from the region closest to the coverslip and confocal objective, but signal is weaker when imaging the side further from the coverslip and objective. For the purposes of consistent quantification, we only quantified cell numbers from the region closest to the coverslip (red rectangle in Figure S3 E). For quantifying expression in the maxillary palp, only the dorso-lateral region of the fourth maxillary palp segment was analyzed. (yellow rectangle in Figure S3 F). Quantification of co-expression in antennae and maxillary palps was done in ImageJ (NIH) using the Cell Counter plugin. Cells in each channel were manually marked independently of the signal in the other channels. After cells in each channel are marked, and markers were then merged. Cells that were labeled with multiple markers (co-expressing cells) were then marked with a third marker ( Figures S3 G–S3L). Cell counts were then imported into Microsoft Excel and R for analysis.
Approximately 100–250 female +/+ LVP mosquitoes aged 6–8 days post-eclosion were anesthetized on wet ice for 10 min. Mosquitoes were then placed in a 70 μm cell strainer (Falcon 08-771-1). The cell strainer containing the anesthetized mosquitoes was placed in a 60 mm Petri dish (Corning 430,166), and ice-cold molecular-grade 100% ethanol was gently poured into the cell strainer for 5 s. The cell strainer with ethanol-rinsed mosquitoes was then transferred to a new 60 mm Petri dish and ice-cold Schneider’s Medium (Gibco 21,720,024) was poured into the cell strainer to rinse. Approximately 20 mL of ice-cold Schneider’s medium was poured into a 100 mm Petri dish (Corning 430,293) on wet ice or reusable ice pack (Cooler Shock, mid-size freeze pack). Schneider’s Medium-rinsed mosquitoes were transferred from the cell strainer to the 100 mm Petri dish. A new 70 μm cell strainer (pluriSelect 43–10070) with walls trimmed with a sterile razor blade to a height of 0.5–0.75 cm was placed into the same 100 mm Petri dish. The antennae were then removed using forceps and placed into the cell strainer. Antennae were rinsed approximately every 10 min by agitating the cell strainer and pipetting fresh ice-cold Schneider’s Medium into the cell strainer. Dissection of each sample was limited to 90 min to ensure nuclei integrity, and when 90 min elapsed or all mosquitoes dissected, antennae were transferred into a DNA LoBind 1.5 mL tube (Eppendorf 022,431,021) pre-wet with Schneider’s Medium. The cell strainer with antennae was inverted with forceps into the tube and approximately 300 μL ice-cold Schneider’s Medium was pipetted into the cell strainer to release antennae into the Eppendorf tube. The sample was then flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70°C until ready for nuclei extraction. A total of approximately 750-1300 antennae were collected for each snRNA-seq batch, collected across four 90-min dissection sessions. Two batches of female antennae were processed for the snRNA-seq data presented in this paper. All tissue was collected at Rockefeller University. Batch 1 was processed at Rockefeller University (including nuclei extraction, 10X Genomics run, library preparation and sequencing), and Batch 2 was shipped on dry ice and processed at Baylor College of Medicine.
Nuclei extraction of mosquito antennae was performed as previously described ( McLaughlin et al., 2021 73. McLaughlin, C.N. ∙ Brbić, M. ∙ Xie, Q. ... Single-cell transcriptomes of developing and adult olfactory receptor neurons in Drosophila Elife. 2021; 10 :e63856 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) with modifications. Dissected antennae were thawed on wet ice, and all subsequent steps were performed on wet ice unless otherwise noted. Once samples were thawed, antennae were centrifuged in a benchtop microcentrifuge for 5–10 s, Schneider’s Medium was removed and replaced with 100 μL of homogenization buffer ( McLaughlin et al., 2021 73. McLaughlin, C.N. ∙ Brbić, M. ∙ Xie, Q. ... Single-cell transcriptomes of developing and adult olfactory receptor neurons in Drosophila Elife. 2021; 10 :e63856 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Antennae from multiple dissection sessions were combined into a single DNA LoBind 1.5 mL tube using a low-retention repel polymer technology 200 μL filter tip (TipOne 11,821,830), with ∼1 mm from the distal end trimmed using a sterilized and RNAse away-treated (Thermo Fisher 7000TS1) razor blade. With no more than 500 μL buffer present in the tube, tissue was ground for 30–60 s with a pellet pestle motor (Kimble 749,540-0000) and RNase-free pestle (Kimble 749,521-0590). The volume of buffer was brought up to 1000 μL with additional ice-cold homogenization buffer. Next, a 1 mL Dounce tissue grinder and pestle set (Wheaton 357,538) that had been autoclaved at 121°C for 4 h the previous day was pre-wetted with homogenization buffer. Using a low-retention (repel polymer technology) 1000 μL filter tip (TipOne 11,821,830), samples were transferred into the Dounce homogenizer. Nuclei were released by homogenizing with 20 strokes of the loose pestle, and 40 strokes of the tight pestle. Next, a low-retention 1000 μL tip was used to remove ∼500 μL of the suspension. The suspension was filtered through a 40 μm Flowmi filter (Bel-Art H13680-0040) into a pre-wet 20 μm PluriStrainer (pluriSelect 43-10020-40) in a 1.5 mL LoBind Eppendorf tube. The second ∼500 μL antennae nuclei suspension was then filtered the same way into the same Eppendorf tube. The suspension was then divided equally into two 1.5 mL LoBind Eppendorf tubes and centrifuged for 10 min at 500xG at 4°C. The supernatant was gently discarded without disturbing the pellet. Next, pellets were resuspended in 100 μL 1X PBS, 1% BSA, 10 μL/mL RNAse inhibitor (Roche RNAINH-RO) by pipetting 5 times with a low-retention 1000 μL tip, combined and pipetted to re-suspend and break up cell clumps 15 more times. The suspension was then filtered three times by running it through a Flowmi filter into a 10 μm strainer (pluriSelect 43-10010-40) in a 1.5 mL LoBind Eppendorf tube. To ensure nuclei were not clumping, 10 μL of the suspension was removed and stained with acridine orange and propidium iodide (Logos Biosystems, LGBD10012). The concentration of nuclei was determined by counting cells on a Luna FX7 automated cell counter (Logos Biosystems L70001).
Single cell 3' expression Libraries were generated using Chromium Single Cell 3′ Library & Gel Bead kit Version 3.1 (10X Genomics PN1000269). Standard protocols from 10X Genomics were followed to generate the dual index libraries. Due to the small nucleus size (4–5 μm in diameter), 17 cycles were used for cDNA amplification and 13 cycles for index PCR. The quality and quantity of the libraries were assessed on Agilent TapeStation, the library was sequenced on Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencer using 100 cycle SP flowcell and 800 million paired reads were generated (read 1 = 28 bp, read 2 = 90 bp).
Nuclei extraction from mosquito antennae were performed as previously described ( Li et al., 2022 60. Li, H. ∙ Janssens, J. ∙ De Waegeneer, M. ... Fly Cell Atlas: a single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the adult fruit fly Science. 2022; 375 :eabk2432 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ) with modifications. Fresh homogenization buffer ( Li et al., 2022 60. Li, H. ∙ Janssens, J. ∙ De Waegeneer, M. ... Fly Cell Atlas: a single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the adult fruit fly Science. 2022; 375 :eabk2432 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ) was prepared and kept on ice. Samples were thawed from −80°C on wet ice, spun down in 100 μL Schneider’s Medium using a bench top spinner, and as much medium as possible was discarded. Antennae from multiple dissection sessions were combined into a single 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube using a low-retention 200 μL filter tip (Rainin 30,389,240) with ∼1 mm from the distal end trimmed using a sterilized and RNAse away-treated (Thermo Fisher 7000TS1) razor blade (VWR 10835-965) and 100 μL Homogenization buffer was added. The sample was ground with a pestle motor (Kimble 6HAZ6) for 30–60 s on wet ice. 900 μL homogenization buffer was added, and 1000 μL homogenized sample was transferred into the 1 mL Dounce tissue grinder set (Wheaton 357,538) that had been autoclaved at 200°C for >5 h or overnight a day in advance. Nuclei were released by 20 strokes with a loose Dounce pestle and 40 with a tight Dounce pestle on ice, taking care to avoid bubbles. 1000 μL of the sample was filtered through a 5 mL cell strainer (35 μm), and then filtered using 40 μm Flowmi (BelArt, H13680-0040) into 1.5 mL EP tube, centrifuged for 10 min at 1000xG at 4°C. The supernatant was discarded with care not to disturb the pellet. The nuclei were resuspended using 500 μL 1xPBS/0.5%BSA with RNase inhibitor (9.5 mL 1x PBS, 0.5 mL 10% BSA, 50 μL RNasin Plusby) pipetting at least 20 times to completely re-suspend the nuclei. Sample were filtered using 40 μm Flowmi into a new 5 mL fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) tube and kept on wet ice.
FACS sorting was done using a BD FACSAria III Cell Sorter to collect nuclei (for FACS plots and gates, see Data S1 ). Nuclei were stained with Hoechst-33342 (1:1000; >5 min). Hoechst-positive nuclei were collected into 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube with 500 μL 1x PBS with 0.5% BSA as the receiving buffer (RNase inhibitor added). For each 10X Genomics run, all nuclei were collected. Approximately 15,000 nuclei were collected from the antennae. Nuclei were spun for 10 min at 1000XG at 4°C, and then resuspended using 43.2 μL 1x PBS with 0.5% BSA (RNase inhibitor added). Since the yield of nuclei was low, all nuclei were loaded onto a 10X Genomics controller. 10X Genomics sequencing libraries were prepared following the standard protocol from 10X Genomics 3′ v3.1 kit with following settings. All PCR reactions were performed using the Biorad C1000 Touch Thermal cycler with 96-Deep Well Reaction Module. 13 cycles were used for cDNA amplification and 16 cycles were used for sample index PCR. As per 10X Genomics protocol, 1:10 dilutions of amplified cDNA and final libraries were evaluated on Agilent 4200 TapeStation. Single-cell RNA libraries were sequenced on Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencer with minimum sequencing depth of 50,000 reads/cell using the read lengths 28bp Read1, 8bp i7 Index, 91bp Read2.
Maxillary palp dissections were conducted as described for the antenna. A total of 2,448 total maxillary palps were collected across fifteen 90-min dissection sessions at Rockefeller. These samples were shipped on dry ice and processed at Baylor College of Medicine. Nuclei extraction and FACS was performed at Baylor as described for the Batch 2 antenna sample with approximately 7,000 nuclei collected (for FACS plots and gates, see Data S1 ). 10X Genomics, library preparation, and sequencing was done as described above for the Batch 2 antenna sample.
Alignment and initial cell identification: The Ae. aegypti genome (AaegL5.0, GCF_002204515.2 on NCBI) was indexed using Cell Ranger (version 6.0.2). FASTQ files generated from 10X Genomics 3′ gene expression libraries were mapped to the indexed genomes and gene counts in each cell were calculated by CellRanger (version 6.0.2). Intron signals were included by specifying the --include-introns parameter for cellranger count. From this point onward, data were further processed and analyzed using R and RStudio ( R Core Team, 2021 84. R Core Team R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing R Foundation for Statistical Computing, 2021 https://www.R-project.org/ Google Scholar ; R Studio Team, 2020 92. R Studio Team Integrated Development for R 2020 R Studio http://www.rstudio.com/ Google Scholar ).
Ambient RNA removal: DecontX from the Celda package ( antenna: version 1.10.1, maxillary palp: 1.8.1) ( Wang et al., 2021 120. Wang, Z. ∙ Yang, S. ∙ Koga, Y. ... Celda: A Bayesian model to perform co-clustering of genes into modules and cells into subpopulations using single-cell RNA-seq data bioRxiv. 2021; 2020 :11-16 373274 Google Scholar ) was chosen for removing the ambient RNAs produced during nuclei preparation. Raw and filtered reads generated from Cell Ranger were compared by DecontX to obtain decontaminated reads ( Figures S5 A and S7 A). The decontaminated reads were rounded by the R base:round function and the decontaminated matrices were generated by the DropletUtils package (version 1.14.2) ( Griffiths et al., 2018 42. Griffiths, J.A. ∙ Richard, A.C. ∙ Bach, K. ... Detection and removal of barcode swapping in single-cell RNA-seq data Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :2667 Crossref Scopus (91) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Decontaminated expression matrices were loaded into the Seurat package (antenna: version 4.1.0, maxillary palp: 4.0.5) ( Satija et al., 2015 93. Satija, R. ∙ Farrell, J.A. ∙ Gennert, D. ... Spatial reconstruction of single-cell gene expression data Nat. Biotechnol. 2015; 33 :495-502 Crossref Scopus (1857) PubMed Google Scholar ), filtering for cells with a minimum total features of 200 and genes expressed in a minimum of 3 cells for the maxillary palp, and 12 cells for the antenna (determined by evaluation of the distribution of cells per feature). Multiplets were identified by DoubletFinder (version 2.0.3) ( McGinnis et al., 2019 70. McGinnis, C.S. ∙ Murrow, L.M. ∙ Gartner, Z.J. DoubletFinder: Doublet Detection in Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Data Using Artificial Nearest Neighbors Cell Syst. 2019; 8 :329-337.e4 e324 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (416) PubMed Google Scholar ). The pK with maximum AUC was chosen for DoubletFinder. The multiplet numbers were estimated by the multiplet rate table on the 10X Genomics website. DoubletFinder-defined multiplets were excluded for the downstream analysis.
Cell filtering (antenna): Cells expressing a total number of features within the lowest 3% of each batch were excluded. As a further precaution against the inclusion of potential multiplets, we only included cells with the number of detective genes less than the median of gene number plus 3 median absolute deviations (MADs) for the analysis. Cells with more than 5% of mitochondrial transcripts were excluded ( Figures S5 C–S5E).
Cell filtering (maxillary palp): Cells with extreme gene numbers or abundant mitochondria transcripts were removed using Seurat ( Satija et al., 2015 93. Satija, R. ∙ Farrell, J.A. ∙ Gennert, D. ... Spatial reconstruction of single-cell gene expression data Nat. Biotechnol. 2015; 33 :495-502 Crossref Scopus (1857) PubMed Google Scholar ). We excluded nuclei expressing fewer than 400 or greater than 4000 genes. Nuclei with more than 5% of mitochondrial transcripts were excluded. Genes expressed in fewer than 3 nuclei were removed ( Figures S7 B–S7D).
Normalization and dimensionality reduction (maxillary palp): Expression matrices of remaining nuclei were loaded into the Seurat package and processed by Seurat (version 4.0.5) ( Satija et al., 2015 93. Satija, R. ∙ Farrell, J.A. ∙ Gennert, D. ... Spatial reconstruction of single-cell gene expression data Nat. Biotechnol. 2015; 33 :495-502 Crossref Scopus (1857) PubMed Google Scholar ). The analyses applied default parameters of Seurat unless specified. Expression matrices were normalized using NormalizeData() function. Highly variable genes were selected using FindVariableFeatures(). The data were scaled using the ScaleData() function with the vars.to.regress = c('nCount_RNA′) parameter to regress out the effect of the total counts. The scaled data were dimensionally reduced using the RunPCA() function. t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) was used for visualizing the non-linear dimensionality reduction with 1–50 dimensions. Nuclei were clustered using the Louvain algorithm ( Figure 6 C).
Normalization, dimensionality reduction, merging and batch correction (antenna): With little previous explicit research on the detailed composition of the mosquito antenna and few known gene markers for mosquito cell types, analysis pipeline decisions on the remaining cells were weighed holistically by the following criteria: (1) interrogating the data for possible technical artifacts, and (2) how well putative chemosensory cell types separated, here defined as a group of cells expressing the same chemosensory receptor gene or combination of receptor genes. Future research into cell populations in the antenna may uncover information on which to further “ground-truth” and refine this analysis pipeline.
Initially, we applied either LogNormalize() and SCTransform() to normalization our data for analysis. Log-normalized data appeared hampered significantly with low UMI gene counts frequently resulting in high normalization scores (data not shown). Additionally, our batches were sequenced at different depths, a technical factor which sctransform is designed to address ( Hafemeister and Satija, 2019 44. Hafemeister, C. ∙ Satija, R. Normalization and variance stabilization of single-cell RNA-seq data using regularized negative binomial regression Genome Biol. 2019; 20 :296 Crossref Scopus (742) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, we applied sctransform for normalization, scaling, and identification of highly variable genes for downstream analysis. Sctransfrom-normalized data were dimensionally reduced using the RunPCA() function. t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) was used for visualizing the non-linear dimensionality reduction with 1–50 dimensions. Nuclei were clustered using the Louvain algorithm ( Figures S5 G and 6 C).
We performed two independent snRNA-seq experiments on the antenna to collect a greater number of nuclei for our analysis. After filtering, the two batches were merged and renormalized. To correct principal component analysis (PCA) embeddings and remove the batch effects, we performed either harmony (version 0.1.0) ( Korsunsky et al., 2019 55. Korsunsky, I. ∙ Millard, N. ∙ Fan, J. ... Fast, sensitive and accurate integration of single-cell data with Harmony Nat. Methods. 2019; 16 :1289-1296 Crossref Scopus (806) PubMed Google Scholar ) or canonical correlation analysis (CCA) implemented in Seurat ( Satija et al., 2015 93. Satija, R. ∙ Farrell, J.A. ∙ Gennert, D. ... Spatial reconstruction of single-cell gene expression data Nat. Biotechnol. 2015; 33 :495-502 Crossref Scopus (1857) PubMed Google Scholar ), also comparing the resulting clusters to the uncorrected data population (data not shown). The two batches of antenna snRNA-seq data were combined using merge(). For CCA-based integration, batches were split using and SplitObject() functions in Seurat. Split objects were normalized and selected for highly variable genes independently. 3,000 features used for the integration were selected by the SelectIntegrationFeatures() and PrepSCTIntegration() functions in Seurat. Two batches were then integrated using the FindIntegrationAnchors() and IntegrateData() functions. For harmony-based correction, batch-corrected dimensions were obtained using the RunHarmony() function. Batch-corrected samples using both methods were then analyzed following the procedures described in the previous section from scaling to clustering to identify cluster-specific genes. Harmony was selected as the batch-correction the final dataset and the generation of the final figures in this paper. Any subsequent clustering was done on Harmony-corrected PCs.
Neuron cluster identification: Cells were dimensionally reduced as described above and with a clustering resolution of 1. To classify cells as neurons, we first identified genes that are orthologous to the neuronal marker genes used in D. melanogaster using BLASTP. Four mosquito genes, LOC5565901, LOC5570204, LOC5564848, and LOC5570381, are orthologous to the D. melanogaster neural markers, synaptotagmin 1 ( syt1 ), embryonic lethal abnormal vision ( elav ), cadherin-N ( CadN ), and bruchpilot ( brp ), respectively. We saw that expression largely overlapped with the OSN co-receptors Orco , Ir25a , Ir76b , and Ir8a , consistent with the idea that these are neuronal markers. We defined neural clusters based on the expression of syt1 , elav , CadN , and brp , and clusters expressing at least three neuronal markers in more than 50% of cells in the corresponding cluster were defined as neural clusters ( Figures S5 I, S7F, and S7G). The remaining cells were reprocessed using RunUMAP(), RunTSNE(), FindNeighbors() and FindClusters().
Neuron cluster identification (antenna): Before dimensionality reduction of the final neuron population, clusters 3 and 45 were also removed because in some iterations of the pipeline the central neural cluster they did not meet our criteria for classification as “neurons”. In addition to low expression of neural markers and variable quality control metrics, it was ambiguous whether these were legitimate neural clusters ( Figures S5 G–S5I). For more data on clusters 3 and 45, see Data S1 .
Cluster resolution testing (antenna neurons): FindClusters() was tested using the following resolutions: 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, 1.5, 1.7, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.2, 3.5, 3.7, 4.0. Between each resolution, cells were assessed for chemoreceptor expression changes in cluster assignment. Cluster separations were evaluated for “validity” using heatmaps for chemosensory receptor gene expression – essentially whether a cluster separation identified populations with distinct expression of chemosensory genes. For instance, cluster 3 at resolution 3.7 split at resolution 4.0 into cluster 40, primarily Or44 -expressing cells and cluster 6, primarily non- Or44 expressing cells in cluster 6. Some mutually exclusive receptors could not be separated by high clustering resolution, such as asterisk-marked clusters in Figure 4 D, in addition to Figures S5 L and S5M), indicating that sometimes cluster categorization was driven by general transcriptome characteristics and not solely by chemoreceptor expression. Bulked over the neuron population, 185 chemoreceptor genes had SCT-corrected UMI counts of 2 or above ( Figure S5 F; full plot in Data S1 ). 121 were identified as highly variable genes by sctransform when normalized after batch merging. If the remaining 64 chemoreceptors were appended to the highly variable gene list, and principal components re-run, it did not a noticeable difference for cluster identities (data not shown).
Expression criteria (antenna): Neural clusters were then examined for ligand-selective receptor and co-receptor expression. For ligand-selective receptors, we define “expression” of a gene within a cell as being expressed above a sctransform normalized expression value of 1 ( Figure S6 A). Because sctransform performs via adjusting UMI values, this also corresponds to an adjusted UMI value of 2 or above. We define “co-expression” as genes that meet this criteria in 10 or more cells within our identified neuron population. The chord plots compare the sctransform-adjusted UMIs ( Figure 4 E) and non-adjusted UMIs ( Figure S5 J), with the same but fewer chords appearing in the sctransform chord plot.
Co-receptors Ir25a , Ir76b , Ir8a have similar overall expression levels in the tissue with other highly expressed ligand-selective receptors, so we applied the same criteria for these co-receptors ( Figures S5 F and S6 ). Orco , conversely, is expressed overall at an order of magnitude higher than other chemoreceptors, likely why it leads to the contamination of other cells, including non-neurons ( Figure S5 A). Therefore, for Orco we raised the definition of “expression” to a normalized expression value of 2, corresponding to an sctransform-adjusted UMI value of 6.
Determination of minimum number of chemosensory cell types in antenna: Within our chemosensory neuron population, we define “cell type” as a population of neurons expressing the same chemosensory receptors. By examining cluster chemoreceptor expression, we determined that there are at least 35 chemosensory cell types in the antenna. Clusters with high levels of LOC5575210, a gene orthologous to D. melanogaster gene no mechanoreceptor potential C ( nompC ), were excluded. High cluster resolution was needed to separate some clusters containing mutually exclusive chemoreceptor expression (see cluster resolution testing above). However sometimes cells with the same chemoreceptor expression were also separated by clustering, resulting in “duplicate” clusters, although there may be differences in expression of these clusters for expression of other genes (clusters 4 and 22, clusters 13 and 18, clusters 12 and 41, cluster 9 and 5). Cluster 26 has no apparent ligand-specific chemoreceptor expression ( Figure 4 D and S6 A). We arrived at the total number of cell types according to this scheme: (42 total clusters) - (2 clusters with nompC ) - (1 cluster with no apparent ligand-specific chemoreceptor expression) - (4 “duplicate” clusters) = 35 chemosensory cell types. Figure S6 A also illustrates these chemoreceptor expression-defined cell types. 35 is a conservative estimate of chemoreceptor cell types since there are instances of multiple populations of chemosensory cell types co-clusters such as the ligand-specific IR cells in cluster 0 ( Figures S5 L and S5M). In addition, transcript “drop outs” make it difficult to determine if cells within a cluster that have low or sparse expression of a given gene mean that there are additional heterogeneity along distinct subtypes of these lower expressed chemoreceptors, or this is a result of sampling limitation of snRNAseq. Based on this, we believe that there are more than 35 cell types.
Antenna cell marker heatmap (on total cell population): The heatmap in Figure 4 B was generated using normalized expression values and the ComplexHeatmap package in R ( R Core Team, 2021 84. R Core Team R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing R Foundation for Statistical Computing, 2021 https://www.R-project.org/ Google Scholar ). Epithelia-, glia-, and neuron-enriched genes in the D. melanogaster antenna were considered as references of the corresponding marker genes in Ae. aegypti . Mosquito genes LOC5564305, LOC5570152, LOC5576812 were used as markers for epithelia cell clusters and are orthologolous respectively to D. melanogaster genes grainy head ( grh ), farkas ( far ), pyrokinin 1 receptor ( pk1-r ). Mosquito genes LOC110678282, LOC110678282, LOC110676862, were used as markers for putative glial cell clusters and are orthologus respectively for reversed polarity ( repo , LOC110678282), viking ( vkg , LOC110678282), aristaless ( al , LOC110676862), were used for glial cell clusters. Neural cell markers syt1 , elav , CadN , and brp , were used as listed above with the addition of LOC5567355, an orthologue to paralytic ( para ).
Antenna tSNE plot: To generate tSNE plots in Figure S5 G of all antennal nuclei and Figure 4 C of antennal neurons, expression matrices were first normalized, selected for highly variable genes, and scaled using sctransform. Scaled data were applied to the RunTSNE() with 1–50 dimensions. All antenna nuclei and antennal neurons were clustered using the Louvain algorithm with resolutions 1 and 4 respectively.
Antenna dot plot: The dot plot of cluster-enriched chemosensory receptors in Figure 4 D was based on the DotPlot() function in Seurat ( Satija et al., 2015 93. Satija, R. ∙ Farrell, J.A. ∙ Gennert, D. ... Spatial reconstruction of single-cell gene expression data Nat. Biotechnol. 2015; 33 :495-502 Crossref Scopus (1857) PubMed Google Scholar ) and customized using the ggplot2 package ( Wickham, 2016 123. Wickham, H. ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis Springer-Verlag, 2016 https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org Crossref Google Scholar ). The scaled mean normalized expression and expression percentage of each chemosensory receptor was calculated by the DotPlot() function. The hclust() function was used to cluster genes.
Asterisk-marked clusters: Co-clustering of different cell types within a cluster was marked to indicate that apparent co-expression of chemoreceptors within a cluster is not always indicative of co-expression within individual cells. Inversely a cluster with no apparent chemoreceptor expression may have some cells that express chemoreceptors at low levels. We determined that when cells that exhibited co-clustering but expressed different chemoreceptor cell types were mutually exclusive cell types according to cells’ highest expressed receptor within the cluster. For example see clusters 0 and 3 ( Figures S5 L and S5M). Co-clustering for asterisks-marked clusters can also be observed by looking at clusters in Figure S7 A. For cluster heatmaps, see Data S1 .
Triangle-marked clusters: Lower or more sparsely expressed chemoreceptors that are co-expressed on a cluster-level or when we looked at the scaled average expression but do not explicitly pass our stated threshold for co-expression are marked with a triangle. These also do not appear in the chord plot in Figure 4 E, which depicts only the co-expression relationships that clear our threshold. We used scaled average expression for the dot plot as a means of investigating expression of these chemoreceptors. For instance, Ir41m does not meet our co-expression with Ir41L . Ir41m ′s specific expression in cluster 38 appears high on a scaled ( Z score) of average expression because Ir41m has specific expression to cluster 38 (see Figures 4 F and S6 A). These genes provide important context for other highly expressed genes (e.g., that in cluster 38, Ir93a may not be expressed as a singular ligand-specific chemoreceptor, but co-expressed with other genes, potentially Ir21a ). For this reason, we did not omit these genes from the dot plot.
Antenna chord plot: The chord plot of co-expressed chemosensory receptor in Figures 4 E and S5 J was generated using the chorddiag package in R ( R Core Team, 2021 84. R Core Team R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing R Foundation for Statistical Computing, 2021 https://www.R-project.org/ Google Scholar ). A list of 184 receptor genes was generated from the matrix data and co-receptors Orco , Ir25a , Ir76b and Ir8a were excluded. Receptors that express UMI at 2 or above were considered as positively expressed. Each expressed chemosensory receptor was iteratively compared to the expression of the remaining chemosensory receptors in the corresponding nuclei. If more than 10 nuclei expressed two chemosensory receptors simultaneously, these two receptors were considered as co-expressed chemosensory receptors and visualized using the chorddiag package. Figure 4 E uses sctransform-adjusted UMI values, and Figure S5 J uses UMI values from the RNA assay in the final Seurat object.
Antenna chemoreceptor scatterplot: The count scatterplot in Figure S5 F was generated by summing the counts across all cells within each batch for each chemosensory receptor. The sum counts were plotted using the geom_point() function of the ggplot2 package in R ( R Core Team, 2021 84. R Core Team R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing R Foundation for Statistical Computing, 2021 https://www.R-project.org/ Google Scholar ; Wickham, 2016 123. Wickham, H. ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis Springer-Verlag, 2016 https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org Crossref Google Scholar ).
Antenna chemoreceptor expression heatmaps: The heatmaps in Figures 4 F, S6 A, and S5 L–S5P were generating using the DoHeatmap() function on sctransform-normalized expression data. Cells were filtered by either subsetting by cluster identity or for normalized expression of a given gene. Clusters are ordered by co-receptor expression, chemoreceptor genes are ordered by cluster expression. In Figures S5 L and S5M, cells are dimensionally reduced and clusters re-assigned at a resolution of 4 to visualize cell gene expression similarities within a cluster. LOC5575210 expression (ortholog of D. melanogaster nompC ) is likely to not be expressed in chemosensory cells but expressed in the neural population at a similar level to other highly expressed chemoreceptor genes ( Figure S6 A; Data S1 ), thus is included as a non-quantitative demonstration of potential background noise.
Antenna violin plots: Gene expression feature plots were made using the command VlnPlot() on normalized expression values.
The tSNE of maxillary palp nuclei in Figure 6 C was generated similarly to the antenna tSNE, with cluster resolution adjusted to 2.5. The heatmap of all maxillary palp nuclei in Figures 6 B and 6D was plotted as described for the antenna heatmap. The dot plot of all maxillary palp abundant receptors in Figure S7 O was plotted as described for the antenna heatmap. The maxillary palp chord plot in Figure 6 E was processed similarly to the antenna one. Maxillary palp gene expression feature plots were made using the command FeaturePlot() on normalized expression values.
Maxillary palp scatterplot: The co-expression scatterplot in Figures S7 M and S7N was based on the normalization expression from each single nuclei for a pair of chemosensory receptors. The normalization values were plotted using the geom_point() function of the ggplot2 package in R ( R Core Team, 2021 84. R Core Team R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing R Foundation for Statistical Computing, 2021 https://www.R-project.org/ Google Scholar ; Wickham, 2016 123. Wickham, H. ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis Springer-Verlag, 2016 https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org Crossref Google Scholar ).
Female mosquitoes from two wild-type and three mutant strains ( +/+ ORL , +/+ LVP , Ir25a BamHI/BamHI , Gr3 4/4 and Orco 16/16 ) five to seven days post-emergence, were anesthetized on wet ice for 1–2 min. An individual mosquito was then glued onto a piece of double-sided sticky tape on a microscope slide (76 × 26 mm) and secured by a piece of tape covering the thorax and abdomen. The maxillary palps were immobilized using a short segment of human hair placed over the basal part of the maxillary palps. The sensilla of the maxillary palps were subsequently visualized using an Olympus light microscope (BX51WI; LRI Instrument AB, Lund, Sweden) at 750×. A continuous humidified stream of synthetic air (Strandmöllen AB, Ljungby, Sweden) was passed over the maxillary palp (2 L min −1 ) via a glass tube (7 mm i.d.), terminating 10 mm from the maxillary palps, to avoid desiccation.
Electrophysiological recordings from capitate peg sensilla were made and analyzed according to previously described protocols ( Ghaninia et al., 2019 36. Ghaninia, M. ∙ Majeed, S. ∙ Dekker, T. ... Hold your breath - Differential behavioral and sensory acuity of mosquitoes to acetone and carbon dioxide PLoS One. 2019; 14 :e0226815 Crossref Scopus (5) PubMed Google Scholar ; Majeed et al., 2016 63. Majeed, S. ∙ Hill, S.R. ∙ Birgersson, G. ... Detection and perception of generic host volatiles by mosquitoes modulate host preference: context dependence of (R)-1-octen-3-ol R. Soc. Open Sci. 2016; 3 :160467 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, two tungsten microelectrodes, electrolytically sharpened in 10% KNO 2 solution, were used as reference and recording electrodes. The reference electrode was inserted into the eye and the recording electrode was positioned at the base or shaft of the sensillum using a piezo motorized micromanipulator (Märzhäuser Wetzlar GmbH & Co. KG, Wetzlar Germany) until electrical contact was established. Extracellular signals from the OSNs housed in the capitate peg sensilla were amplified and recorded using a high-impedance probe (universal single ended probe) and a USB-acquisition controller (IDAC-4) (Ockenfels Syntech GmbH, Buchenbach, Germany). Extracellular spikes were differentiated based on amplitude as A, B, and C, according to standard nomenclature ( Ghaninia et al., 2019 36. Ghaninia, M. ∙ Majeed, S. ∙ Dekker, T. ... Hold your breath - Differential behavioral and sensory acuity of mosquitoes to acetone and carbon dioxide PLoS One. 2019; 14 :e0226815 Crossref Scopus (5) PubMed Google Scholar ; Majeed et al., 2016 63. Majeed, S. ∙ Hill, S.R. ∙ Birgersson, G. ... Detection and perception of generic host volatiles by mosquitoes modulate host preference: context dependence of (R)-1-octen-3-ol R. Soc. Open Sci. 2016; 3 :160467 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ), and manually counted using Autospike 3.7 (Ockenfels Syntech GmbH). The response to odorant stimuli were analyzed by subtracting the number of spikes 0.5 s post-stimulus from the number of spikes 0.5 s pre-stimulus, and the outcome was multiplied by two to obtain a spike/sec measurement. In cases where the neuronal response was high enough to result in pinching of the spike train (>150 spikes/sec), the number of spikes post-stimulus were counted for the first 100 ms and then multiplied by 5, as the inter-spike frequency is constant once the neuron is activated maximally. Neurons were classified as responders or non-responders based upon whether their odorant response was above or below a 30 spikes/sec threshold, respectively.
Odorants used in Figure 7 were selected for the highest purity available (>98%): R-(−)-1-octen-3-ol (PubChem CID: 6992244, Penta Manufacturing 15–18900); acetone (PubChem CID: 180 Sigma A4206); hexyl amine (PubChem CID: 8102, Sigma 219,703); triethyl amine (PubChem CID: 1146, Sigma T0886). All odorants were diluted into a large stock solution that was used throughout each entire experiment to avoid variability in concentrations. Serial decadic dilutions of acetone, hexyl amine, and triethyl amine were made in MilliQ ultrapure water (18 MΩ resistance) and 1-octen-3-ol was diluted in paraffin oil (EMD Millipore #PX0045-3). Aliquots of 10 μL of each compound and dilution was pipetted onto a piece of filter paper (5 × 20 mm) placed inside a Pasteur pipette. Similar volumes of MilliQ ultrapure water and paraffin oil were used as controls. Stimulus cartridges were used within 5 min after loading, and only used once. For dose-response analysis using CO 2 , gas cylinders containing metered amounts of CO 2 (300, 600, 1200, 4800 ppm) and oxygen (20%), balanced by nitrogen (Strandmöllen AB, Ljungby, Sweden) were used as previously described ( Ghaninia et al., 2019 36. Ghaninia, M. ∙ Majeed, S. ∙ Dekker, T. ... Hold your breath - Differential behavioral and sensory acuity of mosquitoes to acetone and carbon dioxide PLoS One. 2019; 14 :e0226815 Crossref Scopus (5) PubMed Google Scholar ). Odorants were introduced by passing a 0.5 s air puff through the Pasteur pipette using a stimulus controller (Ockenfels Syntech GmbH) into the airstream passing over the maxillary palps through a hole in the glass tube, 10 cm upstream from the preparation.
All statistical analyses were performed using Prism (GraphPad), Excel (Microsoft) or R version 3.6.3 ( R Core Team, 2021 84. R Core Team R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing R Foundation for Statistical Computing, 2021 https://www.R-project.org/ Google Scholar ).
