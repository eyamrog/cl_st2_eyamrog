Title: Developing Covalent Protein Drugs via Proximity-Enabled Reactive Therapeutics


Abstract: Summary

Small molecule covalent drugs provide desirable therapeutic properties over noncovalent ones for treating challenging diseases. The potential of covalent protein drugs, however, remains unexplored due to protein’s inability to bind targets covalently. We report a proximity-enabled reactive therapeutics (PERx) approach to generate covalent protein drugs. Through genetic code expansion, a latent bioreactive amino acid fluorosulfate-L-tyrosine (FSY) was incorporated into human programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1). Only when PD-1 interacts with PD-L1 did the FSY react with a proximal histidine of PD-L1 selectively, enabling irreversible binding of PD-1 to only PD-L1 in vitro and in vivo . When administrated in immune-humanized mice, the covalent PD-1(FSY) exhibited strikingly more potent antitumor effect over the noncovalent wild-type PD-1, attaining therapeutic efficacy equivalent or superior to anti-PD-L1 antibody. PERx should provide a general platform technology for converting various interacting proteins into covalent binders, achieving specific covalent protein targeting for biological studies and therapeutic capability unattainable with conventional noncovalent protein drugs.

Section: Introduction

Small molecule drugs binding to their targets in covalent mode, although historically being intentionally avoided by pharmaceutical researchers and industry, have resurged with great success in recent years ( Singh et al., 2011; Bauer, 2015; Lonsdale and Ward, 2018 3.

Drug Discov. 2011; 10 :307-317 Crossref Scopus (1371) PubMed Google Scholar ). Covalent bonding between drug and target offer multiple desirable features over noncovalent interactions of conventional drugs, including increased biochemical efficiency and potency, prolonged duration of action outlasting the drug pharmacokinetics, improved therapeutic index with reduced dosage and dosing frequency, complete inactivation of target, and opportunity to inhibit intractable targets ( Johnson et al., 2010; Lonsdale and Ward, 2018 14. Johnson, D.S. ∙ Weerapana, E. ∙ Cravatt, B.F. Strategies for discovering and derisking covalent, irreversible enzyme inhibitors Future Med. Chem. 2010; 2 :949-964 Crossref Scopus (301) PubMed Google Scholar 25. Lonsdale, R. ∙ Ward, R.A. Structure-based design of targeted covalent inhibitors Chem. Soc. Rev. 2018; 47 :3816-3830 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). To date, almost 30% of the marketed drugs targeting enzymes act via a covalent mechanism, and targeted covalent inhibition is increasingly applied to a broader range of targets that are challenging with noncovalent drugs ( Robertson, 2005; Johnson et al., 2010 14. Johnson, D.S. ∙ Weerapana, E. ∙ Cravatt, B.F. Strategies for discovering and derisking covalent, irreversible enzyme inhibitors Future Med. Chem. 2010; 2 :949-964 Crossref Scopus (301) PubMed Google Scholar 31. Robertson, J.G. Mechanistic basis of enzyme-targeted drugs Biochemistry. 2005; 44 :5561-5571 Crossref Scopus (224) PubMed Google Scholar ).
In contrast to the blossoming of small molecule covalent drugs, the therapeutic potential of covalent protein drugs remains largely untapped. This gap is due to an inherent limitation of natural proteins: they interact mainly through noncovalent interactions and lack the covalent reactivity toward natural amino acid residues of targets. In addition, the ubiquitous presence of amino acids in proteins, cells, and in vivo imposes a huge challenge to achieve reaction selectivity toward the protein target. The key to develop covalent small molecule drugs has been to strike the right balance between reactivity and selectivity ( Johnson et al., 2010 14. Johnson, D.S. ∙ Weerapana, E. ∙ Cravatt, B.F. Strategies for discovering and derisking covalent, irreversible enzyme inhibitors Future Med. Chem. 2010; 2 :949-964 Crossref Scopus (301) PubMed Google Scholar ). We reason that protein drugs would be particularly suitable for covalent mode of action. A major concern for small molecule covalent drugs is off-target reactivity ( Singh et al., 2011 38. Singh, J. ∙ Petter, R.C. ∙ Baillie, T.A. ... The resurgence of covalent drugs Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2011; 10 :307-317 Crossref Scopus (1371) PubMed Google Scholar ), which can be minimized in covalent protein drugs, because proteins have larger space for selective warhead introduction and generally higher specificity for targets than small molecules. To enable the generation of covalent protein drugs for in vivo usage, we need a novel strategy to engineer into proteins chemical reactivity that is biocompatible and highly specific for the target.
Programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) is a transmembrane receptor modulating the activity of T cells. PD-L1 is a ligand of PD-1 and often overexpressed in different tumors ( Dong et al., 1999; Okazaki and Honjo, 2007 8. Dong, H. ∙ Zhu, G. ∙ Tamada, K. ... B7-H1, a third member of the B7 family, co-stimulates T-cell proliferation and interleukin-10 secretion Nat. Med. 1999; 5 :1365-1369 Crossref Scopus (2020) PubMed Google Scholar 29. Okazaki, T. ∙ Honjo, T. PD-1 and PD-1 ligands: from discovery to clinical application Int. Immunol. 2007; 19 :813-824 Crossref Scopus (1060) PubMed Google Scholar ). The PD-1/PD-L1 interaction inhibits T-lymphocyte proliferation, release of cytokines, and cytotoxicity, resulting in exhaustion and apoptosis of tumor-specific T cells ( Francisco et al., 2010; Sharpe and Pauken, 2018 12.

Sharpe, A.H. ∙ Pauken, K.E. The diverse functions of the PD1 inhibitory pathway Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2018; 18 :153-167 Crossref Scopus (1247) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, the blockage of PD-1/PD-L1 interaction can reverse the dampened antitumor immune response, and several monoclonal antibodies have been developed to target the PD-1/PD-L1 axis for treating cancer ( Sharma and Allison, 2015; Rosenberg et al., 2016; Kaufman et al., 2016; Syed, 2017; Sanmamed and Chen, 2018 16.

However, antibodies have inherent limitations including poor tissue/tumor penetrance and adverse Fc-effector functions that deplete immune cells and induce tissue damage, and patient response to existing PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies varies ( Lee and Tannock, 2010; Maute et al., 2015; Tang et al., 2016 19.

Alternative non-antibody therapeutics with smaller molecular weights are thus being actively sought ( Li et al., 2018a; Zarganes-Tzitzikas et al., 2016 21. Li, C. ∙ Zhang, N. ∙ Zhou, J. ... Peptide Blocking of PD-1/PD-L1 Interaction for Cancer Immunotherapy Cancer Immunol. Res. 2018; 6 :178-188 Crossref Scopus (129) PubMed Google Scholar 53.

Pat. 2016; 26 :973-977 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ). For instance, the ectodomain of PD-1 has been engineered to possess high affinity for PD-L1 and used as competitive antagonist of PD-L1 ( Maute et al., 2015; Lázár-Molnár et al., 2017 18. Lázár-Molnár, E. ∙ Scandiuzzi, L. ∙ Basu, I. ...

Maute, R.L. ∙ Gordon, S.R. ∙ Mayer, A.T. ... Engineering high-affinity PD-1 variants for optimized immunotherapy and immuno-PET imaging Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112 :E6506-E6514 Crossref Scopus (288) PubMed Google Scholar ). Nonetheless, these high-affinity PD-1 antagonists showed mixed success in syngeneic mouse models only, and required the extra appendage of Ig domains for in vivo half-life and efficiency. To overcome these challenges, it would be desirable to generate a covalent linkage between PD-1 and PD-L1, creating an irreversible antagonist possessing infinite affinity that is unreachable with any high-affinity mutants evolved through natural amino acid mutagenesis.
Here, we report a proximity-enabled reactive therapeutics (PERx) strategy to develop covalent protein drugs ( Figure 1 A). Through the expansion of the genetic code ( Wang et al., 2001; Wang and Schultz, 2004; Wang, 2017a 42. Wang, L. Engineering the Genetic Code in Cells and Animals: Biological Considerations and Impacts Acc. Chem. Res. 2017; 50 :2767-2775 Crossref Scopus (81) PubMed Google Scholar 44. Wang, L. ∙ Schultz, P.G. Expanding the genetic code Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2004; 44 :34-66 Crossref Scopus (510) PubMed Google Scholar 45. Wang, L. ∙ Brock, A. ∙ Herberich, B. ... Expanding the genetic code of Escherichia coli Science. 2001; 292 :498-500 Crossref Scopus (1249) PubMed Google Scholar ), we introduce into the protein drug a latent bioreactive unnatural amino acid (Uaa), which has latent chemical reactivity and remains inert inside the protein and in vivo . Upon binding of the protein drug to its target, the bioreactive Uaa is brought into close proximity to a natural residue of the target, which promotes the Uaa to react with the natural residue selectively due to proximity-enabled reactivity ( Xiang et al., 2013 48. Xiang, Z. ∙ Ren, H. ∙ Hu, Y.S. ... Adding an unnatural covalent bond to proteins through proximity-enhanced bioreactivity Nat. Methods. 2013; 10 :885-888 Crossref Scopus (117) PubMed Google Scholar ), thus forming a covalent linkage between the drug and the target specifically. To demonstrate PERx, we genetically incorporated the latent bioreactive Uaa, fluorosulfate-L-tyrosine (FSY) ( Wang et al., 2018 46. Wang, N. ∙ Yang, B. ∙ Fu, C. ... Genetically Encoding Fluorosulfate-l-tyrosine To React with Lysine, Histidine, and Tyrosine via SuFEx in Proteins in Vivo J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2018; 140 :4995-4999 Crossref Scopus (150) PubMed Google Scholar ), into the ectodomain of human PD-1, and showed that the resultant PD-1(FSY) covalently bound to only its natural ligand PD-L1 in vitro , on cancer cell surface, and in tumor in vivo . Compared with PD-1(WT), PD-1(FSY) significantly enhanced the functional activities of human native T cells and engineered chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cells and inhibited tumor growth in several immune-humanized mouse models with strikingly higher efficacy, showing anti-tumor effect equivalent or superior to that of a therapeutic anti-PD-L1 antibody, thus highlighting the robust therapeutic efficacy of covalent protein drugs enabled by PERx over conventional noncovalent protein drugs. We further demonstrated the covalent targeting of the HER2 receptor on breast cancer cells using affibody via PERx. We expect that the PERx strategy can be generally applied to native protein-protein interactions as well as engineered protein binders for developing covalent protein drugs, allowing the potential of this unique therapeutic mechanism to be fully exploited on proteins.

Section: Results

We previously demonstrated that latent bioreactive Uaas can be genetically incorporated into proteins via the expansion of the genetic code ( Xiang et al., 2013 48. Xiang, Z. ∙ Ren, H. ∙ Hu, Y.S. ... Adding an unnatural covalent bond to proteins through proximity-enhanced bioreactivity Nat. Methods. 2013; 10 :885-888 Crossref Scopus (117) PubMed Google Scholar ). These latent bioreactive Uaas are chemically stable in proteins and in cells, but are able to selectively react with a target natural amino acid residue when the Uaa and target natural residue are brought into close proximity ( Xiang et al., 2013; Coin et al., 2013; Wang, 2017b 6. Coin, I. ∙ Katritch, V. ∙ Sun, T. ... Genetically encoded chemical probes in cells reveal the binding path of urocortin-I to CRF class B GPCR Cell. 2013; 155 :1258-1269 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (149) PubMed Google Scholar 43. Wang, L. Genetically encoding new bioreactivity N. Biotechnol. 2017; 38 :16-25 Crossref Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar 48. Xiang, Z. ∙ Ren, H. ∙ Hu, Y.S. ... Adding an unnatural covalent bond to proteins through proximity-enhanced bioreactivity Nat. Methods. 2013; 10 :885-888 Crossref Scopus (117) PubMed Google Scholar ). In particular, we genetically encoded the latent bioreactive Uaa FSY ( Wang et al., 2018 46. Wang, N. ∙ Yang, B. ∙ Fu, C. ... Genetically Encoding Fluorosulfate-l-tyrosine To React with Lysine, Histidine, and Tyrosine via SuFEx in Proteins in Vivo J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2018; 140 :4995-4999 Crossref Scopus (150) PubMed Google Scholar ), which is nontoxic to mammalian cells, remains inert in proteins inside cells, and is able to react with residues Tyr, His, or Lys in proximity via click chemistry sulfur-fluoride exchange (SuFEx), generating stable linkages resistant to hydrolysis ( Figure 1 B; Dong et al., 2014 9. Dong, J. ∙ Krasnova, L. ∙ Finn, M.G. ... Sulfur(VI) fluoride exchange (SuFEx): another good reaction for click chemistry Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2014; 53 :9430-9448 Crossref Scopus (823) PubMed Google Scholar ). The released fluoride ion is found in fluoridated salt, milk, and toothpaste and is excreted through kidneys ( Kanduti et al., 2016 15. Kanduti, D. ∙ Sterbenk, P. ∙ Artnik, B. Fluoride: a Review of Use and Effects on Health Mater. Sociomed. 2016; 28 :133-137 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). We reasoned that introduction of latent bioreactive Uaas into a protein drug at or near the binding interface would enable the Uaa to selectively react with a natural residue of the target protein in response to drug-target binding, allowing the protein drug to covalently bind to its target with high specificity ( Figure 1 A).
The PD-1/PD-L1 immunologic checkpoint was chosen to test the idea: incorporation of a latent bioreactive Uaa into PD-1 would convert PD-1 into a covalent protein drug to block the endogenous PD-1/PD-L1 interaction. On the basis of the crystal structure of human PD-1/PD-L1 complex ( Zak et al., 2015 52. Zak, K.M. ∙ Kitel, R. ∙ Przetocka, S. ... Structure of the Complex of Human Programmed Death 1, PD-1, and Its Ligand PD-L1 Structure. 2015; 23 :2341-2348 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (396) PubMed Google Scholar ), we decided to incorporate FSY at Gln75, Asp77, or Ala129 of PD-1 separately, targeting Lys124, Lys124, and His69 of PD-L1, respectively ( Figure 1 C). FSY was incorporated into the ectodomain of human PD-1 by expressing in E. coli the gene for PD-1 IgV domain with the amber stop codon (TAG) introduced at the desired site, together with the genes for the orthogonal tRNA Pyl /FSYRS pair, which incorporates FSY in response to the TAG codon ( Wang et al., 2018 46. Wang, N. ∙ Yang, B. ∙ Fu, C. ... Genetically Encoding Fluorosulfate-l-tyrosine To React with Lysine, Histidine, and Tyrosine via SuFEx in Proteins in Vivo J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2018; 140 :4995-4999 Crossref Scopus (150) PubMed Google Scholar ). PD-1 mutant proteins were affinity purified (yielding 3.6 mg/L) and refolded (yielding 1.7 mg/L) ( Figures 1 D and S1 A). Mass spectrometric analysis of the mutant protein confirmed that FSY was incorporated into PD-1 at the TAG-specified position in high fidelity ( Figure 1 E).
To test if FSY-incorporated PD-1 ectodomain mutants could bind to human PD-L1 covalently in vitro , we incubated these mutant proteins with PD-L1 protein under mild conditions, followed by SDS-PAGE and western blot analyses ( Figure 2 A). The ectodomain of wild-type human PD-1, referred to as PD-1(WT) hereafter, was purified and included as a control. Although PD-1(WT) and PD-1(77FSY) did not form a covalent complex with PD-L1 under the denatured analysis conditions, a stable covalent complex of PD-1/PD-L1 was detected for PD-1(75FSY) and PD-1(129FSY), with PD-1(129FSY) showing higher covalent crosslinking efficiency (43% ± 4%) than PD-1(75FSY) (16% ± 2%). PD-1(129FSY) crosslinked with PD-L1 with an apparent second-order rate constant of 886 ± 53 M −1 min −1 ( Figures S1 B and S1C). PD-1(129FSY) was thus used in subsequent experiments and hereafter referred to as PD-1(FSY) for clarity. To verify if PD-1(FSY) covalently targeted the proximal His69 of human PD-L1 as designed, we mutated His69 to Ala and found that the resultant PD-L1(H69A) did not form covalent complex with PD-1(FSY) ( Figure 2 B). In addition, we analyzed the incubation product of PD-1(FSY) with PD-L1 using high-resolution mass spectrometry. In the tandem mass spectrum, two series of b and y ions of the crosslinked peptides unambiguously indicated that FSY of PD-1(FSY) specifically reacted with His69 of PD-L1 ( Figure 2 C).
We next tested whether PD-1(FSY) could covalently bind to human PD-L1 physiologically expressed on live cancer cell surface. PD-1(FSY) was incubated with H460 cells (a human large cell lung cancer cell line) or U87 cells (a human primary glioblastoma cell line), which both express PD-L1 on cell surface. After incubation, cells were lysed and the lysate analyzed with western blot ( Figure 2 D). PD-1(WT) did not crosslink with PD-L1, whereas PD-1(FSY) covalently crosslinked with the endogenous full-length PD-L1 on both lines of cancer cells, and the crosslinking efficiency increased with the concentration of PD-1(FSY) applied.
We further tested whether PD-1(FSY) could covalently crosslink with human PD-L1 in tumor tissue in vivo . We engrafted the immunodeficient NSG mice with H460 or U87 cells to form solid tumors. When the tumor size reached 4 × 4 mm 2 , PD-1(WT) or PD-1(FSY) was delivered via tail intravenous injection or peri-tumoral injection. After 3 h, the tumors were dissected for immunoblotting of PD-L1. PD-1(WT) again did not yield any crosslinking with PD-L1, whereas PD-1(FSY) showed apparent covalent crosslinking with PD-L1 in both types of tumor and through both injection methods, with the crosslinking efficiency increased with the doses of PD-1(FSY) injected ( Figure 2 E).
Human PD-L1(H69A) abolished the covalent binding of human PD-1(FSY), indicating that human PD-1(FSY) covalently targeted human PD-L1 with high residue specificity. Human PD-1 is known to cross-bind to mouse PD-L1 ( Lázár-Molnár et al., 2017 18. Lázár-Molnár, E. ∙ Scandiuzzi, L. ∙ Basu, I. ... Structure-guided development of a high-affinity human Programmed Cell Death-1: Implications for tumor immunotherapy EBioMedicine. 2017; 17 :30-44 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ). To evaluate the covalent targeting specificity of human PD-1(FSY) toward other proteins, we tested if human PD-1(FSY) could covalently bind to mouse PD-L1 on mouse cell surface. Immune cells from mouse thymus and spleen were dissociated and incubated with human PD-1(WT) and PD-1(FSY), followed with similar analysis. No covalent crosslinking of human PD-1(WT) or PD-1(FSY) with mouse PD-L1 was detected ( Figure S2 A). Homology alignment of human and mouse PD-L1 sequences indicates that the target His69 of human PD-L1 corresponds to Ala69 of mouse PD-L1 ( Figure S2 B; Tan et al., 2016 40. Tan, S. ∙ Chen, D. ∙ Liu, K. ... Crystal clear: visualizing the intervention mechanism of the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction by two cancer therapeutic monoclonal antibodies Protein Cell. 2016; 7 :866-877 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ), which cannot react with FSY ( Wang et al., 2018 46. Wang, N. ∙ Yang, B. ∙ Fu, C. ... Genetically Encoding Fluorosulfate-l-tyrosine To React with Lysine, Histidine, and Tyrosine via SuFEx in Proteins in Vivo J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2018; 140 :4995-4999 Crossref Scopus (150) PubMed Google Scholar ). This residue selectivity of PERx thus achieves high target specificity, allowing human PD-1(FSY) to distinguish human PD-L1 from mouse PD-L1 for covalent targeting. In addition, to evaluate if there was any off-target covalent crosslinking of human PD-1(FSY) to other proteins of cancer cells and tumor in vivo , we analyzed the human PD-1(FSY) treated cancer cells and tumors with western blot using anti-human PD-1 antibody ( Figures S2 C–S2E). No other proteins were detected to covalently bind to human PD-1(FSY), indicating that human PD-1(FSY) covalently targeted human PD-L1 on cancer cells in vitro and in vivo in a specific manner.
Taken together, human PD-1(FSY) covalently bound to human PD-L1 through FSY129 of PD-1 reacting with His69 of PD-L1. The covalent binding can be achieved efficiently and specifically with purified target proteins, target proteins expressed on cultured cancer cells in vitro , and target proteins expressed in tumor tissues in vivo .
To examine if the covalent binding ability of PD-1(FSY) could enhance T cell activation by blocking PD-1/PD-L1 interaction, we performed an allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) in vitro . Dendritic cells express PD-L1, which interacts with PD-1 expressed on T cells to restrict T cell proliferation and activation. Mature dendritic cells were derived from monocytes isolated from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of healthy donors, with PD-L1 expression confirmed by flow cytometry ( Figure S3 ). The mature dendritic cells were separately treated with PD-1(WT), PD-1(FSY), or atezolizumab (a Food and Drug Administration [FDA]-approved cancer treating monoclonal antibody against human PD-L1) ( Akinleye and Rasool, 2019 1. Akinleye, A. ∙ Rasool, Z. Immune checkpoint inhibitors of PD-L1 as cancer therapeutics J. Hematol. Oncol. 2019; 12 :92 Crossref Scopus (508) PubMed Google Scholar ) for 2 h, and then co-cultured with allogeneic CD3 + T cells that were purified from the peripheral blood of healthy donors and pre-stained with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) dye for monitoring T cell proliferation. After co-culturing for 5 days, CFSE-positive CD3 + T cells were analyzed with flow cytometry ( Figure 3 A). As shown in the PBS control, co-culturing with allogeneic dendritic cells increased T cell proliferation, indicated by the increase of CFSE positive cells with CFSE intensity lower than the parental population (CFSE low ) ( Figure 3 B). In comparison with the PBS control, PD-1(WT) did not increase T cell proliferation at concentrations from 50 to 250 nM. In contrast, PD-1(FSY) elicited a significant enhancement of T cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. The T cell activation effect of PD-1(FSY) was comparable to that of atezolizumab applied at the same molar concentrations.
In addition, the level of interferon γ (IFN-γ) released by T cells in the co-culture was measured to indicate T cell activation ( Figure 3 C). In comparison with the PBS control, PD-1(WT) did not significantly increase IFN-γ production at the concentration of 50 and 250 nM. In contrast, PD-1(FSY) elicited a marked increase of IFN-γ production (3.4-fold) at 50 nM, and a further increase to 4.1-fold at 250 nM. The effect on IFN-γ production of PD-1(FSY) was again comparable to that of atezolizumab. Therefore, similarly to atezolizumab, PD-1(FSY) could significantly enhance T cell activation induced by allogeneic dendritic cells through blocking PD-1/PD-L1 interaction, whereas PD-1(WT) could not.
Given the ability of PD-1(FSY) to bind PD-L1 irreversibly and to promote T cell activation in vitro , we sought to evaluate its antitumor activity in vivo . Two high-affinity mutants of human PD-1 previously reported both cross-bind to mouse PD-L1, and their antitumor effect was evaluated for inhibiting mouse PD-L1 in mouse models with a normal murine immune system only ( Maute et al., 2015; Lázár-Molnár et al., 2017 18. Lázár-Molnár, E. ∙ Scandiuzzi, L. ∙ Basu, I. ... Structure-guided development of a high-affinity human Programmed Cell Death-1: Implications for tumor immunotherapy EBioMedicine. 2017; 17 :30-44 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar 27. Maute, R.L. ∙ Gordon, S.R. ∙ Mayer, A.T. ... Engineering high-affinity PD-1 variants for optimized immunotherapy and immuno-PET imaging Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112 :E6506-E6514 Crossref Scopus (288) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because PD-1(FSY) was covalently specific to human PD-L1 but not to mouse PD-L1, we did not use syngeneic immune competent mouse models but resorted to immune deficient mouse models reconstituted with human immune cells, which allow the evaluation of the engrafted human immune system against the human tumors ( De La Rochere et al., 2018 7. De La Rochere, P. ∙ Guil-Luna, S. ∙ Decaudin, D. ... Humanized Mice for the Study of Immuno-Oncology Trends Immunol. 2018; 39 :748-763 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (203) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Human PBMCs were activated with anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies for 3 days and then co-cultured with human tumor H460 cells for 7 days ( Figure 4 A). A mixture of these PBMCs and H460 (ratio 1:4) were subcutaneously injected into the flanks of immunodeficient NSG mice. PD-1 proteins or atezolizumab were subsequently administrated via the intravenous tail injection every 3 days (for low dose) or every 6 days (for high dose). Tumor growth was monitored for 44 days. As expected, the tumors of vehicle-treated mice (i.e., PBS control) grew rapidly. Treatment with 22 μg of PD-1(WT) slowed down the tumor growth moderately, while treating with 22 μg of PD-1(FSY) dramatically inhibited the tumor growth (p < 0.0001) ( Figures 4 B and S4 A) during the entire course. Reduction of the PD-1(FSY) dose to 11 μg maintained similar tumor suppressive effects as the dose of 22 μg. In fact, PD-1(FSY) reached the same antitumor effect with atezolizumab administrated in the same molar quantities, but the mass quantities of PD-1(FSY) was only one-tenth of atezolizumab. The weight of PD-1(FSY)-treated tumors was significantly lower than those treated with PD-1(WT) (p < 0.001), and was comparable to those treated with atezolizumab ( Figures 4 C and S4 B).
We further evaluated the therapeutic potential of PD-1(FSY) to modulate CAR-T cell activity. CAR-T cells have shown outstanding efficacy against some hematopoietic malignancies, but are not effective against solid tumors due to the presence of tumor immune suppressive microenvironment ( Newick et al., 2017; Mardiana et al., 2019 26. Mardiana, S. ∙ Solomon, B.J. ∙ Darcy, P.K. ... Supercharging adoptive T cell therapy to overcome solid tumor-induced immunosuppression Sci. Transl. Med. 2019; 11 :eaaw2293 Crossref Scopus (101) PubMed Google Scholar 28. Newick, K. ∙ O’Brien, S. ∙ Moon, E. ... CAR T Cell Therapy for Solid Tumors Annu. Rev. Med. 2017; 68 :139-152 Crossref Scopus (623) PubMed Google Scholar ). Methods to enhance CAR-T activity in solid tumors are thus desirable. We first examined if PD-1(FSY) could activate human CAR-T cells in vitro . We generated CAR-EphA2 T cells by expressing a CAR specific for the EphA2 receptor in human T cells through lentiviral transduction ( Figure S5 A). H460 and U87 cells are positive for both PD-L1 and EphA2 expression as confirmed by flow cytometry ( Figure S5 B). When CAR-EphA2 T cells were co-cultured with H460 cells, PD-1 expression on the CAR-EphA2 T cells was significantly upregulated in comparison with CAR-EphA2 T cells cultured alone ( Figures 5 A and S5 C). Similar upregulation of PD-1 was also detected when CAR-EphA2 T cells were co-cultured with the U87 cells ( Figures S5 C and S6 A). These data indicate that the CAR-EphA2 T cells were activated initially by H460 or U87 cells, but could be inhibited by PD-1/PD-L1 interaction after the upregulation of PD-1 on CAR-T cells.
We next added PD-1 proteins or Atezolizumab to the co-culture of CAR-EphA2 T cells with H460 or U87 cells. After 12 h, T cells were analyzed for CD69 expression, a marker for T cell activation. As shown by the PBS control in Figure 5 B, compared with CAR-EphA2 T cells cultured alone, co-culturing of CAR-EphA2 T cells with H460 cells activated the CAR-EphA2 T cells, reflecting the baseline activation by H460 cells. Treating the co-culture with PD-1(WT) did not result in significant increase of CAR-EphA2 T cell activation in comparison with the PBS baseline. In contrast, treating the co-culture with PD-1(FSY) enhanced CAR-EphA2 T cell activation significantly, as reflected by the increase of CD69 + T cells ( Figure 5 B). Similar CAR-T activation results were also obtained for CAR-EphA2 T cells co-cultured with U87 cells and treated with the same panel of protein drugs ( Figure S6 B). These results indicate that, when CAR-T cells were stimulated by their target cancer cells, PD-1(FSY) could significantly enhance CAR-T cell activation in vitro , whereas PD-1(WT) could not.
We subsequently evaluated if PD-1(FSY) could collaborate with CAR-EphA2T cells to inhibit the growth of established human tumors in NSG mice. NSG mice were injected subcutaneously with H460 cells to engraft the tumor. When the tumor grew to 5 × 5 mm 2 , human CAR-EphA2 T cells were administrated twice, and PD-1(WT), PD-1(FSY), or atezolizumab was administrated every 4 days ( Figure 5 C). Tumor grew rapidly in mice injected with non-engineered T cells ( Figures 5 D and S6 C). Injection of CAR-EphA2 T cells without proteins drugs (i.e., PBS control) slowed down the tumor growth significantly, consistent with the antitumor ability of CAR-EphA2 T cells. Additional treatment with PD-1(WT) slightly reduced the tumor growth more in comparison with the PBS control. In contrast, treatment with PD-1(FSY) markedly diminished tumor growth further when compared with PD-1(WT) (p < 0.0001), reaching the same inhibition level of Atezolizumab. Endpoint analysis of tumor weight showed the same effects ( Figures 5 E and S6 D): the tumor weight was significantly reduced in response to the use of CAR-EphA2 T cells over non-engineered T cells; although PD-1(WT) treatment did not result in significant tumor weight reduction than the PBS control, treatment with PD-1(FSY) or atezolizumab significantly reduced the tumor weight further over PD-1(WT) (p < 0.001). 22 μg of PD-1(FSY) achieved the same tumor inhibition effect of 200 μg of atezolizumab.
To analyze CAR-EphA2 T cell infiltration into tumor after treatment, we dissociated the harvested tumor tissue into single cells and detected CAR-EphA2 T cells using flow cytometry. In tumors treated with PD-1(FSY), we detected significantly more CD4 + CAR-EphA2 helper T cells and CD8 + CAR-EphA2 cytotoxic T cells than in tumors treated with PD-1(WT) (p < 0.001) ( Figures 5 F and 5G), showing T cell infiltration levels similar to those found in tumors treated with atezolizumab. We further checked the activation status of these CAR-T cells by CD69 expression: PD-1(FSY) treatment significantly enhanced the activation of both CD4 + and CD8 + CAR-EphA2 T cells in tumor than PD-1(WT) treatment (p < 0.0001), reaching the same (for CD4 + ) as or a higher (for CD8 + ) activation level than the atezolizumab treatment ( Figures 5 H and 5I). Moreover, we quantitatively analyzed the mRNA level of other markers in tumor-infiltrating CAR-EphA2 T cells ( Figure S6 E). Compared with PD-1(WT), PD-1(FSY) treatment led to significant upregulation of interleukin-2 (IL-2), a cytokine for T cell proliferation, and upregulation of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), an effector for T cell activity. Meanwhile, T cell exhaustion-associated genes TIM-3 and LAG-3 were both downregulated. These results confirm that PD-1(FSY) had similar functional effects on CAR-EphA2 T cell activity as atezolizumab. Taken together, PD-1(FSY) significantly enhanced CAR-T cell infiltration and activity in tumors, achieving much better antitumor effect over PD-1(WT) in vivo .
The approaches of human PBMCs and CAR-T cells mainly supply only human T cells that can survive for a short period of time in vivo and cause graft versus host diseases. A more physiologically relevant immune system humanized mouse model is the bone marrow-liver-thymus mouse generated by co-transplantation of human fetal thymus and autologous fetal liver CD34 + hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), denoted Hu-mice ( Allen et al., 2019; Lan et al., 2006; Zhao et al., 2015; Rong et al., 2014 2.

Humanized Mice Reveal Differential Immunogenicity of Cells Derived from Autologous Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells Cell Stem Cell. 2015; 17 :353-359 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (184) PubMed Google Scholar ). Hu-mice have sustained human immune system with a comprehensive array of human lymphohematopoietic cells including T cells, B cells, and dendritic cells, allowing normal human T cell maturation in the presence of human autologous MHCs within a human thymus environment ( Wege, 2018 47. Wege, A.K. Humanized Mouse Models for the Preclinical Assessment of Cancer Immunotherapy BioDrugs. 2018; 32 :245-266 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ). To further evaluate antitumor effect of PD-1(FSY) in the presence of this physiologically relevant immune system, H460 cells were injected subcutaneously in the flanks of the Hu-mice. H460 tumor cells formed tumors in Hu-mice, indicating that H460 tumors formed immune suppressive microenvironment to protect the tumors from allogeneic immune system. These H460 tumor-loaded Hu-mice were randomized into five cohorts, and were injected with PBS, PD-1(WT), PD-1(FSY), or atezolizumab through tail vein every 4 days ( Figure 6 A).
PD-1(WT) did not slow down tumor growth significantly in comparison with the vehicle PBS control ( Figures 6 B and S7 A). In contrast, PD-1(FSY) (22 μg) dramatically reduced the tumor growth when compared with PD-1(WT) (22 μg). In addition, the tumor inhibiting effect of PD-1(FSY) (22 μg) was comparable with that of atezolizumab (200 μg), and increasing the dose of PD-1(FSY) to 200 μg showed significant better antitumor effect than atezolizumab (200 μg) (p < 0.0001). Endpoint analysis of tumor weight confirmed the above trend ( Figures 6 C and S7 B): PD-1(FSY) (22 μg) significantly reduced the tumor weight than PD-1(WT) (22 μg) (p < 0.001), with antitumor effect comparable to atezolizumab (200 μg). The mean weight of tumor treated by 22 μg of PD-1(FSY) was 0.0188 g, which was close to half of that (0.0356 g) treated by 200 μg of atezolizumab: the difference was not significant when compared with one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test ( Figure 6 C), but was statistically significant (p = 0.0286) when compared with Mann-Whitney test ( Figure S7 C). In addition, when the same dose of 200 μg was used, tumors treated by PD-1(FSY) were significantly smaller than those treated by atezolizumab (p < 0.05, Figure 6 C).
In contrast to tumors formed in immunodeficient mice that failed to develop immune suppressive microenvironment, tumors formed in Hu-mice developed potent immune suppressive microenvironment that is characteristic of tumors in human patients. Therefore, solid tumors developed in Hu-mice should better mimic the clinical settings of cancer patients than the PBMC or CAR-T cell models. The fact that PD-1(FSY) exhibited better therapeutic efficacy than PD-1(WT) and atezolizumab (an FDA-approved antibody for treating multiple cancers) in this immune-humanized mouse model supports the high potential of PD-1(FSY) as a non-antibody protein drug for cancer treatment. Combining PD-1(FSY) with other immuno-oncology agents such as immune checkpoint inhibitors or stimulators may synergize and afford more robust cures.
In addition to converting the native interacting protein pair PD-1/PD-L1 into covalent binders, we also sought to convert engineered protein binders into proteins with selective covalent targeting ability to indicate the broad application of PERx. Derived from staphylococcal protein A, affibody is designed as an alternative to immunoglobulin-based binding proteins. An affibody Z HER2 binds to the tyrosine kinase receptor HER2 in high affinity (K D = 22 pM) ( Orlova et al., 2006 30. Orlova, A. ∙ Magnusson, M. ∙ Eriksson, T.L.J. ... Tumor imaging using a picomolar affinity HER2 binding affibody molecule Cancer Res. 2006; 66 :4339-4348 Crossref Scopus (469) PubMed Google Scholar ). We reasoned that introducing FSY into the Z HER2 near the binding interface would allow FSY to react with a nucleophilic residue of HER2 only upon binding, affording covalent targeting of the HER2 receptor in high specificity ( Figure 7 A).
On the basis of the crystal structure of the Z HER2 /HER2 complex ( Figure 7 B; Eigenbrot et al., 2010 10. Eigenbrot, C. ∙ Ultsch, M. ∙ Dubnovitsky, A. ... Structural basis for high-affinity HER2 receptor binding by an engineered protein Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107 :15039-15044 Crossref Scopus (166) PubMed Google Scholar ), we decided to incorporate FSY at site Asp36 or Asp37 of Z HER2 to target the proximal His490 of HER2. A dimeric form of Z HER2 (dZ HER2 ) was generated to further increase the binding affinity for HER2 (K D = 6 pM) ( Ekerljung et al., 2012 11. Ekerljung, L. ∙ Lennartsson, J. ∙ Gedda, L. The HER2-binding affibody molecule (Z(HER2:342)) 2 increases radiosensitivity in SKBR-3 cells PLoS ONE. 2012; 7 :e49579 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ), with FSY incorporated in the N-terminal Z HER2 monomer. The resultant dZ HER2 (36FSY) and dZ HER2 (37FSY) proteins were purified and individually incubated with the purified HER2 extracellular domain. In denatured immunoblot, a covalent complex of dZ HER2 binding to HER2 was detected for both dZ HER2 (36FSY) and dZ HER2 (37FSY), but not for dZ HER2 (WT) ( Figure 7 C), indicating FSY-mediated covalent targeting of HER2. During storage dZ HER2 (36FSY) tended to form dimers but dZ HER2 (37FSY) did not. dZ HER2 (37FSY) crosslinked with HER2 showing an apparent second-order rate constant of 4,188 ± 176 M −1 min −1 ( Figure S8 A).
To test if dZ HER2 (FSY) could covalently target HER2 on live cancer cell surface, dZ HER2 proteins were incubated with SKBR3 cells, a human breast cancer cell line overexpressing HER2. Cell lysates were immunoblotted for dZ HER2 under denatured conditions ( Figure 7 D). Despite the extremely high affinity (6 pM) of dZ HER2 (WT) for HER2, dZ HER2 (WT) could not remain binding to HER2, whereas both dZ HER2 (36FSY) and dZ HER2 (37FSY) stably crosslinked the endogenous full-length HER2 receptor on SKBR3 cells. The crosslinking efficiency increased with the dZ HER2 (FSY) dose. The HER2 receptor on SKBR3 cells were crosslinked by 1 μM of dZ HER2 (37FSY) in 50% at 4 h and 68% at 8 h ( Figure S8 B). In addition, for dZ HER2 (37FSY)-treated SKBR3 cells, the entire western blot detected dZ HER2 (37FSY), the covalent complex of dZ HER2 (37FSY)/HER2, and a nonspecific band (also appeared in the PBS control); no other bands were detected containing dZ HER2 (37FSY), suggesting that dZ HER2 (37FSY) covalently targeted only the HER2 receptor on cell surface in high specificity. Therefore, PERx can provide a general platform to specifically target protein receptors covalently.

Section: Discussion

Although high-affinity mutants of proteins or antibodies can be evolved for tighter binding, such binding remains noncovalent and reversible in nature. PERx-enabled covalent protein drugs afford a fundamentally different mechanism—irreversible binding, which leads to unique therapeutic properties that are ardently pursued with small molecule covalent drugs while hitherto infeasible with proteins. The covalent PD-1(FSY) potently enhanced anti-tumor activity in the humanized tumor mouse models. In contrast, a PD-1 mutant exhibiting 45-fold affinity increase in vitro fails to provide any antitumor effect in mouse model when administrated alone ( Lázár-Molnár et al., 2017 18. Lázár-Molnár, E. ∙ Scandiuzzi, L. ∙ Basu, I. ... Structure-guided development of a high-affinity human Programmed Cell Death-1: Implications for tumor immunotherapy EBioMedicine. 2017; 17 :30-44 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ). Another high-affinity PD-1 mutant (HAC–PD-1) showed antitumor enhancement in a syngeneic mouse model with a normal murine immune system only ( Maute et al., 2015 27. Maute, R.L. ∙ Gordon, S.R. ∙ Mayer, A.T. ... Engineering high-affinity PD-1 variants for optimized immunotherapy and immuno-PET imaging Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112 :E6506-E6514 Crossref Scopus (288) PubMed Google Scholar ), but its performance in humanized mouse model, which is preclinically more predictive for onco-immunotherapy, remains unknown. In addition, while generating high affinity through directed evolution often necessitates multiple mutations of the starting protein (e.g., the HAC–PD-1 has 10 mutations) ( Maute et al., 2015 27. Maute, R.L. ∙ Gordon, S.R. ∙ Mayer, A.T. ... Engineering high-affinity PD-1 variants for optimized immunotherapy and immuno-PET imaging Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112 :E6506-E6514 Crossref Scopus (288) PubMed Google Scholar ), PERx strategy introduces a single mutation only into native human protein, which simplifies the procedure and should minimize potential immunogenicity. Protein drugs generally need to be modified to extend their half-life in vivo to achieve efficacy, whereas the irreversible binding ability of PERx drugs obviates this requirement because covalent binding decouples drug efficacy from pharmacokinetics. Indeed, PD-1(WT) has short half-life in vivo and the reported PD-1 high-affinity mutants thus all need fusion of Ig domains for half-life extension, which could lead to undesirable and risky side effects ( Lázár-Molnár et al., 2017; Maute et al., 2015 18. Lázár-Molnár, E. ∙ Scandiuzzi, L. ∙ Basu, I. ... Structure-guided development of a high-affinity human Programmed Cell Death-1: Implications for tumor immunotherapy EBioMedicine. 2017; 17 :30-44 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar 27. Maute, R.L. ∙ Gordon, S.R. ∙ Mayer, A.T. ... Engineering high-affinity PD-1 variants for optimized immunotherapy and immuno-PET imaging Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112 :E6506-E6514 Crossref Scopus (288) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast, PD-1(FSY) was simply used in its original form without further modifications, achieving same therapeutic efficacy as the antibody atezolizumab with long half-life.
In comparison with antibodies, PERx drugs start from a human native protein and thus will bind the target at a clinically relevant epitope, in contrast to random epitopes recognized by antibodies. In addition, small proteins with molecular weights below the renal glomerular filtration threshold are quickly cleared in vivo and thus are not suitable for in vivo usage as drugs, but they are preferred over large antibodies for various conditions such as extravasation, tissue penetration, and tumor filtration and accumulation. PERx now enables the use of such small-protein biologics as therapeutics in vivo . The molecular weight of PD-1(FSY) is just 15.6 kDa, approximately an order of magnitude smaller than a monoclonal antibody (150 kDa). PD-1(FSY) was produced in E. coli in high yield, excellent reproducibility, and low cost, affording manufactural advantages over antibodies.
Off-target reaction is a critical concern for small molecule covalent drugs, but PERx strategy minimizes the off-target activity for covalent protein drugs. The unique mechanism of PERx safeguards the reaction specificity of the protein drug toward its target. First, the reactivity of the warhead used in the Uaa, aryl fluorosulfonate, is latent. Aryl fluorosulfonate installed on small molecules has been shown essentially unreactive toward the proteome and becomes activated only upon binding to a specific protein with side-chain functional groups capable of catalyzing SuFEx reaction ( Chen et al., 2016 4. Chen, W. ∙ Dong, J. ∙ Plate, L. ... Arylfluorosulfates Inactivate Intracellular Lipid Binding Protein(s) through Chemoselective SuFEx Reaction with a Binding Site Tyr Residue J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2016; 138 :7353-7364 Crossref Scopus (194) PubMed Google Scholar ). In PERx, the warhead is incorporated into the protein drug, the larger size of which will shield the warhead from binding to unwanted proteins. We have also shown that the latent bioreactive Uaa containing this warhead, FSY, is nontoxic in mammalian cells ( Wang et al., 2018 46. Wang, N. ∙ Yang, B. ∙ Fu, C. ... Genetically Encoding Fluorosulfate-l-tyrosine To React with Lysine, Histidine, and Tyrosine via SuFEx in Proteins in Vivo J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2018; 140 :4995-4999 Crossref Scopus (150) PubMed Google Scholar ). Second, the reactivity of latent bioreactive Uaa entails the specific binding of the protein drug toward the target. As demonstrated herein, incubation of PD-1(FSY) with cancer cells in culture resulted in covalent binding of PD-1(FSY) with its target PD-L1 only. Furthermore, injection of PD-1(FSY) in mouse in vivo also did not result in off-target binding of other proteins besides PD-L1. The selective binding of the protein drug toward its target(s) thus provides an excellent level of specificity. Third, the reactivity of the protein drug further entails the proper contact of the latent bioreactive Uaa with a suitable natural residue of the bound protein. This requirement is driven by the proximity-enabled reactivity mechanism of PERx, ensuring a highly stringent level of specificity. FSY is able to react with His, Lys, or Tyr via proximity-enabled reaction. We demonstrated that PD-1(FSY) covalently bound to PD-L1 via FSY selectively reacting with His69 of PD-L1 using mass spectrometry; as another evidence of this stringent specificity, mutation of His69 to Ala abolished the covalent binding. In addition, despite that human PD-1(WT) binds to both human and mouse PD-L1, human PD-1(FSY) covalently crosslinked human but not mouse PD-L1, because mouse PD-L1, although highly homologous to human PD-L1 (77%) ( Lin et al., 2008 23. Lin, D.Y.-W. ∙ Tanaka, Y. ∙ Iwasaki, M. ... The PD-1/PD-L1 complex resembles the antigen-binding Fv domains of antibodies and T cell receptors Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105 :3011-3016 Crossref Scopus (343) PubMed Google Scholar ), has an Ala at site 69. Therefore, even if the protein drug can bind to multiple protein targets, covalent specificity can still be achieved toward a single target by judiciously placing the Uaa to pair Uaa-target residue for selective reaction. In short, covalent reactivity in PERx necessitates both drug-target binding and Uaa-natural residue pairing, thus uniquely affording unusual specificity and target selectivity.
PERx has straightforward procedures and only minimally modifies the protein with a point mutation. With the expanding repertoire of latent bioreactive Uaas being genetically encoded to selectively react with different natural residues through proximity-enabled reactivity ( Xiang et al., 2014; Wang, 2017b; Xuan et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2019 24. Liu, J. ∙ Li, S. ∙ Aslam, N.A. ... Genetically Encoding Photocaged Quinone Methide to Multitarget Protein Residues Covalently in Vivo J. Am. Chem.

Wang, N. ∙ Yang, B. ∙ Fu, C. ... Genetically Encoding Fluorosulfate-l-tyrosine To React with Lysine, Histidine, and Tyrosine via SuFEx in Proteins in Vivo J. Am. Chem.

Engl. 2017; 56 :5096-5100 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ), the PERx strategy should be able to covalently target a broad range of proteins. We thus expect PERx become a general platform technology to convert various interacting proteins into covalent protein drugs, which will lead to the rapid development of covalent protein drugs, a new class of protein therapeutics holding unique potential for exploration. In addition, PERx can also be applied to existing protein drugs and binders such as antibody, nanobody, and affibody, readily enabling them covalent targeting ability, as demonstrated by the affibody dZ HER2 (FSY) here. All resultant covalent proteins will have zero off-rate and infinite affinity, providing unique and desirable properties (e.g., irreversible binding, high sensitivity, low background) for applications in therapeutics, diagnostics, imaging, as well as single cell analysis. Moreover, because PERx uses genetically encoded Uaas ( Wang, 2017a 42. Wang, L. Engineering the Genetic Code in Cells and Animals: Biological Considerations and Impacts Acc. Chem.

Mice were randomly assigned to experimental groups.
Plasmid pET-26b-PD1(WT) was generated by cloning the human PD-1 IgV domain encoding gene (residues 32-160, Cys93 was replaced with Ser to aid protein stability ( Zak et al., 2015 52. Zak, K.M. ∙ Kitel, R. ∙ Przetocka, S. ... Structure of the Complex of Human Programmed Death 1, PD-1, and Its Ligand PD-L1 Structure. 2015; 23 :2341-2348 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (396) PubMed Google Scholar )) into pET-26b vector with a carboxyl-terminal 6x Histidine tag. Briefly, the DNA for hPD-1 IgV domain (32-160, C93S) was amplified with primers (PD-1 WT-F and PD-1 WT-R) by Q5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerases (NEB, Cat# M0491) from plasmid pUC57-Kan-hPD-1 IgV domain (32-160, C93S), which was codon optimized and synthesized by GENEWIZ (China, Suzhou). The PCR product was digested with Nde I-HF and Xho I-HF and ligated into the precut pET-26b vector using T4 DNA ligase (NEB, Cat# M0202L).
To introduce the TAG codon at sites D77 or A129, the following primer pairs (D77-F1 with D77-R1, D77-F2 with D77-R2, A129-F1 with A129-R1, and A129-F2 with A129-R2) were used to perform overlapping PCR with Q5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerases and using plasmid pET-26b-PD1(WT) as the template. The amplified PCR product was digested with Nde I-HF and Xho I-HF, and then ligated into the precut pET-26b vector to afford plasmid pET-26b-PD-1(D77TAG) or pET-26b-PD-1(A129TAG).
To introduce the TAG codon at site Q75, primers Q75F and Q75R were used to perform site-directed mutagenesis on plasmid pET-26b-PD1(WT) using the Fast site-directed mutagenesis kit (Tiangen, Cat# KM101).
Plasmid pET-26b-PD-L1(WT) was generated by cloning the human PD-L1 IgV domain encoding gene (residues 19-134) into plasmid pET-26b. Briefly, the hPD-L1 IgV domain (19-134) was amplified with primers (PD-L1-F and PD-L1-R) from plasmid pUC57-Kan- hPD-L1 IgV domain (19-134), which was codon optimized and synthetized by GENEWIZ (China, Suzhou). The PCR product was digested with Nde I-HF and Xho I-HF, and then ligated into the precut pET-26b vector.
Plasmid pET-26b-PD-L1(H69A) was generated by performing site-directed mutagenesis on plasmid pET-26b-PD-L1(WT) using primers (H69A-F and H69A-R) and the Fast site-directed mutagenesis kit (Tiangen, Cat# KM101).
Plasmids pET-26b-PD1(WT), pET-26b-PD-L1(WT), and pET-26b-PD-L1(H69A) were separately transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) electro-competent cells. Plasmid pET-26b-PD-1(Q75TAG), pET-26b-PD-1(D77TAG), or pET-26b-PD-1(A129TAG) was co-transform with plasmid pEvol-FSYRS ( Wang et al., 2018 46. Wang, N. ∙ Yang, B. ∙ Fu, C. ... Genetically Encoding Fluorosulfate-l-tyrosine To React with Lysine, Histidine, and Tyrosine via SuFEx in Proteins in Vivo J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2018; 140 :4995-4999 Crossref Scopus (150) PubMed Google Scholar ) into E. coli BL21(DE3) electro-competent cells. For expression of PD-1(WT), PD-L1(WT) and PD-L1(H69A), transformed bacteria were cultured at 37°C in 2xYT media with 50 μg/mL kanamycin and induced with 1 mM IPTG when OD 600 reached 0.8. For incorporation of FSY into proteins, transformed bacteria were cultured at 37°C in 2xYT media with 50 μg/mL kanamycin and 34 μg/mL chloramphenicol and induced with 1 mM IPTG, 0.2% arabinose, and 1mM FSY when OD 600 reached 0.8. After induction of expression for 12 h, bacteria were collected by centrifugation at 7000 rpm for 5 min at 4°C. The cell pellets were re-suspended in 10 mL lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, lysozyme 1 mg/mL, DNase 0.1mg/mL, and protease inhibitors) per gram of bacteria wet weight. The cell suspension was lysed at 4°C for 30 min by shaking, and subsequently sonicated with Sonic Dismembrator (Fisher Scientific, 30% output, 3 min, 1 s off, 1 s on) in an ice-water bath. Inclusion bodies were recovered by centrifugation of the cells lysate at 20,000 g for 20 min at 4°C, and then re-suspended in inclusion body 1 st wash buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl,10 mM EDTA). The resuspended solution was centrifugated again at 20,000 g for 20 min at 4°C, and re-suspended in inclusion body 2 nd wash buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl). The resuspended solution was then centrifugated at 20,000 g for 20 min at 4°C, and re-suspended in inclusion body solubilization buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 8 M urea), followed by stirring at 4°C overnight. Solubilized fraction was clarified by centrifugation at 30,000 g for 30 min at 4°C. Appropriate volume of Ni-NTA agarose beads (QIAGEN, Cat# 30210) were added into the supernatant and incubated at 4°C for 30 min by shaking. The mixture was loaded in a column and washed with wash buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 8 M urea, 4 mM imidazole) in 10 column volume. The protein was eluted with elution buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 8 M urea, 300 mM imidazole) and diluted below 0.1 mg/mL with dilution buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 8 M urea). The diluted protein solution was loaded into a dialysis bag (MD44-1500-01, MWCO = 1.5 kDa) to dialyze and refold the protein through gradient reducing of urea concentration (6 M, 4 M, 2 M, 0 M, sequentially) in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl. At each urea concentration the dialysis was carried out by stirring at 4°C for 6 h ( Lee et al., 2016 20. Lee, J.Y. ∙ Lee, H.T. ∙ Shin, W. ... Structural basis of checkpoint blockade by monoclonal antibodies in cancer immunotherapy Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 :13354 Crossref Scopus (219) PubMed Google Scholar ). The refolded protein solution in 0 M urea buffer was loaded into an ultrafiltration centrifugation tube (Millipore, Cat# UFC900324, MWCO = 3 kDa) to concentrate and exchange buffer into PBS (pH 7.3) (for cells and animals experiments) or 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl (for in vitro protein crosslinking experiments) three times. Protein concentration was measured by nanodrop (Thermo Fisher) based on its molecular weight and extinction coefficient. For PD-1(WT), molecular weight is 15.57 kDa and extinction coefficient is 14.11. For PD-L1(WT), molecular weight is 14.41 kDa and extinction coefficient is 17.55. The refolded proteins were stored at −80°C. For PD-1 (WT), the yield was 27.3 mg/L after Ni-NTA purification and 13.1 mg/L after refolding. For PD-1(FSY), the yield was 3.6 mg/L after Ni-NTA purification and 1.7 mg/L after refolding. For PD-L1, the yield was 34.5 mg/L after Ni-NTA purification and 15 mg/L after refolding.
Purified and refolded PD-1(WT), PD-1(Q75FSY), PD-1(D77FSY), or PD-1(A129FSY) was incubated with PD-L1(WT) or PD-L1(H69A) at the molar ratio of 1:1 in PBS buffer at 37°C for 6 h. The amount of PD-L1 was 4 μg. After incubation, 5x reduced loading buffer (CWBio, Cat# CW0027) was added into the incubation and heated at 100°C for 10 min. These samples were then separated by 15% SDS-PAGE gel followed by staining with Coomassie brilliant blue. Western blot was then performed using the primary antibody specific for the His6x tag (mAb anti-6xHis tag, abcam, Cat# ab18184, 1:1000 dilution) and the secondary antibody goat pAb anti-mouse IgG (abcam, Cat# ab97023, 1:5000 dilution). Protein bands were developed by chemiluminescence (Bio-rad, Cat# 1705062). For in vitro crosslinking kinetics, PD-1(A129FSY) was incubated with PD-L1(WT) in the same final molar concentration for different time points, and the samples were analyzed with western blot using the same procedures.
The PD-1(FSY) and PD-1(FSY)/PD-L1 crosslinked protein samples were digested with trypsin. Digested peptides were analyzed with an in-line EASY-spray source and nano-LC UltiMate 3000 high-performance liquid chromatography system (Thermo Fisher) interfaced with Elite mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher). An EASY-Spray PepMap C18 Columns (50 cm; particle size, 2 μm; pore size, 100 Å; Thermo Fisher) was used to separate peptides using gradient of 2% - 40% buffer B (80% acetonitrile, 20% H 2 O, 0.1% formic acid) at flow rate 300 nL/min. The eluted peptides were detected by the Elite mass spectrometer, which was operated in data-dependent mode with one full MS scan at R = 60,000 (m/z = 200) mass range from 375 to 1800 (AGC target 1 × 10 6 ), followed by ten CID MS/MS scans. A dynamic exclusion time of 30 s was used, and singly charged ions were excluded. Mass spectrometry raw data was searched by Maxquant.
H460 cells (5x10 5 ) and U87 cells (5x10 5 ) were seeded in 6-well plates and cultured with RPMI-1640 [+10% FBS (GIBCO, Cat# 10099-141) and 1:100 penicillin–streptomycin (GIBCO, Cat# 15140-122] or DMEM (+10% FBS and 1:100 penicillin-streptomycin), respectively. After 6 h, PD-1(WT) or PD-1(FSY) was added into culture media in final volume of 800 μL. After incubation at 37°C for 12 h, cells were dissociated with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA (GIBCO, Cat# 25200-056), collected, and lysed by adding 100 μL RIPA (Beyotime, Cat# P0013C) with 1x protease inhibitor cocktail (Cell Signaling Technology, Cat# 5872) followed by ultrasonication. Protein concentration was quantified using the BCA protein assay kit (Beyotime, Cat# P0010). The samples were then heated at 100°C for 10 min after adding 5x reduced loading buffer (CWBio, Cat# CW0027). The denatured samples were analyzed by electrophoresis in 12% SDS-PAGE followed by western blot using the primary antibody anti-human PD-L1 (abcam, Cat# ab213524; 1:1000) or anti-human PD-1 extracellular domain (ECD) (abcam, Cat# ab233117), the internal standard anti-β-actin (abcam, Cat# ab179467; 1:3000), and the secondary antibody anti-rabbit IgG (Cell Signaling Technology, Cat# 7074S; 1:3000). The protein bands were developed by chemiluminescence (Bio-rad, Cat# 1705062).
To test if PD-1(FSY) could crosslink with endogenous mouse PD-L1, thymus and spleen were separated from BALB/C mice and then grinded by syringes. The obtained cells were re-suspended in DPBS and filtered through 40 μm filter (Corning, Cat# 352340) and spun down. These single cells (1x10 6 ) were then seeded into a 6-well plate and cultured in RPMI-1640 containing 10%FBS (GIBCO, Cat# 10099-141) and 1:100 penicillin-streptomycin (GIBCO, Cat# 15140-122). PBS, PD-1(WT), or PD-1(FSY) was added into the wells to a final volume of 800 μL. After incubation for 12 h, cells were harvested for western blot analysis using procedures similar for H460 and U87 cells described above. The primary antibody was anti-mouse PD-L1 (Proteintech, Cat# 66248-1-Ig; 1:2000) and the secondary antibody was anti-mouse IgG (CST, Cat# 7076S; 1:3000). The primary anti-β-actin antibody (abcam, Cat# ab179467, 1:3000) and the secondary antibody anti-rabbit IgG (Cell Signaling Technology, Cat# 7074S, 1:3000) were used to detect β-actin as the internal standard.
All animal studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Southern Medical University. H460 or U87 cells (2x10 6 ) were resuspended with 200 μL DPBS and respectively injected into the flank of 6-8 week old male M-NSG mice (NOD-Prkdc −/− -IL2rg -/Y , Shanghai Model Organisms, China, Cat# NM-NSG-001). These immunodeficient mice lack mature endogenous mouse B cells, T cells, and NK cells, which allows human cancer cells to be efficiently engrafted and to grow into tumor. After 10 days, tumor size was about 4x4 mm 2 . PD-1(WT) or PD-1(FSY) was injected through tail vein or into the skin site near the tumor. After 3 h, mice were sacrificed and tumors were harvested. The tumors were added with 200 μL RIPA (Beyotime, Cat# P0013C) with 1x protease inhibitor cocktail (Cell Signaling Technology, Cat# 5872), split by a homogenizer (LUKACEXUYIQI, Cat# LUKYM-I), and lysed by ultrasonication. Western blot was then performed using the same procedures as described in the section above.
Fresh PBMCs were isolated from the peripheral blood of healthy donors by Ficoll (GE Healthcare, Cat# 17-5442-02) gradient centrifugation. Monocytes were enriched from PBMCs using CD14 microbeads (Miltenyi, Cat# 130-050-201). Purified CD14 + monocytes were cultured in RPMI-1640 containing 10% FBS (GIBCO, Cat# 10099-141), 1:100 penicillin-streptomycin (GIBCO, Cat# 15140-122), 100 ng/mL GM-CSF (Peprotech, Cat# 300-03), and 50 ng/mL IL-4 (Peprotech, Cat# 200-04) to induce DC differentiation. Fresh medium was added every 3 days. On day 6, 100 ng/mL TNF-α (Peprotech, Cat# 300-01A) and 3 μg/mL LPS (Sigma, Cat# L4391) were added to the medium to induce DC maturation. After 48 h, CD11c (BD PharMingen, Cat# 555392), PD-L1 (BD PharMingen, Cat# 558065), CD86 (BD Horizon, Cat# 562999), CD83 (BD PharMingen,Cat# 561132), and HLA-DR (BD PharMingen, Cat# 560652) expressed on DC were detected by flow cytometry (BD LSRFortessa).
For allogeneic DC-T cell stimulation, CD3 + T cells were enriched from allogeneic PBMCs of the healthy donors by CD3 microbeads (Miltenyi, Cat# 130-097-043). CD3 + T cells (1x10 7 ) were labeled with 2 μM CFSE (eBioscience, Cat# 65-0850-84) in 1 mL PBS for 15 min at 37°C; the labeling was stopped by adding 3 mL cold FBS and then washed with cold PBS twice.
Mature DC were seeded in 96-well round-bottom plates. PBS, PD-1, or atezolizumab (CrownBio, Cat# E4543-T1901) was added into the wells. After 2 h, the CFSE labeled T cells (1x10 5 ) were then added into the wells and co-cultured with the allogeneic DC for 5 days. At day 3, 30 μL fresh medium was replenished into every well. After 5 days, cells were collected, stained with anti-human CD3 (BD PharMingen, Cat# 561812), and examined for T cell proliferation using flow cytometry and gating for CD3 + T cells. Culture supernatants were harvested to measure IFN-γ concentration using an ELISA kit (Invitrogen, Cat# 88-7316-76). Flow cytometry data were analyzed with software Flowjo_V10.
On day −10, fresh PBMC were activated with 3 μg/mL anti-CD3 antibody (BD pharmingen, Cat# 555329) coated in the 12-well flat plate and 1 μg/mL anti-CD28 antibody (BD pharmingen,Cat# 555725) and cultured in RPMI-1640 containing 10% FBS, 1:100 penicillin-streptomycin (GIBCO, Cat# 15140-122), 100 IU/mL IL-2 (PeproTech, Cat# AF-200-02-500), and 2 mM glutamine (GIBCO, Cat# 25030-081). On day −7, 5x10 5 H460 cells were seeded into the 6-well plate. After 6 h, H460 cells were treated with mitomycin C (10 μg/mL) for 2 h and then washed with PBS twice. To these H460 cells were then added activated PBMC (5x10 6 ) to co-culture (PBMC:H460 = 10:1). PBMC were collected every 2 days and re-cultured with H460 cells treated with mitomycin C (10 μg/mL). After co-culturing for 3 times, PBMC were harvested and mixed with fresh H460 cells at the ratio of 1:4 (H460 = 2x10 6 , PBMC = 5x10 5 ). The cell mixture was injected into the flank of the 6-8 week old male M-NSG mice (NOD-Prkdc −/− -IL2rg -/Y , Shanghai Model Organisms, China, Cat# NM-NSG-001). PBS, 22 μg PD-1(WT), 22 μg PD-1(FSY), or 200 μg atezolizumab was administered through tail intravenous injection after 3 h and every 6 days (on day 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42). 11 μg PD-1(FSY) or 100 μg atezolizumab was administered through tail intravenous injection after 3 h and every 3 days (on day 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42). Tumor growth was measured with calipers in two dimensions, and tumor volume was calculated using the formula: tumor volume = length x width 2 /2. At day 44, tumor length was close to 15 mm, and mice were sacrificed for analyses.
To construct the chimeric antigen receptor expression plasmid pLenti-EF1a-ScFv EphA2-4-1BB-CD3zeta, DNA of EphA2-specific scFv derived from the EphA2 monoclonal antibody (mAb) 4H5 was cloned into a lenti-viral backbone containing the EF-1a promoter, the human CD8α hinge and trans-membrane domain, 4-1BB co-stimulatory domain, and the CD3ζ-chain ( Li et al., 2018b; Shi et al., 2018; Yi et al., 2018; Chow et al., 2013 5.

To prepare lenti-virus for transducing human T cells, 293FT cells were seeded in 15 cm cell dish cultured with DMEM containing 10% FBS (without antibiotics) at the confluency of 50%. About 24 h later, cells grew to 90% confluency. Ten μg core plasmid (pLenti-EF1a-ScFv EphA2-4-1BB-CD3zeta), 10 μg pMD2.G, and 15 μg psPAX2 were added into 1 mL Opti-MEM (GIBCO, Cat# 31985088), followed with addition of 105 μL polyetherimide (Sigma, Cat# GF70215825) (1 μg/mL). The mixture was vortexed for 20 s and protected from light for 15 min. The mixture was then added into 293FT cell dish and mixed well. After 12 h, cell medium was replaced with fresh DMEM containing 10%FBS (without antibiotics). After 48 h, supernatant containing lenti-virus was harvested and centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 10 min to remove cell debris. The supernatant was transferred into new tubes and Lenti-X™ concentrator (Takara, Cat# 631232) was added and mixed gently. After keeping at 4°C overnight, the supernatant was centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 30 min at 4°C to obtain lenti-viral particles. The lenti-viral particles were resuspended with RPMI-1640 (without FBS) and frozen at −80°C for T cells infection later. Prior to use, the viral titer was measured using a qPCR Lentivirus Complete Titration Kit (abm, Cat# LV900-iC) on T cells to determine the MOI.
T cells were enriched from healthy donor’s PBMC using CD3 microbeads (Miltenyi, Cat# 130-097-043) and activated with 3 μg/mL coated anti-CD3 antibody (BD pharmingen, Cat# 555329) and 1 μg/mL anti-CD28 (BD pharmingen, Cat# 555725) antibody in RPMI-1640 containing 10% FBS, 1:100 penicillin-streptomycin (GIBCO, Cat# 15140-122), 100 IU/mL IL-2 (PeproTech, Cat# AF-200-02-500) and 2 mM glutamine (GIBCO, Cat# 25030-081). After activation for 48 h, 1x10 6 T cells were seeded into a 24-well plate and 8 μg/mL polybrene (EMO Millipore, Cat# TR-1003-G) was added. Lentivirus was added into the wells in MOI of 50, and the final volume of medium was 500 μL. After 12 h of infection, the media was replaced with fresh RPMI-1640 containing 10%FBS, 1:100 penicillin-streptomycin (GIBCO, Cat# 15140-122), 100 IU/mL IL-2 (PeproTech, Cat# AF-200-02-500), and 2 mM glutamine (GIBCO, Cat# 25030-081). A second transduction was performed after 12 h. Seven days post lentiviral transduction, T cells were harvested to detect the transduction efficiency by staining with Biotinylated-Protein L (the primary antibody, ThermoFisher, Cat# 29997) followed with PE-Cy5 Streptavidin (the second antibody, BD PharMingen, Cat# 554062) and anti-human CD3 (BD Horizon, Cat# 561812) and analyzing with flow cytometry (BD LSRFortessa).
Expression of PD-L1 and EphA2 on H460 cells or U87 cells was detected by staining with anti-human EphA2 (Biolegend, Cat# 356804) and anti-human PD-L1 (BD pharmingen, Cat# 558065) followed with flow cytometry (BD LSRFortessa). H460 cells or U87 cells (2x10 4 ) were seeded into a 96-well flat plate. Into the wells were then added 1x10 5 CAR-EphA T cells. The final volume of medium RPMI-1640 containing 10% FBS, 1:100 penicillin-streptomycin (GIBCO, Cat# 15140-122), 2 mM glutamine (GIBCO, Cat# 25030-081) but without IL-2 was 200 μL. After 16 h, CAR-EphA2 T cells or CAR-EphA2 T cells co-culturing with H460 or U87 cells were harvested and used to examine the expression of PD-1 (BD PharMingen, Cat# 560795) by flow cytometry. Similarly, 2x10 4 H460 cells or U87 cells were seeded in to a 96-well flat plate. After 6 h, PD-1 or atezolizumab was added into the wells. Then 1x10 5 CAR-EphA2 T cells or non-transduced T cells were seeded into the wells and final volume was 200 μL. After 12 h co-culturing, T cells were harvested to detect the expression of CD69 (BD PharMingen, Cat# 557745), a marker of T cells activation, by flow cytometry. The flow cytometry data were analyzed with Flowjo_V10.
H460 cells (2x10 6 ) were suspended in 200 μL DPBS and injected into the flank of the 6-8 week old male M-NSG mice (NOD-Prkdc −/− -IL2rg -/Y , Shanghai Model Organisms, China, Cat# NM-NSG-001). After 14 days, tumor size was about 5x5 mm 2 . CAR-EphA2 T cells (1x10 7 ) mixed with 22 μg PD-1 or 200 μg atezolizumab were then injected through tail vein (day 0). PD-1 or atezolizumab was administrated every 4 days (day 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20). On day 8, 1x10 7 CAR-Epha2 T cells were administrated for the second time. On day 24, mice were sacrificed for analyses.
The harvested tumor tissues were cut into 1-2 mm patches and dissociated by adding 300 μL tissue digestive enzyme solution [100 Kunitz units of DNaseI (STEM CELL, Cat# 07900), 8 Wunsch units of Liberase™ TM (Sigma, Cat# LIBTM-RO) (8 U/mL) and Liberase™ TH (Sigma, Cat# LIBTH-RO) (8 U/mL) in medium 199 (GIBCO, Cat# 11150) with 20 mM HEPES (GIBCO, Cat# 15630)]. After shaking at 37°C and 150 rpm for 1 h, the digestion was stopped by adding 3 mL cold RPMI-1640 containing 10% FBS. Subsequently, the digested cell suspension was filtered through 40 μm filter (Corning, Cat# 352340) and spun down. Supernatant was aspirated and the cells were resuspended in PBS with anti-human CD3 (BD Horizon, Cat# 561812), anti-human CD8 (BD pharmingen, Cat# 555634), anti-human CD69 (BD pharmingen, Cat# 557745) and Fixable Viability stain 620 (cell vitality dye, BD Horizon, Cat# 564996) and incubated at RT protected from light for 30 min. The cells were then washed with PBS twice, and subjected to flow cytometry (BD LSRFortessa) for detection of tumor infiltrating T cells. The flow cytometry data was analyzed with Flowjo_V10.
To extract the total RNA from the tumor tissue patches, each tumor sample was added 500 μL Trizol (TaKaRa, Cat# 9109) and then split by a homogenizer (LUKACEXUYIQI, Cat# LUKYM-I). Total RNA (1 μg) of each sample were reverse transcribed using RT reagent kit (TaKaRa, Cat# RR047A). The cDNA was diluted to one tenth with sterile water. Two μL of diluted cDNA was used for each qPCR reaction using TB Green Premix (TaKaRa, Cat#RR820A) with a Quantstudio 7Flex (appliedbiosystems). The relative mRNA level of each target gene was calculated using the following equation: mRNA level of gene X relative to CD3 = 2 -ΔΔCT , wherein ΔΔCT = (CT value of gene X in drug group - CT value of CD3 in drug group) - (CT value of gene X in PBS group – CT value of CD3 in PBS group). Primers for qRT-PCR are listed in Table S1 with names starting with q.
Hu-mice were generated as previously described ( Lan et al., 2006; Rong et al., 2014; Jin et al., 2019 13. Jin, C.-H. ∙ Xia, J. ∙ Rafiq, S. ...

An effective approach to prevent immune rejection of human ESC-derived allografts Cell Stem Cell. 2014; 14 :121-130 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (202) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, the NSG mice were first treated with sublethal irradiation (2 Gy), and human fetal thymus (1 mm 3 ) was transplanted under the kidney capsule of the irradiated NSG mice. The human CD34 + hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) were simultaneously purified from the same human fetal liver using a MACS separation system with anti-human CD34 + antibody (Miltenyi, Cat# 130-046-702), and 1x10 5 to 5x10 5 human CD34 + HSCs were intravenously transfused into the same mice. After about 12 weeks, peripheral blood (about 30 μL) of Hu-mice was collected to examine whether human CD3 + T cells (BD PharMingen, Cat# 561812), CD19 + B cells (BD PharMingen, Cat# 561295) were re-constructed by flow cytometry.
After confirming the reconstruction of human T cells and B cells in Hu-mice, 2x10 6 H460 cells re-suspended in DPBS were injected into the skin flank of the Hu-mice. After 2 days, these H460 tumor-loaded Hu-mice were randomized into five cohorts, into which PBS, 22 μg PD1(WT), 22 μg PD1(FSY), 200 μg PD1(FSY), or 200 μg atezolizumab was administrated through tail vein on day 0 and every four days. The tumor volume was measured every four days using caliper and calculated using the formula: tumor volume = length x width 2 /2. On day 21, Hu-mice were sacrificed and tumors were collected for analyses.
Z HER2:342 corresponding affibody gene fragment was codon optimized for E. coli expression and synthesized by GENEWIZ (GTGGATAACAAATTTAACAAAGAAATGCGCAACGCGTATTGGGAAATTGCGCTGCTGCCGAACCTGAACAACCAGCAGAAACGCGCGTTTATTCGCAGCCTGTATGATGATCCGAGCCAGAGCGCGAACCTGCTGGCGGAAGCGAAAAAACTGAACGATGCGCAGGCGCCGAAA). Primers (WT NdeI For and WT HindIII Rev) were used to PCR amplify the WT affibody synthetic gene fragment by Q5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerases (NEB, Cat# M0491). The PCR product was digested with NdeI-HF and HindIII-HF and ligated into the same restriction enzyme digested pBAD vector using T4 DNA ligase (NEB, Cat# M0202L)
To introduce the TAG codon at sites D36 or D37, two pairs of primers (D36-F with D36-R, D37-F with D37-R) were separately used to perform Q5® Site-Directed Mutagenesis(NEB, E0554S) and using plasmid pBAD-Z HER2:342 (WT) as the template.
To clone the dimeric Z HER2:342 (dZ HER2:342 ) into pBAD vector, two separate PCRs were performed with pBAD-Z HER2:342 (WT) as the template and the following primers: dZ HER2 -F1-F with dZ HER2 -F1-R, and dZ HER2 -F2-F with dZ HER2 -F2-R. PCR product one and two were cloned together into NdeI-HF and HindIII-HF digested vector using ClonExpress II One Step Cloning Kit(Vazyme, C112). For mutants dZ HER2:342 (D36TAG) and dZ HER2:342 (D37TAG), a similar method was used with the same primers and Z HER2:342 (D36TAG) or Z HER2:342 (D37TAG) as a template respectively.
Plasmids pBAD-dZ HER2:342 (WT), pBAD-dZ HER2:342 (D36TAG) or pBAD- dZ HER2:342 (D37TAG) were separately transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) electro-competent cells. Plasmid pBAD-dZ HER2:342 (D36TAG) or pBAD-dZ HER2:342 (D37TAG) was co-transform with plasmid pEvol-FSYRS ( Wang et al., 2018 46. Wang, N. ∙ Yang, B. ∙ Fu, C. ... Genetically Encoding Fluorosulfate-l-tyrosine To React with Lysine, Histidine, and Tyrosine via SuFEx in Proteins in Vivo J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2018; 140 :4995-4999 Crossref Scopus (150) PubMed Google Scholar ) into E. coli BL21(DE3) electro-competent cells. For expression of pBAD-dZ HER2:342 (WT), transformed bacteria were cultured at 37°C in 2xYT media with 100 μg/mL ampicillin and induced with 0.2% arabinose when OD 600 reached 0.6. For incorporation of FSY into proteins, transformed bacteria were cultured at 37°C in 2xYT media with 100 μg/mL ampicillin and 34 μg/mL chloramphenicol and induced with 0.2% arabinose, and 1mM FSY when OD 600 reached 0.6. After induction of expression at 18 °C for 12 h, bacteria were collected by centrifugation at 7000 rpm for 5 min at 4°C. The cell pellets were re-suspended in 10 mL lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 30 mM Imidazole, 1% Tween 20, 10% glycerol, lysozyme 1 mg/mL, DNase 0.1mg/mL, and protease inhibitors). The cell suspension was lysed at 4°C for 30 min by shaking, and subsequently sonicated with Sonic Dismembrator (Fisher Scientific, 30% output, 3 min, 1 s off, 1 s on) in an ice-water bath. The cell lysate was then centrifugated at 30,000 g for 30 min at 4°C. Appropriate volume of TALON metal affinity resin (Takara Bio USA Inc, Cat# 635501) were added into the supernatant and incubated at 4°C for 2 h by shaking. The mixture was loaded in a column and washed with wash buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, 10% glycerol) in 10 column volume. The protein was eluted with elution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 350 mM imidazole, 10% glycerol). The proteins were concentrated and buffer exchanged into 100 μL of protein storage buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 8.0, and 150 mM NaCl) using Amicon Ultra columns, and stored at −80°C. Protein concentration was measured by nanodrop (Thermo Fisher) based on its molecular weight and extinction coefficient. For dZ HER2:342 , molecular weight is 14.6 kDa and extinction coefficient is 16960 M -1 cm -1 .
Recombinant extra-cellular domain (ECD) of HER2 receptor was purchased from Abcam (Cat# ab168896). Purified 3 μM dZ HER2:342 (WT), dZ HER2:342 (36FSY), or dZ HER2:342 (37FSY) was incubated with 500 nM HER2 ECD in 20 uL 50 mM Tris-HCl, 8.0 at 37°C for 16 h. After incubation, 4x Laemmli Sample Buffer (Bio Rad, Cat# 161-0747) was added into the incubation and heated at 95°C for 10 min. The samples were separated on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with 1:10000 anti-his monoclonal antibody (Proteintech #HRP-66005). For in vitro crosslinking kinetics, dZ HER2:342 (37FSY) was incubated with the HER2 ECD in the same final molar concentration, and the samples were analyzed using the same procedures at different time points of incubation.
SKBR3 cells (5x10 5 ) were seeded in 6-well plates and cultured with McCoy’s 5A +10% FBS (ATCC 30-2007). After 12 h, 1 μM dZ HER2:342 (WT) or dZ HER2:342 (FSY) was added into culture media in final volume of 500 μL. After incubation at 37°C for 4 h, cells were dissociated with enzyme-free dissociation buffer (GIBCO, Cat# 13151014), collected, and lysed by adding 100 μL Pierce RIPA Buffer (Thermo Scientific, Cat# 89900) with 1x protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Cat# 11836153001) followed by ultrasonication. The samples were then heated at 95°C for 10 min after adding 4x Laemmli Sample Buffer (Bio Rad, Cat# 161-0747). The samples were separated on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with 1:10000 anti-his monoclonal antibody (Proteintech, Cat# HRP-66005). The internal standard β-actin was probed with 1:500 β-Actin Antibody (C4) (Santa-cruz, Cat# sc-47778 HRP). To determine the percentage of HER2 receptor crosslinked by dZ HER2:342 (37FSY), 1.0 μM of dZ HER2:342 (37FSY) or dZ HER2:342 (WT) was similarly incubated with the SKBR3 cells for 2, 4, and 8 h. The samples were similarly processed except the primary antibody used was the anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody (1:5000, Abcam, Cat# ab27086) followed by anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:5000, Santa Cruz, Cat# sc-2357).
Statistical analyses on CFSE proliferation assay, CD69 expression, T cells infiltration in tumor tissue (flow cytometric data), ELISA data, and tumor weight data were compared by one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test using Prism 6.0 (GraphPad software). Tumor growth data were compared by two-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test using Prism6.0 (GraphPad software). All the P value s were calculated using GraphPad PRISM 6.0 with the following significance: n.s. p > 0.05; ∗ p < 0.05; ∗∗ p < 0.01; ∗∗∗ p < 0.001; ∗∗∗∗ p < 0.0001. Statistical details for each experiment can be found in the figures and the legends.
