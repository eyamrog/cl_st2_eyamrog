Title: Extracellular pH sensing by plant cell-surface peptide-receptor complexes


Abstract: Summary

The extracellular pH is a vital regulator of various biological processes in plants. However, how plants perceive extracellular pH remains obscure. Here, we report that plant cell-surface peptide-receptor complexes can function as extracellular pH sensors. We found that pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) dramatically alkalinizes the acidic extracellular pH in root apical meristem (RAM) region, which is essential for root meristem growth factor 1 (RGF1)-mediated RAM growth. The extracellular alkalinization progressively inhibits the acidic-dependent interaction between RGF1 and its receptors (RGFRs) through the pH sensor sulfotyrosine. Conversely, extracellular alkalinization promotes the alkaline-dependent binding of plant elicitor peptides (Peps) to its receptors (PEPRs) through the pH sensor Glu/Asp, thereby promoting immunity. A domain swap between RGFR and PEPR switches the pH dependency of RAM growth. Thus, our results reveal a mechanism of extracellular pH sensing by plant peptide-receptor complexes and provide insights into the extracellular pH-mediated regulation of growth and immunity in the RAM.

Section: Introduction

The extracellular pH is a critical factor for numerous chemical reactions and biological processes in many forms of life ( Tsai and Schmidt, 2021 83. Tsai, H.H. ∙ Schmidt, W. The enigma of environmental pH sensing in plants Nat. Plants. 2021; 7 :106-115 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ). The extracellular space inside plants, called the apoplast, is an interconnected compartment containing a thin film of water ( Geilfus, 2017 24. Geilfus, C.M. The pH of the apoplast: dynamic factor with functional impact under stress Mol. Plant. 2017; 10 :1371-1386 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (129) PubMed Google Scholar ), which is essential for nutrient uptake, cell-to-cell communication, and plant-microbe interactions ( Aung et al., 2018 3.

The plant extracellular pH is naturally acidic but changes dynamically in response to both environmental cues and physiological conditions ( Boller and Felix, 2009 7. Boller, T. ∙ Felix, G.

Externally, weather, climate, and fertilizer can change the soil pH, resulting in an alteration of apoplastic pH ( Tsai and Schmidt, 2021 83. Tsai, H.H. ∙ Schmidt, W. The enigma of environmental pH sensing in plants Nat. Plants. 2021; 7 :106-115 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ), although internally, the apoplastic pH is also affected by growth and defense processes ( Barbez et al., 2017 5. Barbez, E. ∙ Dünser, K. ∙ Gaidora, A. ... Auxin steers root cell expansion via apoplastic pH regulation in Arabidopsis thaliana Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The “acid growth theory” states that auxin triggers the activation of proton pumps, resulting in the acidification of the apoplast to promote cell expansion ( Rayle and Cleland, 1992 70. Rayle, D.L. ∙ Cleland, R.E. The acid growth theory of auxin-induced cell elongation is alive and well Plant Physiol. 1992; 99 :1271-1274 Crossref Scopus (673) PubMed Google Scholar ). Recent studies reveal that transmembrane kinase1 (TMK1) phosphorylates and activates plasma membrane H + -ATPases, resulting in apoplastic acidification, thereby mediating the auxin signal to promote cell elongation in the hypocotyl and root elongation zones ( Li et al., 2021 44.

Conversely, the extracellular alkalinization is a hallmark of plant defense responses ( Boller and Felix, 2009 7. Boller, T. ∙ Felix, G.

It has also been reported as an early response to salinity or drought ( Bacon et al., 1998 4.

The increase in systemic pH arises from the movement of ions or the secondary regulation of proton pumps ( Elmore and Coaker, 2011 17. Elmore, J.M. ∙ Coaker, G.

Although the extracellular pH is critical and its dynamic change is ubiquitous, little is known about how extracellular pH is perceived by plants.
Small peptides are important extracellular signals for cell-to-cell communication in plants, as they have been found to be as important as small-molecule phytohormones in regulating plant growth, development, and defense ( Matsubayashi, 2014 48. Matsubayashi, Y. Posttranslationally modified small-peptide signals in plants Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2014; 65 :385-413 Crossref Scopus (257) PubMed Google Scholar ; Matsubayashi and Sakagami, 2006 50. Matsubayashi, Y. ∙ Sakagami, Y. Peptide hormones in plants Annu. Rev.

Plant peptide hormone signalling Essays Biochem. 2015; 58 :115-131 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Host- and microbe-derived small peptides such as CLAVATA3/ESR-RELATED (CLE), root meristem growth factor (RGF), plant elicitor peptide (Pep), epitopes of flagellin (flg22), and elongation factor Tu (elf18) are recognized by cell-surface receptor-like kinases (RLKs) ( Couto and Zipfel, 2016 12.

Matsubayashi, Y. Posttranslationally modified small-peptide signals in plants Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2014; 65 :385-413 Crossref Scopus (257) PubMed Google Scholar ). Structural studies have revealed a conserved mechanism for the small linear peptides to activate their receptors ( Hohmann et al., 2017 32. Hohmann, U. ∙ Lau, K. ∙ Hothorn, M.

Receptor kinases in plant-pathogen interactions: more than pattern recognition Plant Cell. 2017; 29 :618-637 Crossref Scopus (503) PubMed Google Scholar ). It can be exemplified by RGF1 and Pep1 that small peptides bind to the extracellular domain of their cognate receptors, inducing the receptor dimerization with co-receptors. Subsequently, the peptide signal is transduced from the extracellular space to initiate downstream signaling ( Ou et al., 2016 66. Ou, Y. ∙ Lu, X. ∙ Zi, Q. ...

The RGF/GLV/CLEL (hereafter referred to as RGF) peptides are a small family of nine sulfated peptide members involved in the regulation of multiple biological processes, including meristem growth, gravitropic response, lateral root development, and immune response ( Fernandez et al., 2020 22.

RGF peptides require tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase (TPST)-mediated posttranslational modification to achieve their bioactivity ( Matsuzaki et al., 2010 51.

The mature RGFs are secreted into the apoplast to activate their receptors RGFRs/RGF1 INSENSITIVE 1 to 5 (RGIs) and co-receptors SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS RECEPTOR KINASE (SERKs) ( Ou et al., 2016 66.

The root master regulators, PLETHORAs (PLTs), are the downstream targets of RGF1 signaling ( Aida et al., 2004 2. Aida, M. ∙ Beis, D. ∙ Heidstra, R. ...

The PLTs are mobile proteins, and their protein gradients in the RAM are essential for maintaining root meristematic activity ( Galinha et al., 2007 23. Galinha, C. ∙ Hofhuis, H. ∙ Luijten, M. ...

The Peps are a small family of immune peptides that trigger immune responses, including the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), Ca 2+ influx, extracellular alkalinization, defense gene expression, and the inhibition of root growth ( Bartels and Boller, 2015 6. Bartels, S. ∙ Boller, T. Quo vadis, Pep? Plant elicitor peptides at the crossroads of immunity, stress, and development J. Exp.

USA. 2006; 103 :10104-10109 Crossref Scopus (325) PubMed Google Scholar ). Unlike pathogen-derived pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), such as flg22 and elf18, Peps are host-derived immune peptides called damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) ( Bartels and Boller, 2015 6. Bartels, S. ∙ Boller, T. Quo vadis, Pep? Plant elicitor peptides at the crossroads of immunity, stress, and development J. Exp. Bot. 2015; 66 :5183-5193 Crossref Scopus (111) PubMed Google Scholar ). In Arabidopsis thaliana , Peps are identified as an endogenous defense signal to amplify the immune response ( Huffaker et al., 2006 33. Huffaker, A. ∙ Pearce, G. ∙ Ryan, C.A.

PEPR2 is a second receptor for the Pep1 and Pep2 peptides and contributes to defense responses in Arabidopsis Plant Cell. 2010; 22 :508-522 Crossref Scopus (373) PubMed Google Scholar ), Peps trigger a much stronger immune response than flg22 and elf18, particularly in the roots ( Jing et al., 2019 38.

Peps are matured through metacaspase cleavage and released into the extracellular space to activate the PEPRs and their co-receptor SERK3/ BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1-associated kinase1 (BAK1) ( Hander et al., 2019 29.

In this study, we report that the extracellular pH can be sensed by peptide receptors in the RAM. Using molecular, biochemical, and genetic analyses, we found that the extracellular acidic pH environment in the RAM is altered by the immunity-triggered extracellular alkalinization. The extracellular pH change can be sensed by RGF1 and Pep1 receptor complexes. The alkalinization attenuates the relatively acidic pH-dependent RGF1-RGFR interaction to inhibit RGF1 signaling and the proliferation of RAM. The alkalinization enhances the relatively alkaline pH-dependent Pep1-PEPR interaction to promote immune response. The key pH-sensing residues in RGF1 and PEPR1 are identified as sulfotyrosine and Glu/Asp, respectively. Swapping the extracellular domains of RGI1/RGFR4 and PEPR1 can switch the pH dependency of RAM development. Thus, our findings uncover how plants sense extracellular pH signals in the RAM to fine-tune growth and immunity.

Here, we used the nontoxic, pH-sensitive fluorescent dye 8-hydroxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid trisodium salt (HPTS) ( Barbez et al., 2017 5. Barbez, E. ∙ Dünser, K. ∙ Gaidora, A. ... Auxin steers root cell expansion via apoplastic pH regulation in Arabidopsis thaliana Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :E4884-E4893 Crossref Scopus (228) PubMed Google Scholar ) to visualize the immune-signal-induced alkalinization in situ . The image analysis of wild-type (Col-0) Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings grown on standard MS media (pH 5.7) revealed a relatively acidic apoplast pH environment in the RAM, with the lowest pH around the region of the quiescent center (QC) ( Figures 1 A and S1 A). When the seedlings were transiently treated with the DAMP molecule Pep1, the extracellular pH surrounding the RAM, especially near the QC, significantly increased ( Figures 1 B and 1C). Treatments using the PAMP molecules (flg22 and elf18) showed similar results to the Pep1 treatment, albeit to a lesser extent ( Figures 1 D and 1E). We then tested Pep1, flg22, and elf18 treatments in the Pep1 receptor mutant pepr1 pepr2 ( pepr1/2 ). Pep1 was unable to induce RAM alkalinization in pepr1/2 ( Figures 1 F and 1G), suggesting that the extracellular alkalinization requires PEPR1/2-mediated signaling. The flg22 and elf18 treatments could not induce RAM alkalinization in pepr1/2 either ( Figures 1 F and 1G), suggesting that flg22- and elf18-induced alkalinization in the RAM depends on Pep signaling. This result is consistent with the finding that Pep signaling is required for the flg22- and elf18-induced immune response ( Ma et al., 2012 47. Ma, Y. ∙ Walker, R.K. ∙ Zhao, Y. ...

In addition, a rhizosphere-associated pathogenic Pseudomonas could also trigger apoplastic alkalinization in the RAM ( Figures S1 B–S1E) ( Ma et al., 2021 46. Ma, K.W. ∙ Niu, Y. ∙ Jia, Y. ... Coordination of microbe-host homeostasis by crosstalk with plant innate immunity Nat. Plants. 2021; 7 :814-825 Crossref Scopus (88) PubMed Google Scholar ).
It was previously reported that Pep1 treatment induces root growth inhibition ( Figures S2 A and S2B) through various mechanisms (e.g., auxin, salicylic acid signaling, and jasmonic acid signaling) ( Jing et al., 2019 38. Jing, Y. ∙ Zheng, X. ∙ Zhang, D. ... Danger-associated peptides interact with PIN-dependent local auxin distribution to inhibit root growth in Arabidopsis Plant Cell. 2019; 31 :1767-1787 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ; Poncini et al., 2017 67.

Our histological analysis showed that Pep1 treatment not only inhibited cell growth in differentiation zone ( Figures S2 C and S2D) but also significantly inhibited root meristem size ( Figures 2 A, 2B, and S2 E). Given that RGF1 signaling is critical for RAM growth and that the RAM-inhibition phenotype resembles that of the RGF1 signaling-deficient mutants ( Matsuzaki et al., 2010 51. Matsuzaki, Y. ∙ Ogawa-Ohnishi, M. ∙ Mori, A. ...

Shinohara, H. ∙ Mori, A. ∙ Yasue, N. ... Identification of three LRR-RKs involved in perception of root meristem growth factor in Arabidopsis Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Signature motif-guided identification of receptors for peptide hormones essential for root meristem growth Cell Res. 2016; 26 :674-685 Crossref Scopus (135) PubMed Google Scholar ), we speculated that Pep1 treatment might modulate RGF1 signaling. To test this hypothesis, we examined the expression of the RGF1-activated downstream marker genes PLT1 and PLT2 . The fluorescent imaging showed that the Pep1 treatment induced a significant downregulation of the PLT1-YFP and PLT2-YFP fusion genes driven by their own promoters in the roots of Col-0 seedlings ( Figures 2 C–2E), suggesting that Pep1 decreases the effect of RGF1-induced RAM growth. We then performed experiments of co-treatment with RGF1 and Pep1 in rgf1 rgf2 rgf3 , a mutant with deficiency in the endogenous RGF1 signaling in the RAM ( Matsuzaki et al., 2010 51. Matsuzaki, Y. ∙ Ogawa-Ohnishi, M. ∙ Mori, A. ... Secreted peptide signals required for maintenance of root stem cell niche in Arabidopsis Science. 2010; 329 :1065-1067 Crossref Scopus (363) PubMed Google Scholar ), and found that Pep1 inhibited the RGF1-induced promotion of RAM growth ( Figures 2 F and 2G). Notably, Pep1 induced little inhibition of root meristem size in rgf1 rgf2 rgf3 ( Figures 2 F and 2G). To further confirm this result, we tested Pep1 treatment on the RGF1 receptor quadruple mutant rgi1,2,3,4 ( Ou et al., 2016 66. Ou, Y. ∙ Lu, X. ∙ Zi, Q. ... RGF1 INSENSITIVE 1 to 5, a group of LRR receptor-like kinases, are essential for the perception of root meristem growth factor 1 in Arabidopsis thaliana Cell Res. 2016; 26 :686-698 Crossref Scopus (135) PubMed Google Scholar ). As expected, Pep1-induced RAM growth inhibition was neither detected in rgi1,2,3,4 ( Figures 2 H and 2I), although the Pep1-induced RAM alkalinization was still evident in this mutant ( Figures S2 F and S2G). Thus, our results support the hypothesis that Pep1-triggered signaling inhibits RGF1-mediated RAM growth. Nevertheless, the Pep1 treatment still induced a defect in the root transition zone (TZ) of rgi1,2,3,4 ( Figure S2 H), which is consistent with the previous report that Pep1 affects the translocation and expression of the auxin efflux carrier PINs in the TZ to inhibit root growth ( Jing et al., 2019 38. Jing, Y. ∙ Zheng, X. ∙ Zhang, D. ... Danger-associated peptides interact with PIN-dependent local auxin distribution to inhibit root growth in Arabidopsis Plant Cell. 2019; 31 :1767-1787 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ) and suggests that Pep1 induces the inhibition of the RAM and TZ through differing mechanisms.
Given that the region of Pep1-induced extracellular alkalinization in the RAM ( Figure 1 B) overlaps with the expression region of RGF1/2/3 and the PLT1/2 ( Figure S3 A) ( Galinha et al., 2007 23. Galinha, C. ∙ Hofhuis, H. ∙ Luijten, M. ... PLETHORA proteins as dose-dependent master regulators of Arabidopsis root development Nature. 2007; 449 :1053-1057 Crossref Scopus (666) PubMed Google Scholar ; Matsuzaki et al., 2010 51. Matsuzaki, Y. ∙ Ogawa-Ohnishi, M. ∙ Mori, A. ... Secreted peptide signals required for maintenance of root stem cell niche in Arabidopsis Science. 2010; 329 :1065-1067 Crossref Scopus (363) PubMed Google Scholar ), we assessed whether extracellular alkalinization per se could induce the inhibition of RGF1 signaling and RAM growth. The proton pump activator fusicoccin (FC) and the pump inhibitor N, N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) were used to introduce cell autonomous pH changes. Consistent with their modes of action, the HPTS image analysis revealed that FC and DCCD triggered the apoplastic acidification and alkalinization in the RAM, respectively ( Figures 3 A and 3B). No difference in RAM size was observed between the FC-treated and mock-treated Col-0 seedlings ( Figures S3 B and S3C), suggesting that further acidification has little effect on RAM growth, consistent with the acidic nature of its apoplast. By contrast, the DCCD treatment greatly impaired RAM size and the responsiveness to RGF1 in Col-0 ( Figures S3 B and S3C) and in aqc1-1 ( Figures 3 C and 3D), a loss-of-function mutant lacking TPST that exhibits enhanced sensitivity to exogenous RGF1 treatment ( Matsuzaki et al., 2010 51. Matsuzaki, Y. ∙ Ogawa-Ohnishi, M. ∙ Mori, A. ... Secreted peptide signals required for maintenance of root stem cell niche in Arabidopsis Science. 2010; 329 :1065-1067 Crossref Scopus (363) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhou et al., 2010 93. Zhou, W. ∙ Wei, L. ∙ Xu, J. ... Arabidopsis tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase acts in the auxin/ PLETHORA pathway in regulating postembryonic maintenance of the root stem cell niche Plant Cell. 2010; 22 :3692-3709 Crossref Scopus (145) PubMed Google Scholar ). Interestingly, DCCD did not have an effect on RAM growth in aqc1-1 without exogenous RGF1 treatment ( Figures 3 C and 3D). Together, these data indicate that extracellular alkalinization triggered by a proton pump inhibitor is sufficient to inhibit RGF1-induced RAM growth.
We next investigated the pH response of RGF1 signaling using different medium pH conditions. Consistent with the FC and DCCD treatments, the medium pH conditions markedly induced apoplastic pH change ( Figures S3 D and S3E). Not considering the potential buffering capacity of the root apoplast, we conducted a HPTS calibration using Col-0 seedlings grown on different medium pH conditions and approximately estimated that the pH value near the QC region was less than 4.7 ( Figures S3 D and S3F). To maximize the effect of exogenous RGF1 peptide application in different pH conditions, the aqc1-1 mutant that possesses little basal RGF1 bioactivity was used ( Zhou et al., 2010 93. Zhou, W. ∙ Wei, L. ∙ Xu, J. ... Arabidopsis tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase acts in the auxin/ PLETHORA pathway in regulating postembryonic maintenance of the root stem cell niche Plant Cell. 2010; 22 :3692-3709 Crossref Scopus (145) PubMed Google Scholar ). The RGF1-induced RAM growth in aqc1-1 was significantly inhibited at pH 6.7 and 7.2 ( Figures 3 E and 3F). The imaging of PLT2-YFP fluorescence in aqc1-1 also showed that the RGF1-induced expression of PLT2 was notably attenuated at pH 6.7 and 7.2 relative to pH 4.7 and 5.7 ( Figures 3 G and 3H and S3 G). The pH effect on Col-0 plants was consistent with that of aqc1-1 mutant ( Figures S3 H and S3I). These results suggest that RGF1 signaling is substantially impaired when the pH of the growth medium is increased from 5.7 to 6.7 or 7.2.
We further monitored the pH effects on the RGF1 receptor quadruple mutant rgi1,2,3,4 . The FC or DCCD treatment and different pH conditions were unable to induce inhibition of RAM size in rgi1,2,3,4 ( Figures 3 I–3L). Together with the finding that DCCD had no effect on RAM size in aqc1-1 , these results suggest that alkalinization-induced RAM growth inhibition is mainly achieved through RGF1 signaling and that RAM growth becomes largely independent of pH without an intact RGF1 signaling pathway.
We next explored how extracellular alkalinization inhibited RGF1 signaling. RGFs are secreted peptide signals that are perceived by the cell-surface receptors RGFRs and co-receptors SERKs ( Ou et al., 2016 66. Ou, Y. ∙ Lu, X. ∙ Zi, Q. ... RGF1 INSENSITIVE 1 to 5, a group of LRR receptor-like kinases, are essential for the perception of root meristem growth factor 1 in Arabidopsis thaliana Cell Res. 2016; 26 :686-698 Crossref Scopus (135) PubMed Google Scholar ; Shinohara et al., 2016 73. Shinohara, H. ∙ Mori, A. ∙ Yasue, N. ... Identification of three LRR-RKs involved in perception of root meristem growth factor in Arabidopsis Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Signature motif-guided identification of receptors for peptide hormones essential for root meristem growth Cell Res. 2016; 26 :674-685 Crossref Scopus (135) PubMed Google Scholar ). The RGF-induced heterodimerization of the extracellular leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains of the RGFRs and SERKs leads to the activation of their intracellular kinase domains (KD) as well as downstream RGF signaling ( Ou et al., 2016 66. Ou, Y. ∙ Lu, X. ∙ Zi, Q. ... RGF1 INSENSITIVE 1 to 5, a group of LRR receptor-like kinases, are essential for the perception of root meristem growth factor 1 in Arabidopsis thaliana Cell Res. 2016; 26 :686-698 Crossref Scopus (135) PubMed Google Scholar ; Song et al., 2016 75.

Signature motif-guided identification of receptors for peptide hormones essential for root meristem growth Cell Res. 2016; 26 :674-685 Crossref Scopus (135) PubMed Google Scholar ). The extracellular pH change may therefore affect the RGF-induced interaction of extracellular domains of RGFRs and SERKs. We initially tried to purify the extracellular domains of RGI1/RGFR4, the RGF1 receptor highly expressed in the RAM ( Ou et al., 2016 66. Ou, Y. ∙ Lu, X. ∙ Zi, Q. ... RGF1 INSENSITIVE 1 to 5, a group of LRR receptor-like kinases, are essential for the perception of root meristem growth factor 1 in Arabidopsis thaliana Cell Res. 2016; 26 :686-698 Crossref Scopus (135) PubMed Google Scholar ; Shinohara et al., 2016 73. Shinohara, H. ∙ Mori, A. ∙ Yasue, N. ... Identification of three LRR-RKs involved in perception of root meristem growth factor in Arabidopsis Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113 :3897-3902 Crossref Scopus (142) PubMed Google Scholar ; Song et al., 2016 75. Song, W. ∙ Liu, L. ∙ Wang, J. ... Signature motif-guided identification of receptors for peptide hormones essential for root meristem growth Cell Res. 2016; 26 :674-685 Crossref Scopus (135) PubMed Google Scholar ); however, this effort was unsuccessful. The structural analysis and sequence alignment revealed that RGI1/RGFR4 and RGI3/RGFR1 share a conserved ligand recognition and receptor activation mechanism ( Figures S4 A and S4B); thus, we alternatively purified RGI3/RGFR1 and the co-receptor SERK1 from an insect cell system. The in vitro gel-filtration assays showed that the purified RGI3/RGFR1 LRR and SERK1 LRR proteins formed a stable complex in the presence of RGF1 at pH 4.0 and 6.0 but disassociated at pH 8.0, indicating that the formation of the RGF1 complex requires an acidic pH ( Figure 4 A).
We also examined the pH dependency of the RGF1-RGI1/RGFR4 interaction in Nicotiana benthamiana . We transiently co-expressed KD-truncated and GFP-tagged RGI1/RGFR4 ▵KD and HA-tagged SERK1 ▵KD in leaves of N. benthamiana and analyzed their interaction at different pH levels using co-immunoprecipitation (coIP). Consistently, RGF1 induced a strong interaction between RGI1/RGFR4 ▵KD -GFP and SERK1 ▵KD -HA at pH 5.0; however, this interaction progressively decreased when the pH increased to 6.0, 7.0, and 8.0 ( Figure 4 B). Altogether, these results demonstrate the acidic pH-dependent manner of the RGF1-receptor complex formation.
To elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying the pH dependency of the formation of the RGF1-receptor complex, we first measured the binding affinities of RGF1 to RGI3/RGFR1 LRR at different pH conditions using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Although they exhibited a strong interaction at pH 6.0, the interaction was completely disrupted at pH 8.0 ( Figure 5 A). We also found pH-dependent interactions between RGI3/RGFR1 and the other five RGF peptides (RGF 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8) ( Figures S5 A and S5B). Interestingly, RGF6, RGF7, and RGF9 peptides were recently found to be involved in leaf-specific immune response ( Stegmann et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2021 77. Stegmann, M. ∙ Zecua-Ramirez, P. ∙ Ludwig, C. ... RGI-GOLVEN signaling promotes cell surface immune receptor abundance to regulate plant immunity EMBO Rep. 2022; 23 :e53281 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar 85. Wang, X. ∙ Zhang, N. ∙ Zhang, L. ...

However, because RGF6, RGF7, and RGF9 did not directly bind to RGI3/RGFR1 ( Figure S5 B) ( Song et al., 2016 75. Song, W. ∙ Liu, L. ∙ Wang, J. ... Signature motif-guided identification of receptors for peptide hormones essential for root meristem growth Cell Res. 2016; 26 :674-685 Crossref Scopus (135) PubMed Google Scholar ), the pH dependency for these three specific RGF peptides is unknown. Nevertheless, six RGF peptides exhibited pH-dependent interactions with the RGI3/RGFR1 receptor, supporting a generality of pH dependency of RGF peptides binding to receptors.
A pH change disturbs the protonation states of the polar residues, which might consequently affect the polar interaction between RGF1 and its receptor RGFRs ( Figure S4 B). Our previously solved crystal structure of the RGF1-RGI3/RGFR1 complex ( Figure 5 B) ( Song et al., 2016 75. Song, W. ∙ Liu, L. ∙ Wang, J. ... Signature motif-guided identification of receptors for peptide hormones essential for root meristem growth Cell Res. 2016; 26 :674-685 Crossref Scopus (135) PubMed Google Scholar ), which alongside a model of the RGF1-RGI1/RGFR4 structure ( Figure S5 C), was used for our molecular analysis. According to our genetic and biochemical data, pH-induced attenuation of RGF1 signaling and formation of RGI-RGF1-SERK1 complex started from pH 5.7 to 6.7 and pH 6.0 to 7.0, respectively ( Figures 3 G, 3H, 4 B, and S3 F), strongly suggesting that the pK a value of the pH sensor is around 6.0–7.0. An examination of the complex structure revealed two histidine residues from RGF1 (H7 and H8) involved in the polar interaction that have a pK a value within this range ( Figures S4 B and S5D; Table S1 ); however, these two histidine residues are not conserved in other RGFs ( Figure S5 E), excluding their possible role in pH sensing. Tyrosine has been shown to function as a pH sensor in the arginine antiporter AdiC, which responds to pH change in the range of 5.5–6.5 through cation-π interaction ( Wang et al., 2014 84. Wang, S. ∙ Yan, R. ∙ Zhang, X. ... Molecular mechanism of pH-dependent substrate transport by an arginine-agmatine antiporter Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111 :12734-12739 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ). Two conserved tyrosine residues (Y258 and Y282 in RGI1/RGFR4) were found to participate in the interaction between RGI1/RGFR4 and RGF1 ( Figure S5 F). However, the coIP assays showed that the mutated RGI1/RGFR4 Y258A,Y282A▵KD still displayed a pH-dependent interaction with RGF1 ( Figure S5 G), excluding these two tyrosine residues as the pH sensor.
Posttranslational sulfation is essential for the bioactivity of the RGFs and their interaction with their receptors ( Matsuzaki et al., 2010 51. Matsuzaki, Y. ∙ Ogawa-Ohnishi, M. ∙ Mori, A. ... Secreted peptide signals required for maintenance of root stem cell niche in Arabidopsis Science. 2010; 329 :1065-1067 Crossref Scopus (363) PubMed Google Scholar ; Song et al., 2016 75. Song, W. ∙ Liu, L. ∙ Wang, J. ... Signature motif-guided identification of receptors for peptide hormones essential for root meristem growth Cell Res. 2016; 26 :674-685 Crossref Scopus (135) PubMed Google Scholar ). Based on the protein structures, the sulfite group of a tyrosine residue in RGF1 (sY2) binds to a pocket in the RGFRs, forming critical hydrogen bond networks with the signature sulfotyrosine-recognition motif RxGG ( Song et al., 2016 75. Song, W. ∙ Liu, L. ∙ Wang, J. ... Signature motif-guided identification of receptors for peptide hormones essential for root meristem growth Cell Res. 2016; 26 :674-685 Crossref Scopus (135) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures 5 B and S5 H). Although the precise pK a of sulfotyrosine remains unknown, the pK a value of the hydrogen sulfite ion (HSO 3 − ) was reported to be 6.91 ( Bruice, 1998 8. Bruice, P.Y. Organic chemistry Pearson, 2007 Google Scholar ), suggesting that sY2 might act as the pH sensor. To test that, we performed a molecular mechanics-Poisson-Boltzmann/surface area (MM-PB/SA) simulation. The simulation result shows that an acidic solution promoted the RGFR LRR -RGF1 interaction, with a binding free energy (ΔG) of −43.49 kcal/mol at pH 6.0 compared with −12.32 kcal/mol at pH 8.0 ( Figure 5 C). Notably, the substitution of the protonated form of sY2 with its deprotonated form significantly increased the binding free energy (ΔG, −17.62 kcal/mol) ( Figures 5 B and 5C), indicating that the alkaline-induced deprotonation of sY2 could largely attenuate the RGF1-RGFR LRR interaction, thus supporting sY2 as the pH sensor.
To provide further evidence in planta , we synthesized a desulfated RGF1 peptide (dRGF1). dRGF1 was previously shown to be capable of inducing RGFR-mediated signaling, albeit with a much lower activity than sulfated RGF1 ( Fernandez et al., 2013 21. Fernandez, A. ∙ Drozdzecki, A. ∙ Hoogewijs, K. ... Transcriptional and functional classification of the GOLVEN/ROOT GROWTH FACTOR/CLE-like signaling peptides reveals their role in lateral root and hair formation Plant Physiol. 2013; 161 :954-970 Crossref Scopus (101) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistent with the previous report, a high dosage of dRGF1 was required to promote RAM activity in the aqc1-1 mutant at pH 5.7. In sharp contrast to RGF1, dRGF1 displayed a comparable promotive activity, regardless of the pH in the medium ( Figures 5 D and 5E), indicating that dRGF1-promoted RAM growth is pH independent. Taken together, these results support that the sulfotyrosine is the pH sensor for RGF1 signaling.
Previously, an in vitro pull-down assay showed that the interaction between Pep1 and PEPR1 LRR was dependent on pH ( Tang et al., 2015 81. Tang, J. ∙ Han, Z. ∙ Sun, Y. ... Structural basis for recognition of an endogenous peptide by the plant receptor kinase PEPR1 Cell Res. 2015; 25 :110-120 Crossref Scopus (131) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, we used a gel-filtration assay to monitor the Pep1-induced PEPR1 LRR interaction with the co-receptor BAK1 LRR under different pH conditions. The gel-filtration data showed that PEPR1 LRR interacted with BAK1 LRR in the presence of Pep1 at pH 6.0 or 8.0; however, the Pep1-induced PEPR1 LRR -BAK1 LRR interaction was completely disrupted at pH 4.0 ( Figure 6 A), in contrast with the case of RGF1-RGFR interaction.
We next studied the alkaline pH-dependent manner of Pep1 signaling in vivo . We first examined the pH effect on Pep1-induced RAM growth inhibition. Both an acidic pH (pH 4.7) and treatment with the proton pump activator FC greatly attenuated Pep1-induced RAM growth inhibition, suggesting that this process is dependent on a relatively alkaline pH ( Figures 6 B and 6C). Given our abovementioned finding that an acidic pH also enhanced RGF1 signaling, this attenuation may be attributed to a combinatory effect of an acidic pH-induced inhibition of Pep1 signaling and promotion of the RGF1 signaling. We then measured the pH effect on the Pep1-induced Ca 2+ influx, an early immune response marker using cytosolic Ca 2+ imaging. A [Ca 2+ ] cyt spike was observed after treatment with Pep1 at pH 5.7; however, the [Ca 2+ ] cyt spike was less pronounced at pH 4.2 ( Figure 6 D), suggesting that the Pep1-induced Ca 2+ influx is promoted by a relatively alkaline pH. Furthermore, we measured the expression of MYB51 , a downstream immune response gene of Pep1 ( Dhar et al., 2021 15. Dhar, S. ∙ Kim, H. ∙ Segonzac, C. ... The danger-associated peptide pep1 directs cellular reprogramming in the Arabidopsis root vascular system Mol. Cells. 2021; 44 :830-842 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Poncini et al., 2017 67. Poncini, L. ∙ Wyrsch, I. ∙ Dénervaud Tendon, V. ... In roots of Arabidopsis thaliana , the damage-associated molecular pattern At Pep1 is a stronger elicitor of immune signalling than flg22 or the chitin heptamer PLoS One. 2017; 12 :e0185808 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ), in response to different pH. GUS staining showed that Pep1-induced MYB51 expression was more pronounced at pH 5.7 and 6.7 than at pH 4.2 and 4.7 ( Figure 6 E). Collectively, our in vitro and in vivo data strongly support that extracellular alkalinization promotes Pep1-induced immune response. Consistently, a recent study reported that ROS production, another downstream event of Pep1 signaling, was suppressed in the root by an acidic extracellular pH ( Yu et al., 2019 92. Yu, K. ∙ Liu, Y. ∙ Tichelaar, R. ... Rhizosphere-associated Pseudomonas suppress local root immune responses by gluconic acid-mediated lowering of environmental pH Curr. Biol. 2019; 29 :3913-3920.e4 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We previously reported the structure of the PEPR1 LRR -Pep1 complex ( Tang et al., 2015 81. Tang, J. ∙ Han, Z. ∙ Sun, Y. ... Structural basis for recognition of an endogenous peptide by the plant receptor kinase PEPR1 Cell Res. 2015; 25 :110-120 Crossref Scopus (131) PubMed Google Scholar ). Based on the structure, we identified numerous Asp/Glu-mediated polar interactions at the Pep1-PEPR1 interface ( Figures 6 F and S6 ). The side chains of Asp and Glu, with pK a values of 3.86 and 4.25 ( Table S1 ), may undergo protonation when the solution pH decreases to 4.0, in turn disrupting the hydrogen bond network mediated by Asp/Glu ( Dobrev et al., 2017 16. Dobrev, P. ∙ Donnini, S. ∙ Groenhof, G. ... Accurate three states model for amino acids with two chemically coupled titrating sites in explicit solvent atomistic constant pH simulations and pK(a) calculations J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2017; 13 :147-160 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ). The Asp/Glu residues may therefore be the potential pH sensor for the relatively alkaline-dependent Pep1-PEPR1 interaction. The MM-PB/SA calculations showed that the free energy ΔG of the PEPR1 LRR -Pep1 binding was −4.75 kcal/mol at pH 6.0 but changed to +51.49 kcal/mol when Asp and Glu were protonated at pH 4.0 ( Figure 6 G), suggesting that the acid-induced protonation of the Asp and Glu residues largely disrupts the PEPR1 LRR -Pep1 interaction.
To further verify the pH-sensing role of the Asp/Glu residues, we introduced substitutions of three of the most conserved Asp/Glu residues (D273N, E324Q, and D348N) into PEPR1 ( Figures 6 H and 6I). Glu and Asp are charged amino acids, and the α-carboxylic acid groups in their side chains are deprotonated at physiological pH ( Dobrev et al., 2017 16. Dobrev, P. ∙ Donnini, S. ∙ Groenhof, G. ... Accurate three states model for amino acids with two chemically coupled titrating sites in explicit solvent atomistic constant pH simulations and pK(a) calculations J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2017; 13 :147-160 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ). The side chains of Gln/Asn are similar to that of Glu/Asp, respectively, except that the carboxylic acid group is replaced by an amide. For this reason, Gln/Asn are charge-neutral polar amino acids that could substitute for Glu/Asp to form similar but relatively weak polar contacts with no protonation or deprotonation change in acidic pH ( Hauser and Barth, 2007 31. Hauser, K. ∙ Barth, A. Side-chain protonation and mobility in the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca 2+ -ATPase: implications for proton countertransport and Ca 2+ release Biophys. J. 2007; 93 :3259-3270 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ). The substitution of Asp/Glu with Gln/Asn therefore mimics the intermediate state during the pH-induced deprotonation-protonation transition. A pull-down assay showed that the PEPR1 D273N and PEPR1 E324Q mutants largely compromised the Pep1-PEPR1 interaction ( Figures 6 I and 6J), suggesting that the polar interactions of these two acidic residues are critical. Strikingly, compared with the wild type, the PEPR1 D348N mutants exhibited a weak interaction with Pep1 even at pH 4.0 ( Figure 6 J), supporting the essential role for this Glu residue in pH sensing. Interestingly, Asp and Glu residues are also found critical for low pH-dependent lysosomal cholesterol egress by NPC1 and NPC2 ( Qian et al., 2020 69. Qian, H. ∙ Wu, X. ∙ Du, X. ... Structural basis of low-pH-dependent lysosomal cholesterol egress by NPC1 and NPC2 Cell. 2020; 182 :98-111.e18 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To provide more definitive evidence to support the finding that extracellular pH is distinctively sensed by the RGF1 and Pep1 peptides binding to their cognate cell-surface receptors, we engineered a chimeric receptor, PEPR1 LRR -RGI1/RGFR4 TM+KD , in which the extracellular domain of RGI1/RGFR4 was replaced by that of PEPR1 ( Figure 7 A). This chimeric receptor was expressed in the pepr1/2 mutant driven by the native promoter of RGI1/RGFR4 , so that the Pep1 signal should only be recognized by the chimeric receptor, which leads to the activation of RGF1 signaling instead of Pep1 signaling. Upon treatment with Pep1, the PEPR1 LRR -RGI1/RGFR4 TM+KD transgenic plants grown on MS medium (pH 5.7) indeed showed a significant increase in RAM size and meristematic cell number ( Figures 7 B and 7C), demonstrating that the chimeric receptor is functional. We then examined the pH response of the transgenic plant. If our findings regarding the pH-sensing mechanism hold true, we would expect a switched pH dependency during RAM growth. Intriguingly, the pH dependency of RAM growth in the transgenic plant was switched from an acidic pH-dependent manner to a relatively alkaline-dependent manner ( Figures 7 B and 7C). This result confirmed that (1) the interaction of Pep1-PEPR1 is relatively alkaline dependent; (2) the acidic-dependent RAM growth is mediated by RGF1 signaling; and (3) the pH dependency is determined by the extracellular domain rather than the intracellular domains or downstream signaling steps. Thus, this domain-swapping assay provides compelling evidence to support our findings of the extracellular pH-sensing mechanism and regulation in the RAM.

Section: Discussion

The acidic nature of the plant apoplast and changes in the extracellular pH in response to biotic and abiotic stresses have been known for decades ( Boller and Felix, 2009 7. Boller, T. ∙ Felix, G. A renaissance of elicitors: perception of microbe-associated molecular patterns and danger signals by pattern-recognition receptors Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2009; 60 :379-406 Crossref Scopus (2440) PubMed Google Scholar ; Cleland, 1973 10. Cleland, R. Auxin-induced hydrogen ion excretion from Avena coleoptiles Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1973; 70 :3092-3093 Crossref Scopus (118) PubMed Google Scholar ; Grignon and Sentenac, 1991 27. Grignon, C.G.a.H. ∙ Sentenac, H. pH and ionic conditions in the apoplast Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1991; 42 :103-128 Crossref Scopus (362) Google Scholar ). Altering pH condition of Arabidopsis roots could induce global gene expression change, suggesting an important role of apoplastic pH in plant responses to the environment ( Lager et al., 2010 43. Lager, I. ∙ Andréasson, O. ∙ Dunbar, T.L. ... Changes in external pH rapidly alter plant gene expression and modulate auxin and elicitor responses Plant Cell Environ. 2010; 33 :1513-1528 PubMed Google Scholar ). In this study, we uncover that the signals triggering PTI response could alter the acidic pH environment in the RAM, which is essential for the cell division of RAM. We further discover that extracellular pH change could be sensed by RGF1 and Pep1 peptide signaling. The alkalinization of the RAM apoplast inhibits the acid-dependent RGF1-RGI/RGFR interaction to inhibit RAM growth. On the other hand, this alkalinization facilitates the relatively alkaline-dependent Pep1-PEPR1 interaction to promote the immune response. Interestingly, swapping the extracellular domains of RGI1/RGFR4 and PEPR1 switches the RAM growth from a relatively acidic-pH-dependent manner to a relatively alkaline-pH-dependent manner. These findings elucidate a mechanism that extracellular pH sensing in plants is mediated by distinctive cell-surface peptide-receptor complexes. By modulating the binding affinity of the peptide ligands to their cognate receptors, the extracellular pH fine-tunes growth and immunity in the RAM ( Figure 7 D).
The plant immune response is often accompanied with growth inhibition ( Karasov et al., 2017 40. Karasov, T.L. ∙ Chae, E. ∙ Herman, J.J. ... Mechanisms to mitigate the trade-off between growth and defense Plant Cell. 2017; 29 :666-680 Crossref Scopus (321) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ning et al., 2017 62. Ning, Y. ∙ Liu, W. ∙ Wang, G.L. Balancing immunity and yield in crop plants Trends Plant Sci. 2017; 22 :1069-1079 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (152) PubMed Google Scholar ). Previous studies revealed that PTI-induced salicylic acid and jasmonic acid signaling antagonize auxin signaling to inhibit root elongation ( Poncini et al., 2017 67. Poncini, L. ∙ Wyrsch, I. ∙ Dénervaud Tendon, V. ... In roots of Arabidopsis thaliana , the damage-associated molecular pattern At Pep1 is a stronger elicitor of immune signalling than flg22 or the chitin heptamer PLoS One. 2017; 12 :e0185808 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ; Robert-Seilaniantz et al., 2011 71. Robert-Seilaniantz, A. ∙ Grant, M. ∙ Jones, J.D. Hormone crosstalk in plant disease and defense: more than just jasmonate-salicylate antagonism Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 2011; 49 :317-343 Crossref Scopus (1440) PubMed Google Scholar ). PTI response can also affect the translocation and expression of the PINs to change the auxin distribution in the root TZ ( Jing et al., 2019 38. Jing, Y. ∙ Zheng, X. ∙ Zhang, D. ... Danger-associated peptides interact with PIN-dependent local auxin distribution to inhibit root growth in Arabidopsis Plant Cell. 2019; 31 :1767-1787 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our finding shows that PTI-induced extracellular alkalinization can also inhibit root meristematic activity and cell proliferation. This pH change is sensed by acidic-pH-dependent RGF1-signaling pathway, which is critical in maintaining the root stem cell niche and regulating meristematic activity ( Matsuzaki et al., 2010 51. Matsuzaki, Y. ∙ Ogawa-Ohnishi, M. ∙ Mori, A. ... Secreted peptide signals required for maintenance of root stem cell niche in Arabidopsis Science. 2010; 329 :1065-1067 Crossref Scopus (363) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yamada et al., 2020 89. Yamada, M. ∙ Han, X. ∙ Benfey, P.N. RGF1 controls root meristem size through ROS signalling Nature. 2020; 577 :85-88 Crossref Scopus (126) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, plant immune responses inhibit root growth through various mechanisms in different regions.
The “acid growth theory” states that auxin-triggered apoplastic acidification activates pH-dependent wall-loosening enzymes to promote cell expansion ( Rayle and Cleland, 1992 70. Rayle, D.L. ∙ Cleland, R.E. The acid growth theory of auxin-induced cell elongation is alive and well Plant Physiol. 1992; 99 :1271-1274 Crossref Scopus (673) PubMed Google Scholar ). Recent studies further reveal that TMK1 mediates the auxin signaling to interact with and activate plasma membrane H + -ATPases via protein phosphorylation, leading to apoplastic acidification and thereby promoting cell elongation in the hypocotyl and root elongation zone ( Li et al., 2021 44. Li, L. ∙ Verstraeten, I. ∙ Roosjen, M. ... Cell surface and intracellular auxin signalling for H + fluxes in root growth Nature. 2021; 599 :273-277 Crossref Scopus (120) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lin et al., 2021 45. Lin, W. ∙ Zhou, X. ∙ Tang, W. ... TMK-based cell-surface auxin signalling activates cell-wall acidification Nature. 2021; 599 :278-282 Crossref Scopus (128) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our finding that acidic pH environment enables cell division by promoting RGF1 interaction with its receptors RGFRs in the root meristem zone provides an additional mechanism of acid-promoted root growth. On the other hand, extracellular alkalinization is the earliest marker of the plant immune response, although little is known about its biological function. Our study reveals that the immune signal Pep1-triggered extracellular alkalinization can inhibit the RGF1-mediated RAM growth and further promote the Peps-mediated immune response, suggesting a role of sensing extracellular alkalinization in coordination of root growth and immunity. Consistently, Yu et al. (2019) 92. Yu, K. ∙ Liu, Y. ∙ Tichelaar, R. ... Rhizosphere-associated Pseudomonas suppress local root immune responses by gluconic acid-mediated lowering of environmental pH Curr. Biol. 2019; 29 :3913-3920.e4 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar reported that a commensal rhizosphere-associated Pseudomonas could acidify root extracellular pH by the secretion of organic acid to inhibit root immunity, suggesting that microbes may utilize plant pH regulation mechanism to counteract plant immunity. In addition, we also found that altering medium pH was sufficient to change RGF1 and Pep1 signaling. Given that the root apoplast is an important interface with soil, it is likely that pH sensing in the RAM may also be involved in response to abiotic stress, such as salinity or drought-induced extracellular alkalinization, although further investigation is needed.
A noteworthy finding of this study is the identification of sulfotyrosine in RGF1 peptide as a pH sensor. Posttranslational sulfation is essential for the bioactivity of RGFs and their interaction with their receptors ( Matsuzaki et al., 2010 51. Matsuzaki, Y. ∙ Ogawa-Ohnishi, M. ∙ Mori, A. ... Secreted peptide signals required for maintenance of root stem cell niche in Arabidopsis Science. 2010; 329 :1065-1067 Crossref Scopus (363) PubMed Google Scholar ; Song et al., 2016 75. Song, W. ∙ Liu, L. ∙ Wang, J. ... Signature motif-guided identification of receptors for peptide hormones essential for root meristem growth Cell Res. 2016; 26 :674-685 Crossref Scopus (135) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, we have provided multiple lines of evidence to support that the sulfotyrosine is also critical for sensing pH. We firstly narrowed down the pK a value of pH sensor to pH 6.0–7.0 by examining pH-dependent formation of RGF1-RGI1-SERK1 complex. Then, we evaluated the possibility of the residues involved in the polar interaction of RGF1 and RGIs and identified the sulfotyrosine as a possible pH sensor. We next conducted MD simulation to show that the free energy of sulfotyrosine-mediated interaction was much lower at acidic pH than at alkaline pH. Finally, we synthesized a de-sulfated RGF1 peptide and observed dRGF1-induced RAM growth in a pH-independent manner. Our genetic data showed that aqc1-1 , a mutant lacking endogenous tyrosyl-protein sulfotransferase (TPST) activity, lost pH dependency of RAM growth. By contrast, the pH-dependent RAM growth was re-established in aqc1-1 upon treatment of synthesized RGF1 but not dRGF1 peptide, which confirmed the pH-sensing role of sulfotyrosine. Notably, HPTS, which was used as a pH indicator in this and many previous studies ( Barbez et al., 2017 5. Barbez, E. ∙ Dünser, K. ∙ Gaidora, A. ...

Spry, D.B. ∙ Goun, A. ∙ Bell, C.B. ... Identification and properties of the 1La and 1lb states of pyranine J. Chem. Phys. 2006; 125 :144514 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ), has a structure analogous to that of sulfotyrosine ( Figure S5 I). The changes in the protonated and deprotonated states of HPTS confer the pH-sensing function ( Kumar et al., 2018 42. Kumar, R. ∙ Yadav, R. ∙ Kolhe, M.A. ... 8-Hydroxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid trisodium salt (HPTS) based high fluorescent, pH stimuli waterborne polyurethane coatings Polymer. 2018; 136 :157-165 Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar ), which is consistent with the pH-sensing mechanism of the RGF peptides. Moreover, another plant peptide with sulfotyrosine modification, phytosulfokine (PSK), has been reported to bind its cell-surface receptor also in an acid-dependent manner, whose binding affinity decreases 25-fold when pH is changed from 4.0 to 7.0 ( Matsubayashi and Sakagami, 1999 49. Matsubayashi, Y. ∙ Sakagami, Y. Characterization of specific binding sites for a mitogenic sulfated peptide, phytosulfokine-alpha, in the plasma-membrane fraction derived from Oryza sativa L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262 :666-671 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ). Given that posttranslational modifications are common signatures of small secreted peptides and are essential for their bioactivities ( Matsubayashi, 2014 48. Matsubayashi, Y. Posttranslationally modified small-peptide signals in plants Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2014; 65 :385-413 Crossref Scopus (257) PubMed Google Scholar ), it would be of great interest to investigate whether extracellular pH changes have an impact on the signaling output of those sulfated peptides.
The extracellular pH is a critical factor for biological processes in many forms of life. The membrane receptors, such as membrane-bound histidine kinases, G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), and receptor tyrosine-kinases (RTKs) have been well established as extracellular pH sensors in bacteria, fungi, and animals ( Buchner et al., 2015 9.

The G protein-coupled receptor T-cell death-associated gene 8 (TDAG8) facilitates tumor development by serving as an extracellular pH sensor Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107 :17309-17314 Crossref Scopus (77) PubMed Google Scholar ; Müller et al., 2009 60. Müller, S. ∙ Götz, M. ∙ Beier, D. Histidine residue 94 is involved in pH sensing by histidine kinase ArsS of Helicobacter pylori PLoS One. 2009; 4 :e6930 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ; Obara et al., 2012 64. Obara, K. ∙ Yamamoto, H. ∙ Kihara, A. Membrane protein Rim21 plays a central role in sensing ambient pH in Saccharomyces cerevisiae J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287 :38473-38481 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast, little information is known about how plants sense extracellular pH. Our finding reveals that RGF1-RGFR and Pep1-PEPR can sense extracellular pH changes, suggesting that the membrane receptor RLKs can function as extracellular pH sensors in plants. Supportively, many other extracellular signaling molecules, such as CLE peptides, RALF peptides, and the phytohormone brassinolide, are found to bind to their cognate RLK receptors in pH-dependent manners, although the pH-sensing mechanisms are unknown ( Gonneau et al., 2018 26. Gonneau, M. ∙ Desprez, T. ∙ Martin, M. ... Receptor kinase THESEUS1 is a rapid alkalinization factor 34 receptor in Arabidopsis Curr.

Structure reveals that BAK1 as a co-receptor recognizes the BRI1-bound brassinolide Cell Res. 2013; 23 :1326-1329 Crossref Scopus (203) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is thus conceivable that the extracellular pH could also be sensed by these plant RLKs during plant development and response to environmental cues.
We focused on understanding how PTI-triggered extracellular alkalization is sensed by RGF1 and Peps peptide-receptor complexes in the root meristem zone. Additional studies into extracellular pH sensing by RGF-RGFR and Pep-PEPR in other tissues and even other receptor-like kinase-mediated pH-sensing processes will be a critical next step in further delineating the mechanisms of plant extracellular pH perception. In addition, we show that not only PTI-triggered alkalization but also altering medium pH was sufficient to change RGF1 and Peps signaling response. Thus, future studies of abiotic stress-triggered extracellular alkalization and plant-microbe interaction-induced extracellular pH changes could be performed to verify our findings. Another limitation of the study is the measurement of absolute pH values in the apoplast. Although HPTS has been used as a powerful pH indicator to track the relative change of extracellular pH, the absolute pH values in the apoplast cannot be directly read from HPTS fluorescence. Thus, further technological advances are needed for accurately measuring extracellular pH.

Arabidopsis seeds were plated on Murashige and Skoog medium (4.4 g/L MS salts, 1 % [w/v] sucrose, pH 5.7, and 0.8% [w/v] agar) in petri dishes after surface-sterilization in 70% ethanol and 0.1% Triton X-100. The dishes were stored at 4 °C for 3 days, and then vertically placed in an incubator with a 16/8 h light/dark cycle at 22 °C in 70% humidity to grow.
Different pH MS medium was adjusted by KOH.
FC (Santa cruz) and DCCD (Sigma-Aldrich) were dissolved in DMSO as 5 mM stocks, frozen at -20 °C, and RGF1, dRGF1, Pep1, flg22 and elf18 peptides were dissolved in double distilled water as 100 mM stocks. These chemicals were dissolved to final concentration (5 μM FC and DCCD, 10 nM Pep1, 100 nM RGF1, flg22 and elf18, 5 μM dRGF1 unless specified labeled) in MS medium before solidification.
Culture conditions for Pseudomonas R401 and R569 were performed as previously described ( Ma et al., 2021 46. Ma, K.W. ∙ Niu, Y. ∙ Jia, Y. ... Coordination of microbe-host homeostasis by crosstalk with plant innate immunity Nat. Plants. 2021; 7 :814-825 Crossref Scopus (88) PubMed Google Scholar ) with minor modifications. Bacterial strains were inoculated on 50% tryptic soy broth (TSB) agar plates from the glycerol stock, and incubated at 25°C overnight. Before use, strains were cultured in 50% TSB liquid medium to saturation, and subcultured to log phase with fresh medium at a 1:100 ratio. Bacterial cultures were pelleted by centrifugation at 5 000× g for 5 min, followed by two washes with 10 mM MgSO 4 . After washing, bacteria were diluted with 10 mM MgSO 4 to an OD 600 of 0.005. Bacterial suspension was dripped on the roots of 4-day-old seedlings, and incubated for 6 h, followed by HPTS staining assay.
For quantitative root length measurement, 3-day-old Col-0 and pepr1/2 seedlings were transferred to fresh MS medium with or without Pep1 to continuously grow for 4 days. Images of 7-day-old seedlings were captured using a digital camera. Roots were measured using ImageJ software (NIH). The experiments were repeated at least three times with similar results.
For confocal microscopic analysis, 4-day-old (Col-0 background and RGI1/RGFR4pro:PEPR1 LRR -RGI1/RGFR4 TM+KD / pepr1 pepr2 ) or 5-day-old ( aqc1-1 and rgi1,2,3,4 background) seedlings were transferred to the respective MS medium for 12 h ( RGFR1pro:PEPR1 LRR -RGFR1 TM+KD / pepr1 pepr2 ), 1 day (Col-0 and rgi1,2,3,4 ) or 2 days ( aqc1-1 ). The seedlings were stained with 10 μM propidium iodide for 5 min, gently washed with double distilled water, and mounted on glass slides and analyzed at 600-640 nm for propidium iodide or 525-565 nm for YFP using a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM880).
The numbers of root meristematic cells were obtained by counting the cortex cells from the cell proximal to the QC to rapid elongated cell. The cell length of root mature cells was obtained by measuring the length of epidermal cells in differentiation zone using ImageJ software (NIH). The fluorescence intensity was measured using ImageJ software (NIH). The experiments were repeated at least three times with similar results.
HPTS staining was performed as previously described ( Barbez et al., 2017 5. Barbez, E. ∙ Dünser, K. ∙ Gaidora, A. ... Auxin steers root cell expansion via apoplastic pH regulation in Arabidopsis thaliana Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :E4884-E4893 Crossref Scopus (228) PubMed Google Scholar ) with minor modifications. 4-day-old seedlings grown on standard MS medium were mounted in different pH or treatment MS medium supplemented with 1 mM HPTS on a microcopy slide for 2 h before observation. For bacteria-treated samples, seedlings were mounted on 1 mM HPTS-contained MS medium for 30 min before observation. Values shown in the boxplots are relative 458/405 value to mock or pH 5.7 of the same region around root meristem. The signal aggregates were excluded during data processing. The experiments were repeated at least three times with similar results.
Transient expression in N. benthamiana was performed as described previously( Song et al., 2016 75. Song, W. ∙ Liu, L. ∙ Wang, J. ... Signature motif-guided identification of receptors for peptide hormones essential for root meristem growth Cell Res. 2016; 26 :674-685 Crossref Scopus (135) PubMed Google Scholar ) with minor modifications. Agrobacterium strains (GV3101) harboring above-described constructs were cultured in liquid Luria-Bertani medium overnight. The dense cultures were inoculated into fresh medium by 1:100 dilution and incubated for 6-8 h. The bacteria were sedimented and resuspended in infiltration buffer (5 g/L glucose, 10 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM MES-KOH, pH 5.7) to an OD 600 of 0.4∼1.0. The resuspended agrobacteria were infiltrated into tobacco leaves using 1 mL syringes without needles. For co-expression, resuspended bacteria containing different constructs were mixed to an OD 600 of 0.4∼1.0. All tobacco tissues were recovered for 48 h before harvested.
The co-immunoprecipitation and immunoblot assays were performed as previously described ( Song et al., 2016 75. Song, W. ∙ Liu, L. ∙ Wang, J. ... Signature motif-guided identification of receptors for peptide hormones essential for root meristem growth Cell Res. 2016; 26 :674-685 Crossref Scopus (135) PubMed Google Scholar ) with minor modifications. The expression of proteins of interest was tested by immunoblot assays at first. The tobacco leaves were rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen after harvest, and ground into fine powder. A fraction of powder was added with an equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer (4% SDS, 100 mM Bis-Tris pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% β-mercaptoethanol), and incubated on ice for 15 min, followed by heating for 10 min at 65 °C. After centrifugation at 13 000× g for 5 min, the protein extracts were fractionated by 10% SDS-PAGE, blotted onto a PVDF membrane. Immunoblot assay was then performed using anti-GFP antibody (Chromo Tek) and anti-HA antibody (Santa Cruz).
For co-immunoprecipitation, 500 μl well-expressed sample was distributed in each tube and homogenized in 1.5 mL ice cold PBS buffer (25mM NaH 2 PO 4 +Na 2 HPO 4 , 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.1% NP-40, 1× protease cocktail inhibitor (Roche), pH value was adjusted by mixing different volume of NaH 2 PO 4 and Na 2 HPO 4 ). RGF1 and dRGF1 peptides were supplemented for 15 min, as indicated. Lysates were centrifuged twice at 13 000× g at 4 °C for 10 min. For input sample, 80 μl supernatant was transferred to a new tube and 20 μl of 5× SDS sample buffer (10% SDS, 250 mM Bis-Tris pH 6.8, 50% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.05% bromophenol blue) was added. In all, 1.2 mL supernatant was transferred to a new tube to incubate with 10 μl GFP-trap agarose beads (Chromo Tec, Cat# Gta-200) for 2 h at 4 °C with gentle agitation. Next, the beads were washed six times with the corresponding pH PBS buffer, and centrifuged at 2 000× g at 4 °C for 2 min each time. A total of 60 μl 5× SDS sample buffer was added after the last wash. Subsequently, all the samples were boiled at 75 °C for 10 min. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblot assays using anti-HA antibody and anti-GFP antibody. Signals were either captured on X-ray film and developed using a Kodak MXP-102 or directly recorded using a Tanon 5200 Multi chemiluminescent imaging system (Tanon, Shanghai, China).
All of the LRR proteins were expressed in High Five cells at 28 °C. One liter of insect cells (2 × 10 6 cells per mL) was infected with 30 mL baculovirus and the media were harvested after 60 h of infection. All of the proteins were purified using Ni-NTA (Novagen). After elution and concentration, the proteins were further purified by size-exclusion chromatography (Hiload 200, GE Healthcare) in buffer containing 10 mM Bis-Tris, pH 6.0, and 100 mM NaCl.
The samples (RGI3/RGFR1 LRR -SERK1 LRR -RGF1 mixture and PEPR1 LRR -BAK1 LRR -Pep1 mixture) were incubated on ice for 1 h; then assayed by gel filtration (Hiload 200, GE Healthcare) in three pH buffers (10 mM citric acid, pH 4.0, 100 mM NaCl; 10 mM Bis-Tris, pH 6.0,100 mM NaCl; and 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl). The peak fractions were used for SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie blue staining.
ITC200 was used to quantify the binding affinity of RGF1 with RGI3/RGFR1 LRR . The protein samples for ITC were prepared in buffers with different pH (10 mM Bis-Tris, pH 6.0, 100 mM NaCl; and 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl). The titrations were performed at 25 °C. The stirring speed was 750 rpm. 1mM RGF peptide was injected into the stirred calorimeter cells containing 0.05 mM RGI3/RGFR1 LRR . All of the ITC data were analyzed using MicroCal Origin 7.0.
MD simulations for RGF1 and RGI3/RGFR1: The coordinates of residues Leu-96–Ser-514 of RGI3/RGFR1 in complex with RGF1 were taken from the crystal structure (PDB: 5HYX ) ( Song et al., 2016 75. Song, W. ∙ Liu, L. ∙ Wang, J. ... Signature motif-guided identification of receptors for peptide hormones essential for root meristem growth Cell Res. 2016; 26 :674-685 Crossref Scopus (135) PubMed Google Scholar ) to use as an initial structure for MD simulations. The Amber ff14SB force field and the generalized Amber force field (GAFF) parameters were used for canonical amino acids and the sulfotyrosine (sTyr) residue, respectively. To examine the effect of pH in the MD simulations, we prepared three conditions: all histidine and sTyr residues of the RGI3/RGFR1 and RGF1 were protonated to simulate an aqueous solution at pH 6.0, all histidine residues were protonated but sTyr was deprotonated (referred to as dp-sTyr pH 6.0), and ε-protonated histidine and deprotonated sTyr were used for pH 8.0. The protein and ligand structures were solvated with the TIP3P water ( Jorgensen et al., 1983 39. Jorgensen, W.L. ∙ Chandrasekhar, J. ∙ Madura, J.D. ... Comparison of simple potential functions for simulating liquid water J. Chem. Phys. 1983; 79 :926-935 Crossref Scopus (33497) Google Scholar ) in a cubic box with edge lengths of 125 Å under periodic boundary conditions. Na + or Cl − ions were included to neutralize the protein charge, then further ions were added corresponding to a salt solution of concentration 0.15 M. Protocols of energy minimization and equilibration of the system were previously described ( Moriwaki et al., 2013 56. Moriwaki, Y. ∙ Terada, T. ∙ Caaveiro, J.M. ... Heme binding mechanism of structurally similar iron-regulated surface determinant near transporter domains of Staphylococcus aureus exhibiting different affinities for heme Biochemistry. 2013; 52 :8866-8877 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ). After the equilibration, a production run was performed for each protonated state in the NPT ensemble at 300 K for 200 ns. Coordinates were saved every 10 ps. These MD simulations were performed using GROMACS 2018.5 package ( Abraham et al., 2015 1. Abraham, M.J. ∙ Murtola, T. ∙ Schulz, R. ... GROMACS: high performance molecular simulations through multi-level parallelism from laptops to supercomputers SoftwareX. 2015; 1–2 :19-25 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (14546) Google Scholar ).
MD simulations for PEP1 and PEPR1: Similar to the MD simulations for RGF1 and RGI3/RGFR1, an initial structure was taken from the coordinates of residues Leu-29–Gln-545 of PEPR1 in complex with PEP1 (PDB: 5GR8 ) ( Tang et al., 2015 81. Tang, J. ∙ Han, Z. ∙ Sun, Y. ... Structural basis for recognition of an endogenous peptide by the plant receptor kinase PEPR1 Cell Res. 2015; 25 :110-120 Crossref Scopus (131) PubMed Google Scholar ). All histidine residues in the complex were protonated to simulate an aqueous solution at pH 6.0. For pH 4.0 acidic condition, all aspartate and glutamate residues were also set to be protonated along with the histidine. Force field, water models, and simulation procedure used for the complex were the same as for RGF1 and RGI3/RGFR1.
Calculation of binding free energy using the MM-PB/SA method: The molecular mechanics–Poisson–Boltzmann/surface area (MM-PB/SA) method was employed to calculate the binding free energies for the complexes between RGFR1 and RGF1 in protonated and deprotonated conditions. The solvation free energy is the sum of polar (ΔGPB) and nonpolar (ΔGNP) parts. ΔGPB was calculated by solving Poisson–Boltzmann equation with interior and exterior dielectric constants of 2 and 80, respectively, with a salt concentration of 0.2 M. ΔGNP was determined on the basis of solvent accessible surface area (SASA): ΔGNP = 0.0378×ΔSASA − 0.5692 + ΔG dispersion , where SASA was the solvent accessible surface area and ΔG dispersion was the dispersion term( Tan et al., 2007 79. Tan, C. ∙ Tan, Y.H. ∙ Luo, R. Implicit nonpolar solvent models J. Phys. Chem. B. 2007; 111 :12263-12274 Crossref Scopus (199) PubMed Google Scholar ). The solvent probe radius used in the calculation of SASA was set at 1.4 Å. These calculations were performed using MMPBSA.py module in AmberTools 18.
To monitor peptide-induced change of [Ca 2+ ] cyt , 7-day-old Col-0 seedlings expressing genetically encoded FRET-based Ca 2+ sensor YC3.6 was used ( Monshausen et al., 2008 55. Monshausen, G.B. ∙ Messerli, M.A. ∙ Gilroy, S. Imaging of the Yellow Cameleon 3.6 indicator reveals that elevations in cytosolic Ca 2+ follow oscillating increases in growth in root hairs of Arabidopsis Plant Physiol. 2008; 147 :1690-1698 Crossref Scopus (204) PubMed Google Scholar ; Nagai et al., 2004 61. Nagai, T. ∙ Yamada, S. ∙ Tominaga, T. ... Expanded dynamic range of fluorescent indicators for Ca(2+) by circularly permuted yellow fluorescent proteins Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101 :10554-10559 Crossref Scopus (898) PubMed Google Scholar ). Seedlings were grown in PDMS RootChips as described ( Grossmann et al., 2012 36. Grossmann, G. ∙ Meier, M. ∙ Cartwright, H.N. ... Time-lapse fluorescence imaging of Arabidopsis root growth with rapid manipulation of the root environment using the RootChip J. Vis. Exp. 2012; 65 :4290 Google Scholar ), with each single root grown in an independent channel filled with liquid growth buffer (1/2 MS, 1% sugar, 10 mM MES, pH 5.7). YC3.6 imaging was taken by a Zeiss LSM 880 microscope, with excitation using the 458 nm line of the argon laser and emission collected at 484-505 nm and 526-536 nm for Ca 2+ -dependent CFP and cpVenus (FRET) fluorescence, respectively. All samples were pre-perfusioned with fresh medium of indicated pH for at least 15 min to equilibrate the extracellular pH condition. No perturbation of [Ca 2+ ] cyt was found by simply pausing and restarting the perfusion that was needed for medium shifting.
5-day-old seedlings were collected and treated with 100 nM Pep1 in liquid MS medium at different pH for 6 h. After treatment, the seedlings were washed with staining buffer without X-Gluc, stained with GUS staining buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 10 mM Na 2 EDTA, 0.5 mM K 4 [Fe(CN) 6 ]·3H 2 O, 0.5 mM K 3 [Fe(CN) 6 ], 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 mg/ml X-Gluc), incubated at 37 °C for 12 h, and then ethanol (70%) was used to terminate the staining reaction. The seedlings were cleared in chloral hydrate solution (chloral hydrate:water:glycerol = 8:2:1; w/v/v) for 5 min before observation. Pictures were taken using a Zeiss AxioImage A2 microscope. The experiments were repeated at least three times with similar results.
To construct C-terminal GFP-tagged RGI1/RGFR4▵KD (pCHF3-RGI1▵KD-GFP), the kinase domain truncated RGI1/RGFR4 (1-2241 bp) was amplified using the primers pCHF3-Kpn I-RGI1 -Gib-F and pCHF3-RGI1dK-Bam HI-Gib-R from Arabidopsis Col-0 cDNA, and inserted into Kpn I and Bam HI sites of vector pCHF3-GFP by Gibson cloning. The Y258A and Y282A mutations on pCHF3-RGI1▵KD-GFP were generated with the help of primers RGI1-Y258A-mutant-F and RGI1-Y258-mutant-R, RGI1-Y282A-mutant-F and RGI1-Y282-mutant-R, respectively, using KOD-Plus-Mutagenesis Kit (TOYOBO).
The kinase domain truncated SERK1 (1-825 bp) was amplified using the primers Sac I-SERK1-F and SERK1dK-HA-Kpn I-R from Arabidopsis Col-0 cDNA, and inserted into Sac I and Kpn I sites of vector pCAMBIA1307 (a derivative of pCAMBIA1300 by inserting CaMV 35S promoter sequence prior to multiple cloning site) to generate construct of pCAMBIA1307-SERK1▵KD-HA by restriction enzyme digestion.
To express receptor LRR domains of RGI3/RGFR1 (residues 1–702), PEPR1 (residues 1–767), SERK1 (residues 1–213), and BAK1 (residues 1–220) protein in insect cell system, we generated C-terminal 6× His-tagged LRR proteins construction into the vector pFastBac1 (Invitrogen).
To construct the chimeric receptor RGI1/RGFR4pro:PEPR1 LRR -RGI1/RGFR4 TM+KD -HA, native promoter of RGI1/RGFR4 (∼2 kb) was amplified using the primers pQG110-Pst I-RGI1pro-F and RGI1pro-PEPR1-R from Arabidopsis Col-0 genomic DNA, LRR domain of PEPR1 and transmembrane domain and kinase domain of RGI1/RGFR4 with epitope HA tag were amplified from Arabidopsis Col-0 cDNA using the primers RGI1pro-PEPR1-F and PEPR1LRR-RGI1TM-R, PEPR1LRR-RGI1TM-F and PEPR1LRR-RGI1TM-F, respectively. Then these three fragments were combined using the primers pQG110-Pst I-RGI1pro-F and pQG110-RGI1-HA-Sal I-R, and inserted into Pst I and Sal I sites of vector pQG110 by Gibson cloning. Of note, the sequence 5’ggcgtagtcaggcacgtcgtaaggata3’ in primer SERK1dK-HA-Kpn I-R and pQG110-RGI1-HA-Sal I-R encodes the HA tag.
The oligonucleotide primers for all constructs are summarized in Table S2 . All constructs described above were verified by DNA sequencing analysis.
All experiments involving measurements/quantifications, imaging and quantifications from images were repeated at least three times with similar results. Data plotting and statistical tests were performed in R. In graphs showing quantification, all data points (biologically independent samples, n) are plotted using box-and-whisker plot. In all graphs, asterisks indicate statistical significance (NS, not significant, ∗ P <0.05; ∗∗ P <0.01; ∗∗∗ P <0.001) tested by Student’s t test (two groups), and lowercase letters indicate statistical significance tested between multiple groups by one/two-way ANOVA at p < 0.001.
