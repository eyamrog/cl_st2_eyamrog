Title: Restriction of HIV-1 Escape by a Highly Broad and Potent Neutralizing Antibody


Abstract: Summary

Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) represent a promising approach to prevent and treat HIV-1 infection. However, viral escape through mutation of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) limits clinical applications. Here we describe 1-18, a new V H 1-46-encoded CD4 binding site (CD4bs) bNAb with outstanding breadth (97%) and potency (GeoMean IC 50 = 0.048 μg/mL). Notably, 1-18 is not susceptible to typical CD4bs escape mutations and effectively overcomes HIV-1 resistance to other CD4bs bNAbs. Moreover, mutational antigenic profiling uncovered restricted pathways of HIV-1 escape. Of most promise for therapeutic use, even 1-18 alone fully suppressed viremia in HIV-1-infected humanized mice without selecting for resistant viral variants. A 2.5-Å cryo-EM structure of a 1-18-BG505 SOSIP.664 Env complex revealed that these characteristics are likely facilitated by a heavy-chain insertion and increased inter-protomer contacts. The ability of 1-18 to effectively restrict HIV-1 escape pathways provides a new option to successfully prevent and treat HIV-1 infection.

Section: Introduction

Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) targeting the HIV-1 envelope protein (Env) can prevent infection in animal models and are under investigation for passive immunization in clinical trials ( Balazs et al., 2011; Gautam et al., 2016; Julg and Barouch, 2019; Moldt et al., 2012; Shingai et al., 2014 3.

Moreover, bNAbs have been demonstrated to suppress viremia and delay viral rebound after interruption of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in HIV-1-infected individuals ( Bar et al., 2016; Bar-On et al., 2018; Caskey et al., 2015, 2017; Lynch et al., 2015a; Mendoza et al., 2018; Scheid et al., 2016 4.

Although these results highlight the significant clinical potential of bNAbs, pre-existing or de novo HIV-1 resistance cause treatment failure and can strongly limit bNAb applications in humans ( Bar et al., 2016; Bar-On et al., 2018; Caskey et al., 2015, 2017; Lynch et al., 2015a; Mendoza et al., 2018; Scheid et al., 2016 4.

HIV-1 antibody 3BNC117 suppresses viral rebound in humans during treatment interruption Nature. 2016; 535 :556-560 Crossref Scopus (185) PubMed Google Scholar ). Strategies to prevent and overcome viral escape are therefore critical to effectively implement bNAb-mediated approaches for HIV-1 prevention and therapy ( Caskey et al., 2019; Gruell and Klein, 2018 11. Caskey, M. ∙ Klein, F. ∙ Nussenzweig, M.C. Broadly neutralizing anti-HIV-1 monoclonal antibodies in the clinic Nat. Med. 2019; 25 :547-553 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar 39. Gruell, H. ∙ Klein, F. Antibody-mediated prevention and treatment of HIV-1 infection Retrovirology. 2018; 15 :73 Crossref Scopus (1) PubMed Google Scholar ).
In recent years, potent bNAbs have been isolated from HIV-1-infected donors that target distinct vulnerable epitopes on the Env trimer. These epitopes include the CD4 binding site (CD4bs), the V1/V2 loop, the V3 loop glycan patch, the membrane-proximal external region (MPER), and the interface between the gp120 and gp41 subunits ( Gama and Koup, 2018; Sok and Burton, 2018; Walker and Burton, 2018 32.

Passive immunotherapy of viral infections: ‘super-antibodies’ enter the fray Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2018; 18 :297-308 Crossref Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ). Among these sites, the CD4bs is of particular interest because CD4 serves as the primary receptor for viral entry ( Kwong et al., 1998; Maddon et al., 1986; Zhou et al., 2007 58.

Most potent CD4bs bNAbs are characterized by use of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene segment IGVH1-2 ∗ 02, high levels of somatic hypermutation, a five-residue complementarity-determining region 3 of the light chain (CDRL3), and mimicry of the CD4-Env interaction ( West et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2010, 2013, 2015 110.

Named after the prototypical antibody, these antibodies are referred to as VRC01-class bNAbs ( Wu et al., 2010 113. Wu, X. ∙ Yang, Z.Y. ∙ Li, Y. ... Rational design of envelope identifies broadly neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies to HIV-1 Science. 2010; 329 :856-861 Crossref Scopus (1099) PubMed Google Scholar ). Additional members of this class include 3BNC117, NIH45-46, N49-P7, N6, and VRC07-523 ( Huang et al., 2016a; Rudicell et al., 2014; Sajadi et al., 2018; Scheid et al., 2011 47.

Sequence and structural convergence of broad and potent HIV antibodies that mimic CD4 binding Science. 2011; 333 :1633-1637 Crossref Scopus (694) PubMed Google Scholar ). Other bNAbs that mimic CD4 binding are derived from the V H 1-46 gene segment. However, compared with V H 1-2-derived bNAbs, the V H 1-46 bNAbs reported to date have lower potencies and breadth, which limits their potential for clinical use ( Bonsignori et al., 2016; Gao et al., 2014; Scheid et al., 2011 8. Bonsignori, M. ∙ Zhou, T. ∙ Sheng, Z. ..., NISC Comparative Sequencing Program Maturation Pathway from Germline to Broad HIV-1 Neutralizer of a CD4-Mimic Antibody Cell. 2016; 165 :449-463 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (138) PubMed Google Scholar 33.

Sequence and structural convergence of broad and potent HIV antibodies that mimic CD4 binding Science. 2011; 333 :1633-1637 Crossref Scopus (694) PubMed Google Scholar ). For example, CH235.12, one of the best V H 1-46-derived CD4bs antibodies, is less broad and more than 10-fold less potent than the VRC01-class bNAb N6 when tested against a large panel of HIV-1 strains ( Bonsignori et al., 2016 8.

Accordingly, all CD4bs bNAbs that have advanced into clinical testing are members of the VRC01 class (3BNC117, N6, VRC01, and VRC07-523) ( Bar et al., 2016; Bar-On et al., 2018; Caskey et al., 2015, 2019; Cohen et al., 2018a; Crowell et al., 2019; Gaudinski et al., 2018, 2019; Gruell and Klein, 2018; Ledgerwood et al., 2015; Lynch et al., 2015a; Mayer et al., 2017; Mendoza et al., 2018; Riddler et al., 2018; Scheid et al., 2016 4.

Here we describe bNAb 1-18, a V H 1-46-derived CD4bs antibody that exceeds the potency and breadth of most classical V H 1-46- and V H 1-2-derived bNAbs. The structural basis of its high activity was revealed by a single-particle cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of a 1-18 Fab-BG505 SOSIP.664 Env trimer complex solved at 2.5-Å resolution. Of particular interest, compared with 3BNC117 and VRC01, the two most clinically advanced CD4bs bNAbs, 1-18 effectively restricts viral escape and maintains both neutralizing activity against VRC01-class escape variants and full viral suppression when tested in HIV-1 YU2 -infected humanized mice. Therefore, 1-18 is a highly promising candidate for antibody-mediated strategies to effectively treat and prevent HIV-1 infection.

Section: Results

To identify individuals with elite HIV-1-neutralizing activity, we screened HIV-1-infected subjects. From each individual, purified serum or plasma immunoglobulin G (IgG) was tested for neutralizing activity in a TZM-bl cell assay against a multiclade screening panel of 12 HIV-1 pseudoviruses ( deCamp et al., 2014; Sarzotti-Kelsoe et al., 2014 19. deCamp, A. ∙ Hraber, P. ∙ Bailer, R.T. ...

Methods. 2014; 409 :131-146 Crossref Scopus (162) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 1 A). We identified IDC561, a clade B-infected long-term non-progressor ( Walker and Yu, 2013 107. Walker, B.D. ∙ Yu, X.G. Unravelling the mechanisms of durable control of HIV-1 Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2013; 13 :487-498 Crossref Scopus (133) PubMed Google Scholar ), as ranking among the top 1% of a cohort of 2,274 individuals (HIV-1-neutralizing activity at a geometric mean IC 50 [50% inhibitory concentration] of 41.7 μg IgG/mL; Figures 1 A and S1 A–S1C). To characterize the epitope specificity of the IgG response, we performed neutralization fingerprinting and detected VRC01-like activity ( Doria-Rose et al., 2017 25. Doria-Rose, N.A. ∙ Altae-Tran, H.R. ∙ Roark, R.S. ... Mapping Polyclonal HIV-1 Antibody Responses via Next-Generation Neutralization Fingerprinting PLoS Pathog. 2017; 13 :e1006148 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure S1 D). However, virus obtained from IDC561 was sensitive to 3BNC117 and N6, suggesting that the HIV-1-neutralizing antibodies in IDC561 differ from VRC01-class antibodies ( Figure S1 E).
To identify antibodies that accounted for the potent neutralizing activity of IDC561, we performed single-cell sorting of Env-reactive B cells that bound to native-like BG505 SOSIP.664 ( Sanders et al., 2013; Sliepen et al., 2015 83. Sanders, R.W. ∙ Derking, R. ∙ Cupo, A. ...

Using a new amplification strategy with primer sets optimized for precise detection of highly mutated IgG gene segments (OPT5/oPR; Kreer et al., 2019 54. Kreer, C. ∙ Döring, M. ∙ Lehnen, N. ... openPrimeR for multiplex amplification of highly diverse templates bioRxiv. 2019; Crossref Google Scholar ), we obtained and analyzed 812 IgG heavy-chain sequences (BG505 SOSIP.664 , n = 445; YU2 gp140 , n = 367) ( Figure 1 B). Compared with the total IgG + B cell reservoir of IDC561, Env-reactive B cells carried slightly longer CDRH3s (median length of 17 versus 16 amino acids, p < 0.001), had higher levels of somatic mutation (median V H gene nucleotide germline identity of 88.4% versus 95.3%, p < 0.001), and were enriched for the V H gene segments 1-46, 1-69, and 4-4 ( Figures S1 F–S1H). Among Env-reactive B cells, we identified 80 B cell clones with two or more members ( Figure 1 B).
Following production of monoclonal antibodies ( Table S1 ), binding of both BG505 SOSIP.664 and YU2 gp140 was detected by ELISA for 70% of the tested antibody clones ( Figure 1 C; Table S2 ). The antibodies of most clones showed no or minimal neutralizing activity when analyzed against the 12-strain global panel, suggesting that they play a limited role in the serum activity of IDC561 ( Figure 1 C; Table S3 A). In contrast, all tested members (23 antibodies) of B cell clone 4 (comprising subclones 4.1–4.4) neutralized 92%–100% of viruses in the screening panel with remarkable potency (GeoMean IC 50 of 0.032–0.198 μg/mL; Figure 1 D; Table S3 A). B cell clone 4, derived from the V H 1-46 and V Κ 3-20 gene segments, included members with different CDRH3 lengths of 18 (subclones 4.1 and 4.2), 20 (subclone 4.4), or 21 (subclone 4.3) amino acids ( Table S1 ). Subclone 4.1 showed the highest breadth and potency and was characterized by a six-amino-acid CDRH1 insertion that lengthened the CDRH1 from 8 to 14 amino acids ( Figure 1 D; Tables S1 and S4 ). We conclude that antibodies of the V H 1-46-derived B cell clone 4 are highly potent, broadly active, and likely mediate the neutralizing serum activity of the elite neutralizer IDC561.
We selected antibodies 561_01_18 and 561_01_55 (hereafter referred to as 1-18 and 1-55), two representative members of clone 4.1, for further analyses ( Figure 2 A). Both antibodies are highly mutated, with heavy and light chain V gene germline nucleotide sequence identities of 68% and 78%–79%, respectively ( Figure 2 A; Table S4 ). Notably, the neutralizing activities of 1-18 and serum IgG of IDC561 against 42 pseudoviruses strongly correlated, suggesting that members of clone 4.1 are main contributors to the serum activity of IDC561 ( Figure S2 A). To determine binding of 1-18 and 1-55 to the BG505 SOSIP.664 trimer in the presence of other HIV-1 bNAbs, we performed competition ELISAs and detected interference with 3BNC117, N6, and VRC01 ( Figures 2 A; S2 B). However, compared with these VRC01-class CD4bs antibodies, a different binding pattern was detected for 1-18 and 1-55 when tested by ELISA against several Env proteins. For example, whereas 3BNC117, N6, and VRC01 bound similarly to YU2 gp120 , YU2 gp140 , and BAL gp140 and were reactive to the V 1 -V 3 loop-deficient gp120 variant RSC3 ( Wu et al., 2010 113. Wu, X. ∙ Yang, Z.Y. ∙ Li, Y. ... Rational design of envelope identifies broadly neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies to HIV-1 Science. 2010; 329 :856-861 Crossref Scopus (1099) PubMed Google Scholar ), bNAbs 1-18 and 1-55 showed lower (YU2 gp120, YU2 gp140 , and BAL gp140 ) or no (RSC3) binding to these proteins ( Figure S2 C). Therefore, 1-18 and 1-55 target the CD4bs but recognize this epitope differently than VRC01-class antibodies.
We next evaluated the neutralizing activity of 1-18 in detail. In comparison with four bNAbs in advanced stages of clinical investigation (3BNC117, VRC01, 10-1074, and PGT121), 1-18 demonstrated superior activity with high potency (GeoMean IC 50 of 0.035 μg/mL, GeoMean IC 80 [80% inhibitory concentration] of 0.155 μg/mL) against all viruses of the 12-strain global screening panel ( deCamp et al., 2014 19. deCamp, A. ∙ Hraber, P. ∙ Bailer, R.T. ... Global panel of HIV-1 Env reference strains for standardized assessments of vaccine-elicited neutralizing antibodies J. Virol. 2014; 88 :2489-2507 Crossref Scopus (122) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 2 B; Table S3 A). Although 1-18 competed with other CD4bs bNAbs for binding to BG505 SOSIP.664 by ELISA, no reduction in neutralizing activity was detected when 1-18 and 3BNC117 were combined ( Figure S2 D). To confirm the results of the screening panel, we evaluated the activity of 1-18 on extended pseudovirus panels. Overall, 1-18 ranked among the best bNAbs that are currently available ( Figure 2 C). When tested against a 119-strain multiclade panel, 1-18 showed highly potent activity (GeoMean IC 50 of 0.048 μg/mL, GeoMean IC 80 of 0.183 μg/mL) with a breadth of 97% ( Figure 2 D; Table S5 A). In addition, 1-18 demonstrated high potency (GeoMean IC 50 of 0.074 μg/mL, GeoMean IC 80 of 0.279 μg/mL) and breadth (90%) when tested against a 100-strain clade C panel ( Table S5 B). Finally, we determined the activity of 1-18 against culture-derived primary HIV-1 strains that are generally more difficult to neutralize than pseudoviruses ( Cohen et al., 2018b 16. Cohen, Y.Z. ∙ Lorenzi, J.C.C. ∙ Seaman, M.S. ... Neutralizing Activity of Broadly Neutralizing Anti-HIV-1 Antibodies against Clade B Clinical Isolates Produced in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells J. Virol. 2018; 92 :e01883-17 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ). Against viruses obtained from 51 HIV-1-infected individuals, 1-18 demonstrated higher breadth and/or potency (GeoMean IC 50 of 0.56 μg/mL, GeoMean IC 80 of 1.57 μg/mL, 96% breadth) than 3BNC117, VRC01, 10-1074, and PGDM1400 ( Figure 2 E; Table S5 C) and was superior to the near-pan-neutralizing V H 1-2-derived CD4bs bNAb N6 ( Huang et al., 2016a 47. Huang, J. ∙ Kang, B.H. ∙ Ishida, E. ... Identification of a CD4-Binding-Site Antibody to HIV that Evolved Near-Pan Neutralization Breadth Immunity. 2016; 45 :1108-1121 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (116) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 2 F; Table S5 C).
We conclude that 1-18 is a highly broad and potent V H 1-46-derived antibody that rivals or exceeds the activity of CD4bs bNAbs described to date.
To characterize Env recognition by the 1-18 family of bNAbs, we solved cryo-EM structures of 1-18 and 1-55 Fabs in complex with soluble native-like Env trimers and the V3-targeting bNAb 10-1074 at resolutions of 2.5 Å (1-18 complexed with BG505 SOSIP.664 ) and 3.9 Å (1-55 complexed with RC1, a designed immunogen that is a derivative of BG505 SOSIP.664 ; Escolano et al., 2019 30. Escolano, A. ∙ Gristick, H.B. ∙ Abernathy, M.E. ... Immunization expands B cells specific to HIV-1 V3 glycan in mice and macaques Nature. 2019; 570 :468-473 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures 3 A and S3 ; Table S6 ). Notably, at 2.5-Å resolution, the 1-18 complex is the highest resolution view yet obtained of an HIV-1 Env trimer ( Figure S3 A; Table S6 ). Both complexes contained three 1-18 family Fabs and three 10-1074 Fabs interacting with three-fold symmetry with a SOSIP-Env trimer. 1-18 and 1-55 recognized the CD4bs similarly to other V H 1-46-derived bNAbs, including 8ANC131 and CH235.12 ( Bonsignori et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2015 8. Bonsignori, M. ∙ Zhou, T. ∙ Sheng, Z. ..., NISC Comparative Sequencing Program Maturation Pathway from Germline to Broad HIV-1 Neutralizer of a CD4-Mimic Antibody Cell. 2016; 165 :449-463 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (138) PubMed Google Scholar 125.

However, in addition, 1-18 contacts Env by residue F54 HC , which is buried in the gp120 ‘Phe43 pocket’, and by residue R64 HC , which makes a salt bridge with V5 residue D457 gp120 ( Figure S4 B). These interactions mimic analogous gp120 contacts made by CD4 residues F43 CD4 and K35 CD4 , respectively, and the V H 1-2-derived bNAb N6 also buries an aromatic residue (Y54 HC ) in the ‘Phe43 pocket’ ( Huang et al., 2016a; Kwong et al., 1998 47.

Structure of an HIV gp120 envelope glycoprotein in complex with the CD4 receptor and a neutralizing human antibody Nature. 1998; 393 :648-659 Crossref Scopus (2341) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure S4 B).
In addition to the canonical V H 1-46 contacts, 1-18 contains a six-residue insertion in its CDRH1, resulting in a negatively charged 25 DDDPYTDDD 33 motif that interacts with the adjacent gp120 protomer ( Figures 3 B–3D). At the adjacent protomer, four Asp residues in the 1-18 CDRH1 (D25 HC , D27 HC , D31 HC , and D32 HC ) plus T30 HC form coordinated interactions around the highly conserved Env residue K207 gp120 ( Figure 3 C). In addition, the increased length of the 1-18 CDRH1 places Y29 HC in a position to interact with residues in the V3 loop on the adjacent protomer (S306 gp120 , R308 gp120 , A316 gp120 , and Y318 gp120 ) ( Figure 3 C). Although not all of the Asp residues in the 1-18 CDRH1 contact positively charged residues on gp120, the Asp-rich insertion may have been selected to carry an overall negative charge that is electrostatically attracted to the positively charged patch within the V3 loop on the adjacent protomer ( Figure 3 D), which could drive formation of an initial Env-antibody complex ( Schreiber et al., 1996 92. Schreiber, M. ∙ Wachsmuth, C. ∙ Müller, H. ... Loss of antibody reactivity directed against the V3 domain of certain human immunodeficiency virus type 1 variants during disease progression J. Gen. Virol. 1996; 77 :2403-2414 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Although other CD4bs bNAbs include Asp-containing insertions in either the CDRH1 or heavy-chain framework region 3 (FWRH3) that interact with the positively charged gp120 patch ( Lee et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2018 60.

Med. 2018; 24 :857-867 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure S4 C), the number of Asp in the CDRH1 of 1-18 and the extent of their interaction to Env have not been described before. Notably, gp120 residues contacted by the 1-18 CDRH1 contribute to the CD4 and/or co-receptor binding sites ( Liu et al., 2017; Rizzuto et al., 1998; Shaik et al., 2019 62.

Structural basis of coreceptor recognition by HIV-1 envelope spike Nature. 2019; 565 :318-323 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ), and most residues are highly conserved ( Figure 3 C). Demonstrating their importance for viral function, mutations in some of these residues have been shown to substantially reduce infectivity ( de Taeye et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2017 18. de Taeye, S.W. ∙ Ozorowski, G. ∙ Torrents de la Peña, A. ...

To evaluate the relevance of the CDRH1 insertion for the neutralizing activity of 1-18, we engineered 1-18Δins, a 1-18 variant lacking the insertion. When tested against the 12-strain global panel, 1-18Δins showed significantly reduced potency compared with 1-18 (GeoMean IC 50 values of 0.114 μg/mL [1-18Δins] and 0.035 μg/mL [1-18], respectively; p = 0.012; Table S3 B). In addition, we investigated antibody 561_02_12 (referred to as 2-12), a member of clone 4 that developed in individual IDC561 but does not have a CDRH1 insertion. Compared with 1-18, antibody 2-12 showed lower breadth on extended pseudovirus panels (119-strain multiclade panel: 1-18, 97% breadth; 2-12, 87% breadth; 100-strain clade C panel: 1-18, 90% breadth; 2-12, 74% breadth; Tables S5 A and S5B). Analysis of the neutralization panel data ( West et al., 2013 111. West, Jr., A.P. ∙ Scharf, L. ∙ Horwitz, J. ... Computational analysis of anti-HIV-1 antibody neutralization panel data to identify potential functional epitope residues Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110 :10598-10603 Crossref Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar ) indicated reduced potency of 2-12 against viruses carrying H364 gp120 in the CD4 binding loop. In contrast, 1-18 is less affected by this variation, suggesting a higher tolerance for structural variations in this site.
Compared with the epitopes of the CD4bs bNAbs 3BNC117 and VRC01 ( Lee et al., 2017; Stewart-Jones et al., 2016 60. Lee, J.H. ∙ Andrabi, R. ∙ Su, C.Y. ...

Trimeric HIV-1-Env Structures Define Glycan Shields from Clades A, B, and G Cell. 2016; 165 :813-826 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ), 1-18 and 1-55 bury more surface area on both the primary gp120 epitope and the adjacent protomer, another potential mechanism for their increased breadth and potency ( Chuang et al., 2019 13. Chuang, G.Y. ∙ Zhou, J. ∙ Acharya, P. ...

Finally, the slightly higher neutralizing activity of 1-18 compared with 1-55 might be explained by variations in glycan accommodation ( Figure S4 D). We conclude that 1-18 mediates exceptional HIV-1-neutralizing activity by an increase in buried surface on gp120, primarily through increased inter-protomer contacts mediated by its unique CDRH1.
To determine how known Env escape mutations affect the neutralizing activity of 1-18, we evaluated the sensitivity of HIV-1 YU2 pseudovirus variants. As expected, removal of potential N -linked glycosylation sites (PNGSs) in the V2 (N160 gp120 ) and V3 (N301 gp120 , N332 gp120 ) loops mediated resistance to the V1/V2-directed bNAbs PG16 and PDGM1400 and the V3-directed bNAbs 10-1074 and PGT128, respectively ( Mouquet et al., 2012; Pejchal et al., 2011; Sok et al., 2014; Walker et al., 2009, 2011 71.

Similarly, removal of a PNGS adjacent to the CD4bs (N276 gp120 ) reduced sensitivity to the gp120-gp41 interface bNAb 8ANC195 ( Scharf et al., 2014 86. Scharf, L. ∙ Scheid, J.F. ∙ Lee, J.H. ... Antibody 8ANC195 reveals a site of broad vulnerability on the HIV-1 envelope spike Cell Rep. 2014; 7 :785-795 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (146) PubMed Google Scholar ) but had no effect on 1-18 ( Figure 4 ).
V H -restricted CD4bs bNAbs typically interact with loop D residues N279 gp120 and/or N280 gp120 , and changes in these residues have been associated with viral rebound from CD4bs therapy ( Diskin et al., 2013; Horwitz et al., 2013; Julg et al., 2017; Klein et al., 2012; Lynch et al., 2015a 24.

Med. 2015; 7 :319ra206 Crossref Scopus (198) PubMed Google Scholar ). When we tested HIV-1 YU2 variants with mutations at these residues, we observed reduced or abrogated sensitivity to VRC01-class bNAbs and to the V H 1-46-derived CD4bs bNAb 8ANC131 ( Figure 4 ). In contrast, these mutations had no or only minimal effects on 1-18 ( Figure 4 ). Maintained neutralizing activity against these variants might be mediated by increased contacts of 1-18’s extended CDRH1 that formed compensatory interactions, alleviating the necessity for loop D contacts normally required by CD4bs antibodies. Additionally, the portion of 1-18’s CDRL3 that contacts loop D utilizes a glycine-rich 92 GGT 94 motif rather than the 92 SST 94 motif in 8ANC131. This could accommodate mutations in loop D (N279K, N280Y) through increased flexibility. Finally, the 7-Å shift in CDRL2 location between 1-18 and 8ANC131 could allow greater accommodation of a glycan at N279 gp120 in two HIV-1 YU2 variants (A281T and T278I/A281T).
Mutations in the β23 and β24 strands surrounding the V5 loop (gp120 residues 451-471) were associated with viral resistance against 8ANC131 but were tolerated by 1-18 ( Figure 4 ). V5 loop residue D457 gp120 interacts with 1-18 R64 HC , a somatic mutation from the V H 1-46 germline that is present in 1-18 but not in 8ANC131. We hypothesize that the R64 HC -D457 gp120 salt bridge is a crucial interaction between 1-18 and gp120 that potentially allows it to tolerate common routes of Env escape within the V5 loop.
We conclude that 1-18 maintains full activity against viruses carrying mutations associated with viral resistance against other CD4bs bNAbs in vitro .
To identify potential pathways of viral escape from 1-18, we used mutational antigenic profiling with libraries of HIV-1 BG505 variants containing all single amino acid substitutions within the ecto- and transmembrane domains of Env ( Figure S5 ; Dingens et al., 2017; Haddox et al., 2018 21. Dingens, A.S. ∙ Haddox, H.K. ∙ Overbaugh, J. ... Comprehensive Mapping of HIV-1 Escape from a Broadly Neutralizing Antibody Cell Host Microbe. 2017; 21 :777-787.e4 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar 42. Haddox, H.K. ∙ Dingens, A.S. ∙ Hilton, S.K. ... Mapping mutational effects along the evolutionary landscape of HIV envelope eLife. 2018; 7 :e34420 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). In this assay, the effects of Env mutations on antibody resistance are quantitatively determined by deep sequencing of cells that become infected in the presence versus the absence of an antibody.
1-18 only selected escape mutants at a small number of residues, all of which were outside of the canonical CD4bs. In contrast to 3BNC117 and VRC01 ( Dingens et al., 2019 22. Dingens, A.S. ∙ Arenz, D. ∙ Weight, H. ... An Antigenic Atlas of HIV-1 Escape from Broadly Neutralizing Antibodies Distinguishes Functional and Structural Epitopes Immunity. 2019; 50 :520-532.e3 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ), we observed no statistically significant escape from 1-18 in loop D and the CD4 binding loop ( Figures 5 A–5C and S5 ). Rather, 1-18-mediated selection was localized to the V3 loop and the stem of the V1/V2 loop of gp120 ( Figure 5 C). Among the four sites of significant escape, three residues (K207 gp120 , R304 gp120 , and Y318 gp120 ) interact with the CDRH1 of 1-18 ( Figure 5 C). The fourth residue, C119 gp120 , generally forms a disulfide bond with C205 gp120 at the stem of the V1/V2 loop. Thus, mutations at residue C119 gp120 may reduce 1-18 accessibility to the highly conserved K207 gp120 by disordering the V1/V2 loop structure ( Leonard et al., 1990; van Anken et al., 2008 61.

Only five of 10 strictly conserved disulfide bonds are essential for folding and eight for function of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19 :4298-4309 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ).
Mutational antigenic profiling allows identification of the strongest escape mutations for each antibody ( Figures 5 A–5C and S5 E). Importantly, although VRC01 escape mutations were associated with a 3- to more than 175-fold increase in the antibody IC 50 values for HIV-1 BG505 pseudovirus variants ( Dingens et al., 2019 22. Dingens, A.S. ∙ Arenz, D. ∙ Weight, H. ... An Antigenic Atlas of HIV-1 Escape from Broadly Neutralizing Antibodies Distinguishes Functional and Structural Epitopes Immunity. 2019; 50 :520-532.e3 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ), the effects were much less pronounced for potential 1-18 escape mutants ( Figure 5 D). When we evaluated HIV-1 BG505 pseudoviruses carrying single mutations at the six residues with the highest level of 1-18-mediated selection, the sensitivity to 1-18 was reduced by less than 2.3-fold for 5 of the 6 tested viruses ( Figure 5 D). The sixth virus, carrying an A316E mutation, showed a 3.2-fold decrease in sensitivity (IC 50 increased to 0.098 μg/mL) ( Figure 5 D). Therefore, all tested potential escape variants remained highly 1-18-sensitive when evaluated as pseudoviruses. To determine the ease of viral escape, we compared the effects of the 40 strongest mutations from antigenic profiling of 1-18 with those of VRC01, 3BNC117, 10-1074, or the combination of 3BNC117 and 10-1074 ( Dingens et al., 2019 22. Dingens, A.S. ∙ Arenz, D. ∙ Weight, H. ... An Antigenic Atlas of HIV-1 Escape from Broadly Neutralizing Antibodies Distinguishes Functional and Structural Epitopes Immunity. 2019; 50 :520-532.e3 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ). The levels of escape observed for 1-18 were lower than those for the single bNAbs and similar to the combination of 3BNC117 and 10-1074 ( Figure 5 E).
Overall, mutational antigenic profiling of 1-18 revealed a strong limitation of HIV-1 BG505 escape via single amino acid mutations, with no evidence of selection at the canonical CD4bs that is critical for resistance against VRC01-class bNAbs.
To determine the antiviral activity of 1-18 in vivo , we used HIV-1 YU2 -infected humanized mice that can maintain stable viremia with a rate of HIV-1 diversification similar to what is observed in humans ( Gruell and Klein, 2017; Ince et al., 2010; Klein et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2002 38.

Virol. 2002; 76 :6332-6343 Crossref Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure S6 A).
Following a 1-mg loading dose of antibody administered subcutaneously (s.c.), we treated HIV-1 YU2 -infected mice (n = 6–10 per group) twice a week with s.c. injections of 0.5 mg per bNAb for 4–8 weeks ( Figure 6 A). Treatment with 3BNC117, VRC01, or the combination of both bNAbs resulted in mean viral load reductions of 0.5, 0.5, and 0.7 log 10 copies/mL, respectively. However, these effects were only transient, and viral rebound occurred within the first 2 weeks in most animals, indicating rapid viral escape ( Figure 6 A). Indeed, when plasma single-genome sequencing (SGS) ( Salazar-Gonzalez et al., 2008 82. Salazar-Gonzalez, J.F. ∙ Bailes, E. ∙ Pham, K.T. ... Deciphering human immunodeficiency virus type 1 transmission and early envelope diversification by single-genome amplification and sequencing J. Virol. 2008; 82 :3952-3970 Crossref Scopus (426) PubMed Google Scholar ) was performed at week 4 after the start of treatment, 79 of 82 isolated viruses from 16 mice showed mutations in the VRC01 and 3BNC117 target sites in loop D and/or the β23/V5 loop regions of gp120 ( Figures 6 B and 7 A; Tables S7 A–S7C).
In contrast to the transient effects of 3BNC117 and VRC01, monotherapy of HIV-1 YU2 -infected humanized mice with 1-18 resulted in sustained viral suppression over a period of 8 weeks in all treated animals (average drop of 1.7 log 10 copies/mL; Figure 6 A). Moreover, in all but one mouse, viremia dropped to levels below the level of quantitation (384 copies/mL) by day 35. From the one mouse (1069) that had quantifiable levels of viremia but was suppressed (drop of 1.9 log 10 copies/mL), we analyzed HIV-1 env sequences at week 4 ( Figures 6 A and 6B). We detected no recurrent mutations at contact residues of 1-18 or typical CD4bs bNAbs, and pseudoviruses derived from these sequences remained sensitive to 1-18 ( Figure 6 B; Table S7 D). These results were confirmed in an independent repeat experiment for 1-18 as well as for 1-55, another member of clone 4.1 ( Figure S6 B). Although five of six 1-18-treated mice in this experiment were fully suppressed, one mouse (1730) continued to show high HIV-1 RNA copy numbers ( Figure S6 B). However, all env sequences obtained from this mouse carried large V4 loop deletions as well as early stop codons ( Figure S6 C). Thus, despite detectable rebound of viremia in 1 of 18 mice treated with 1-18 or 1-55, no functional escape viruses were observed by SGS and evaluation of pseudoviruses.
Effective clinical application of bNAbs depends on favorable safety and pharmacokinetic profiles. Following a single injection of 1-18 or 1-55, their decline in serum of immunodeficient mice was slower compared with VRC01-class bNAbs and more similar to 10-1074, which has a longer half-life than 3BNC117 and VRC01 in humans ( Bar-On et al., 2018; Caskey et al., 2015, 2017; Ledgerwood et al., 2015; Lynch et al., 2015a; Mendoza et al., 2018 5.

Combination therapy with anti-HIV-1 antibodies maintains viral suppression Nature. 2018; 561 :479-484 Crossref Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure S6 D). In addition, whereas some bNAbs demonstrate binding to self-antigens ( Haynes et al., 2005 43. Haynes, B.F. ∙ Fleming, J. ∙ St Clair, E.W. ... Cardiolipin polyspecific autoreactivity in two broadly neutralizing HIV-1 antibodies Science. 2005; 308 :1906-1908 Crossref Scopus (579) PubMed Google Scholar ), we found no indication for autoreactivity of 1-18 or 1-55 when tested against HEp-2 cells ( Figure S6 E).
In summary, we conclude that 1-18 has exceptional antiviral in vivo activity against HIV-1 YU2 . This activity is superior to the CD4bs antibodies 3BNC117 and VRC01, which are currently being evaluated in clinical trials. Importantly, single bNAb therapy with 1-18 is sufficient to effectively prevent development of viral escape variants that rapidly emerge during HIV-1 YU2 monotherapy with other bNAbs ( Horwitz et al., 2013; Klein et al., 2012 44. Horwitz, J.A. ∙ Halper-Stromberg, A. ∙ Mouquet, H. ... HIV-1 suppression and durable control by combining single broadly neutralizing antibodies and antiretroviral drugs in humanized mice Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110 :16538-16543 Crossref Scopus (167) PubMed Google Scholar 53. Klein, F. ∙ Halper-Stromberg, A. ∙ Horwitz, J.A. ... HIV therapy by a combination of broadly neutralizing antibodies in humanized mice Nature. 2012; 492 :118-122 Crossref Scopus (331) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To confirm that mutations occurring during 3BNC117 and/or VRC01 therapy conferred antibody resistance, we generated 30 pseudoviruses derived from day 28 env sequences of 11 VRC01-class-treated mice. We found 23 viral variants that were fully resistant to the administered antibodies (IC 50 > 25 μg/mL) or showed increased VRC01-class resistance (>5-fold increase in IC 50 values). Notably, however, all of these pseudoviruses remained sensitive to 1-18 in vitro ( Figure 7 B; Table S7 ).
To determine whether 1-18 can overcome escape from VRC01-class bNAbs in vivo , we added bNAb 1-18 therapy (1-mg loading dose s.c. followed by 0.5 mg s.c. twice weekly) to 3BNC117- and/or VRC01-pretreated animals while continuing 3BNC117 and/or VRC01 administrations ( Figure 7 C). Despite circulating VRC01-class-resistant viral variants, 1-18 effectively reduced viremia and maintained viral suppression in 17 of 18 mice ( Figure 7 C). Following interruption of bNAb therapy, viral rebound occurred in all fully suppressed mice when Env-reactive antibody plasma concentrations declined to a median of 0.1 μg/mL ( Figure 7 D). To determine whether declining 1-18 levels resulted in selection of 1-18-resistant escape variants, we performed plasma SGS of rebound viruses 8 weeks after treatment interruption (day 114) ( Figure 7 E). Although we found novel mutations compared with day 0 and day 28 in 39 of 60 sequences from 12 mice, there was no recurrent pattern of mutations that developed after 1-18 therapy ( Figure 7 E). Indeed, all 20 sequences tested as pseudoviruses were demonstrated to be fully sensitive to 1-18 ( Figure 7 E; Table S7 ).
We conclude that bNAb 1-18 effectively overcomes VRC01-class resistance in vivo and maintains viral suppression without the development of 1-18-resistant HIV-1 YU2 variants.

Section: Discussion

Implementation of HIV-1-neutralizing antibodies for clinical practice requires antibodies with specific characteristics. These include safety, a favorable pharmacokinetic profile, and broad and highly potent neutralizing activity to effectively target the remarkable diversity of HIV-1 ( Caskey et al., 2019 11. Caskey, M. ∙ Klein, F. ∙ Nussenzweig, M.C. Broadly neutralizing anti-HIV-1 monoclonal antibodies in the clinic Nat. Med. 2019; 25 :547-553 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, as for any drug against HIV-1, viral escape represents one of the biggest challenges for clinical application. This became evident when (1) single bNAbs were used for therapy and HIV-1 resistance developed within a few weeks ( Bar et al., 2016; Caskey et al., 2015, 2017; Klein et al., 2012; Lynch et al., 2015a; Scheid et al., 2016 4.

HIV-1 antibody 3BNC117 suppresses viral rebound in humans during treatment interruption Nature. 2016; 535 :556-560 Crossref Scopus (185) PubMed Google Scholar ), and (2) antibody combinations resulted in improved viral control by preventing early development of resistance ( Bar-On et al., 2018; Klein et al., 2012; Mendoza et al., 2018 5. Bar-On, Y. ∙ Gruell, H. ∙ Schoofs, T. ... Safety and antiviral activity of combination HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies in viremic individuals Nat.

Mendoza, P. ∙ Gruell, H. ∙ Nogueira, L. ... Combination therapy with anti-HIV-1 antibodies maintains viral suppression Nature. 2018; 561 :479-484 Crossref Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, restriction of HIV-1 escape will be an antibody-dependent feature of utmost importance for successful bNAb applications.
VRC01-class antibodies targeting the functionally critical CD4bs have broad and potent neutralizing activity but fail to prevent viral escape in vivo ( Bar et al., 2016; Caskey et al., 2015; Horwitz et al., 2013; Klein et al., 2012; Lynch et al., 2015a; Scheid et al., 2016 4.

HIV-1 antibody 3BNC117 suppresses viral rebound in humans during treatment interruption Nature. 2016; 535 :556-560 Crossref Scopus (185) PubMed Google Scholar ). Through a combination of functional in vitro mapping and in vivo therapy of HIV-1-infected humanized mice, we demonstrated that the V H 1-46-derived CD4bs bNAb 1-18 effectively restricts development of HIV-1 resistance. Contrasting other CD4bs bNAbs, we did not identify single amino acid mutations resulting in 1-18 resistance in two viral strains of different clades (BG505, clade A; YU2, clade B). Most importantly, in the setting of viral replication and diversification in HIV-1 YU2 -infected humanized mice, 1-18 monotherapy resulted in effective and sustained viral suppression. Notably, the in vivo activity of 1-18 was not affected by VRC01-class-resistant viral variants. Thus, despite mutations in up to two sites associated with escape from CD4bs antibodies, 1-18 effectively suppressed viremia and restricted the development of additional escape mutations.
In our cryo-EM analysis of a 1-18-BG505 complex, the highest-resolution HIV-1 Env trimer structure obtained to date (2.5 Å), the details of 1-18 recognition of Env were determined. The structure demonstrated that 1-18 combines favorable features found in potent V H 1-2 bNAbs that likely contribute to its exceptional potency and breadth. These characteristics include (1) an aromatic residue that mimics residue Phe43 of CD4 to target the ‘Phe43 gp120 pocket’, as seen in bNAb N6 ( Huang et al., 2016a 47. Huang, J. ∙ Kang, B.H. ∙ Ishida, E. ... Identification of a CD4-Binding-Site Antibody to HIV that Evolved Near-Pan Neutralization Breadth Immunity. 2016; 45 :1108-1121 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (116) PubMed Google Scholar ); (2) contacts with the adjacent gp120 protomer, as seen for bNAb 3BNC117 ( Lee et al., 2017; Lyumkis et al., 2013 60. Lee, J.H. ∙ Andrabi, R. ∙ Su, C.Y. ... A Broadly Neutralizing Antibody Targets the Dynamic HIV Envelope Trimer Apex via a Long, Rigidified, and Anionic β-Hairpin Structure Immunity. 2017; 46 :690-702 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar 66. Lyumkis, D. ∙ Julien, J.P. ∙ de Val, N. ... Cryo-EM structure of a fully glycosylated soluble cleaved HIV-1 envelope trimer Science. 2013; 342 :1484-1490 Crossref Scopus (445) PubMed Google Scholar ) but with increased buried surface area (via its six-residue insertion in CDRH1); and (3) a larger buried surface area on gp120 than other V H 1-2 bNAbs: 1,530 Å 2 compared with 1,260 Å 2 (VRC01) and 1,290 Å 2 (3BNC117). Finally, 1-18’s unique mode of binding enables it to make additional contacts with conserved residues on gp120 not found in other CD4bs bNAbs, allowing 1-18 to rely less on classical CD4bs bNAb contacts and making viral escape more difficult. These characteristics may explain 1-18’s exceptional potency, breadth, and resistance to viral escape. Notably, functional antigenic mapping demonstrated that 1-18-mediated selection was focused on contact residues within the CDRH1. Moreover, the lack of the CDRH1 insertion in antibodies 1-18Δins and 2-12 was associated with reduced neutralizing activity compared with 1-18.
Despite the remarkable neutralization breadth of 1-18 (covering 256 of 271 evaluated primary viruses and pseudoviruses), a small number of viruses was found to be 1-18 resistant. However, sequence analysis ( West et al., 2013 111. West, Jr., A.P. ∙ Scharf, L. ∙ Horwitz, J. ... Computational analysis of anti-HIV-1 antibody neutralization panel data to identify potential functional epitope residues Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110 :10598-10603 Crossref Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar ) did not identify single residues that were associated with 1-18 resistance. In addition, we analyzed viruses from individual IDC561, from whom 1-18 was identified. Although viremia was controlled in the absence of ART for more than 15 years, it was detectable by the time of 1-18 isolation. Indeed, viruses obtained at this time showed resistance against 1-18 and clonal members ( Figure S7 ). Remarkably, however, their CD4bs sequences presented with highly infrequent amino acid residues ( Figure S7 ). For example, among 2,351 clade B env sequences in the Los Alamos HIV Sequence Database, only 0.8% carried a glycine at the loop D residue 281 gp120 , and not a single virus had a glutamic acid at position 474 gp120 ( Figure S7 ). Similarly, uncommon amino acids were found in other loop D (282 gp120 ) and V5 loop (471 gp120 ) positions as well as at residue 208 gp120 , which neighbors K207 gp120 that strongly interacts with the CDRH1 of 1-18 ( Figure S7 ). Taking the results from profiling escape pathways in vitro together with the lack of viral escape in humanized mouse experiments, the occurrence of multiple uncommon amino acid residues in 1-18-resistant viruses suggests a restricted escape pathway from 1-18 that may require accumulation of multiple rare mutations.
Current strategies to combine bNAbs are based on the use of antibodies targeting non-overlapping epitopes ( Bar-On et al., 2018; Barouch et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2016b; Klein et al., 2012; Mendoza et al., 2018; Shingai et al., 2013; Xu et al., 2017 5.

Xu, L. ∙ Pegu, A. ∙ Rao, E. ... Trispecific broadly neutralizing HIV antibodies mediate potent SHIV protection in macaques Science. 2017; 358 :85-90 Crossref Scopus (115) PubMed Google Scholar ). To this end, the combination of 1-18 with bNAbs targeting other epitopes (e.g., the MPER antibody DH511.2_K3, which neutralizes 100% of tested clade C viruses; Williams et al., 2017 112. Williams, L.D. ∙ Ofek, G. ∙ Schätzle, S. ... Potent and broad HIV-neutralizing antibodies in memory B cells and plasma Sci. Immunol. 2017; 2 :eaal2200 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) may be a promising option. Because the most potent known CD4bs bNAbs are of the VRC01-class, synergistic effects by combinations of these antibodies are not expected. However, given their different binding, neutralization, and escape patterns, a combination of 1-18 with VRC01-class CD4bs bNAbs may be highly beneficial. The capacity of 1-18 to overcome VRC01-class escape mutations in vivo as well as a calculated breadth of more than 99% when 1-18 is combined with VRC01-class bNAbs (e.g., N6 or 3BNC117) offers new possibilities of bNAb combinations, such as a dual anti-CD4bs therapy. Finally, CD4bs bNAbs have been demonstrated to induce escape variants with reduced viral fitness ( Lynch et al., 2015b; Otsuka et al., 2018; Sather et al., 2012 65. Lynch, R.M. ∙ Wong, P. ∙ Tran, L. ... HIV-1 fitness cost associated with escape from the VRC01 class of CD4 binding site neutralizing antibodies J.

Virol. 2012; 86 :12676-12685 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ). Applying double CD4bs-targeting pressure may force the virus to more extensively mutate this functionally critical epitope and, therefore, result in impaired viral variants and prolonged viral control.
In summary, by combining outstanding neutralizing activity and a high barrier for viral escape, 1-18 provides a new option for highly effective treatment and prevention of HIV-1 infection.

Further information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the Lead Contact, Florian Klein ( florian.klein@uk-koeln.de ). Nucleotide sequences of all generated antibodies were deposited at GenBank, and expression plasmids for 1-18, 1-55, 2-12, and clonal members will be shared upon request.
Blood and leukapheresis samples were obtained under protocols approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Cologne (protocols 13-364 and 16-054) and the local IRBs. All participants provided written informed consent. Participants of the neutralization screening cohort are recruited at hospitals and/or private practices in Germany (Cologne, Essen, and Frankfurt), Cameroon (Yaoundé), Nepal (Kathmandu), and Tanzania (Mbeya). At the time of leukapheresis, IDC561 was a 48-year-old male who was diagnosed with HIV-1 infection 21 years earlier. He was recruited at the University Hospital Cologne. PBMCs for bulk viral outgrowth cultures were obtained from individuals recruited in Germany (Cologne).
NOD.Cg- Rag1 tm1mom Il2rg tm1Wjl /SzJ (NRG) mice were purchased at The Jackson Laboratory and bred and maintained at the Decentralized Animal Husbandry Network (Dezentrales Tierhaltungsnetzwerk) of the University of Cologne under specific pathogen-free (SPF) conditions with 12-hour light/dark cycles. For breeding purposes, mice were provided with ssniff 1124 breeding feed; for experimental purposes, mice were provided with ssniff 1543 maintenance feed. Humanized mice were generated as previously described with modifications ( Klein et al., 2012 53. Klein, F. ∙ Halper-Stromberg, A. ∙ Horwitz, J.A. ... HIV therapy by a combination of broadly neutralizing antibodies in humanized mice Nature. 2012; 492 :118-122 Crossref Scopus (331) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, human CD34 + hematopoietic stem cells were isolated from cord blood and perfused placental tissues using CD34 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec). Collection of cord blood and placental tissues was conducted under a protocol approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Cologne (16-110), and all donors provided written informed consent. NRG mice were sublethally irradiated within 5 days of birth and intrahepatically injected with purified human CD34 + stem cells 4 to 6 hours later. Success of humanization was determined approximately 12 weeks later by FACS analysis of blood for human PBMCs. All mouse experiments were authorized by the State Agency for Nature, Environmental Protection, and Consumer Protection North Rhine-Westphalia (LANUV).
HEK293T cells (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained at 37°C and 5% CO 2 in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Thermo Fisher) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Sigma-Aldrich), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 1x antibiotic-antimycotic (all from Thermo Fisher). TZM-bl cells ( Platt et al., 1998 76. Platt, E.J. ∙ Wehrly, K. ∙ Kuhmann, S.E. ... Effects of CCR5 and CD4 cell surface concentrations on infections by macrophagetropic isolates of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 J.

Expi293 cells (Thermo Fisher) were maintained at 37°C and 8% CO 2 in Expi293 Expression medium (Thermo Fisher) and kept under constant shaking at 130 rpm. CHO cells were maintained at 37°C and 5% CO2 in ProCHO-5 media (Lonza) supplemented with 0.1 M HEPES, 1x GlutaMAX, 1x MEM NEAA, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and 0.5 mg/ml hygromycin B (all from Thermo Fisher). SupT1-R5 cells ( Didigu et al., 2014 20. Didigu, C.A. ∙ Wilen, C.B. ∙ Wang, J. ...

The sex of HEK293T, TZM-bl, 293-6E, Expi293, and CHO cell lines is female, and the sex of SupT1-R5 cells is male. Cell lines were not specifically authenticated.
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated by density-gradient centrifugation and stored at −150°C in 90% FBS and 10% DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich) until further use. Plasma and serum samples were stored at −80°C until further use.
Serum and plasma samples were heat-inactivated (56°C for 40 min) and incubated with Protein G Sepharose (GE Life Sciences) overnight at 4°C. IgGs were eluted from Protein G in chromatography columns using 0.1 M glycine (pH = 3.0) and buffered in 1 M Tris (pH = 8.0). Subsequently, buffer exchange to PBS and antibody concentration was performed using Amicon 30 kDa spin membranes (Millipore). Purified IgGs were stored at 4°C until further use.
B cells were isolated from PBMCs using the Pan B Cell Isolation Kit, B Cell Isolation Kit II, or IgG + Memory B Cell Isolation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec). Isolated cells were labeled with anti-human CD19-AF700 (BD), anti-human IgG-APC (BD), DAPI (Thermo Fisher), and the respective HIV-1 Env bait for 30 minutes on ice. BG505 SOSIP.664 -GFP or biotinylated YU2 gp140 that was labeled with Streptavidin-PE (BD) were used as HIV-1 Env baits. Env-reactive CD19 + IgG + DAPI - single cells were sorted into 96-well plates containing 4 μl of lysis buffer (0.5x PBS, 10 mM DTT (Thermo Fisher), 2 U/μl RNasin (Promega), and 1 U/μl RNaseOUT (Thermo Fisher)) per well using a BD FACSAria Fusion. Plates were stored at −80°C until further use.
Sorted cells were incubated with 0.75 μl Random Hexamer Primer (Thermo Fisher), 0.5 μl NP-40 (Thermo Fisher), and 5.6 μl RNase-free H 2 O for 1 min at 65°C. Subsequently, 3 μl of 5x RT Buffer (Thermo Fisher), 0.5 μl dNTPs mix (25 mM, Thermo Fisher), 1 μl DTT (100 mM, Sigma Aldrich), 2.05 μl of RNase-free H 2 O, 0.1 μl RNasin (40 U/μl, Promega), 0.1 μl RNaseOUT (40 U/μl, Promega), and 0.25 μl Superscript IV (200 U/μl, Thermo Fisher) were added and samples were incubated at 42°C for 10 min, 25°C for 10 min, 50°C for 10 min, and 94°C for 5 min. Antibody sequences for single cell analysis were amplified by semi-nested PCRs using Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase or Platinum Taq Green Hot Start DNA Polymerase (Thermo Fisher) and previously described primers, including the novel OPT5/oPR-primer set optimized for detection of highly mutated IgG sequences ( Kreer et al., 2019 54. Kreer, C. ∙ Döring, M. ∙ Lehnen, N. ... openPrimeR for multiplex amplification of highly diverse templates bioRxiv. 2019; Crossref Google Scholar ), using the OPT5/oPR-primer mix and CG_RT 5′-AGGTGTGCACGCCGCTGGTC ( Ozawa et al., 2006 73. Ozawa, T. ∙ Kishi, H. ∙ Muraguchi, A. Amplification and analysis of cDNA generated from a single cell by 5′-RACE: application to isolation of antibody heavy and light chain variable gene sequences from single B cells Biotechniques. 2006; 40 :469-470, 472, 474 passim Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ) for the 1 st PCR, and the OPT5/oPR-primer mix and IgG_Internal RT 5′-GTTCGGGGAAGTAGTCCTTGAC ( Tiller et al., 2008 102. Tiller, T. ∙ Meffre, E. ∙ Yurasov, S. ... Efficient generation of monoclonal antibodies from single human B cells by single cell RT-PCR and expression vector cloning J. Immunol. Methods. 2008; 329 :112-124 Crossref Scopus (444) PubMed Google Scholar ) for the 2 nd PCR. First-round PCR was run at 94°C for 2 min; followed by 50 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 55 s. Second-round PCR was run at 94°C for 2 min; followed by 50 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 45 s. Second-round PCR products were sequenced by Sanger sequencing and used for further sequence analyses.
Sequences with a mean Phred score ≥ 28 and a minimal length of 240 nucleotides were annotated with IgBLAST ( Ye et al., 2013 117. Ye, J. ∙ Ma, N. ∙ Madden, T.L. ... IgBLAST: an immunoglobulin variable domain sequence analysis tool Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41 :W34-40 Crossref Scopus (297) PubMed Google Scholar ) and trimmed from framework region (FWR) 1 of the variable region to the end of the J gene. Base calls with a Phred score < 16 were masked and sequences with > 15 masked nucleotides, frameshifts, or stop codons were excluded from further analyses. To analyze the sequences for potential clonalities, all productive heavy chain sequences were grouped by identical V genes and the pairwise Levenshtein distance of their CDRH3s was determined. Individual sequences were grouped into clones when they shared the same V gene and had a minimal CDRH3 identity of 75%. After 10 rounds with a randomized input of sequences, the result that yielded the lowest number of unassigned (non-clonal) sequences was selected for further analyses. All clones were re-validated manually by the investigators in order to identify shared mutations. Sequences that were initially assigned to different clones but shared the same VDJ genes and amino acid and/or silent nucleotide mutations were subsequently grouped into subclones. Nucleotide sequence identity to germline was calculated using IgBLAST. The maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree in Figure 1 D was generated using nucleotide sequences of heavy-chain V genes (FWRH1-FWRH3) of subclones 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4 (n = 86 sequences) and of the IGHV1-46 ∗ 01 Homo sapiens allele (GenBank X92343.1 ). All sequences were aligned using ClustalW (Geneious R10; cost matrix: IUB; gap open cost: 15; gap extend cost: 6.66) and the maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree was calculated using PhyML with 1,000 bootstrap replicates ( Guindon et al., 2010 40. Guindon, S. ∙ Dufayard, J.F. ∙ Lefort, V. ... New algorithms and methods to estimate maximum-likelihood phylogenies: assessing the performance of PhyML 3.0 Syst. Biol. 2010; 59 :307-321 Crossref Scopus (7702) PubMed Google Scholar ) (substitution model: general time reversible [GTR]; Geneious R10). The best-scoring tree was then rooted to IGHV1-46 ∗ 01.
For cloning of single cell-derived antibodies, the 1 st PCR product of single cell-PCR was used as template and amplified using Q5 Hot Start High Fidelity DNA Polymerase (New England Biolabs) and specific forward- and reverse primers that resembled the respective nucleotide sequence of the V- and J-regions ( Tiller et al., 2008 102. Tiller, T. ∙ Meffre, E. ∙ Yurasov, S. ... Efficient generation of monoclonal antibodies from single human B cells by single cell RT-PCR and expression vector cloning J. Immunol. Methods. 2008; 329 :112-124 Crossref Scopus (444) PubMed Google Scholar ) with expression vector overhangs for subsequent sequence and ligation independent cloning (SLIC). PCR was run at 98°C for 30 s; 35 cycles of 98°C for 10 s, 65°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 30 s; and 72°C for 2 min. 561_01_18_ΔINS was generated by cloning a synthesized (Eurofins Genomics) heavy-chain variable region DNA fragment of 1-18 lacking the CDRH1 insertion ( 28 PYTDDD 33 ). PCR products or synthesized DNA fragments were cloned into human antibody expression vectors (IgG1, kappa, or lambda chain) by SLIC assembly as previously described ( von Boehmer et al., 2016 105. von Boehmer, L. ∙ Liu, C. ∙ Ackerman, S. ... Sequencing and cloning of antigen-specific antibodies from mouse memory B cells Nat. Protoc. 2016; 11 :1908-1923 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ). Antibodies were produced in 293-6E cells (National Research Council Canada) by transfection using 25 kDa branched polyethylenimine (PEI) (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were maintained at 37°C and 6% CO2 in FreeStyle 293 Expression Medium (Thermo Fisher) and 0.2% penicillin/streptomycin (Thermo Fisher). 5-7 days after transfection, culture supernatants were harvested, filtered, and incubated with Protein G Sepharose (GE Life Sciences) overnight at 4°C. Antibodies were eluted from chromatography columns using 0.1 M glycine (pH = 3.0) and buffered in 1 M Tris (pH = 8.0). Subsequent buffer exchange to PBS and antibody concentration was performed using Amicon 30 kDa spin membranes (Millipore). Antibodies were filter-sterilized using Ultrafree-CL or Ultrafree-MC 0.22 μm membranes (Millipore) and stored at 4°C.
Pseudoviruses for the 12-strain global screening panel and f61 finger printing panel were produced in HEK293T cells by co-transfection with pSG3ΔEnv plasmid as described previously ( Doria-Rose et al., 2017; Hraber et al., 2017; Sarzotti-Kelsoe et al., 2014; Seaman et al., 2010 25.

Tiered categorization of a diverse panel of HIV-1 Env pseudoviruses for assessment of neutralizing antibodies J. Virol. 2010; 84 :1439-1452 Crossref Scopus (416) PubMed Google Scholar ). Single genome sequencing (SGS)-derived pseudoviruses were generated by co-transfection of SGS-derived CMV promoter-Env products and pSG3ΔEnv as previously described ( Kirchherr et al., 2007 52. Kirchherr, J.L. ∙ Lu, X. ∙ Kasongo, W. ... High throughput functional analysis of HIV-1 env genes without cloning J. Virol. Methods. 2007; 143 :104-111 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). For sequences obtained from mice, env/rev cassettes were amplified from the first-round SGS PCR product using primers env1Atopo 5′-CACCGGCTTAGGCATCTCCTATGGCAGGAAGAA and envB3in 5′-CACCTTAGGCATCTCCTATGGCAGGAAGAAG. Pseudoviruses were only produced from sequences containing no ambiguities. For patient-derived sequences, env/rev cassettes were amplified from the first-round SGS product using primers env1Atopo and Rev19 5′-ACTTTTTGACCACTTGCCACCCAT. CMV promoter and env/rev overlap PCR was performed using primers CMVenv 5′-AGTAATCAATTACGGGGTCATTAGTTCAT and Rev19. Mouse-derived sequences were amplified using the Platinum Taq High Fidelity Polymerase (Thermo Fisher), patient-derived sequences using the Phusion Hot Start Flex Polymerase (New England Biolabs).
Neutralization assays were performed as previously described ( Sarzotti-Kelsoe et al., 2014 84. Sarzotti-Kelsoe, M. ∙ Bailer, R.T. ∙ Turk, E. ... Optimization and validation of the TZM-bl assay for standardized assessments of neutralizing antibodies against HIV-1 J. Immunol. Methods. 2014; 409 :131-146 Crossref Scopus (162) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, pseudoviruses and dilution series of antibodies or purified IgG were mixed and co-incubated at 37°C for 1 h, followed by the addition of TZM-bl cells at a final concentration of 10 4 cells per well on a 96-well plate in 250 μl medium supplemented with DEAE-dextran at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml. Following a 2-day incubation at 37°C and 5% CO 2 , 150 μl of culture supernatant was removed and 100 μl luciferase assay reagent was added. After a 2 min incubation, 150 μl of lysate was transferred to a black microtiter assay plate and luminescence was determined using a luminometer. After subtracting background relative luminescence units (RLUs) of non-infected TZM-bl cells, 50% and 80% inhibitory concentrations (IC 50 s and IC 80 s) were determined as the antibody/IgG concentrations resulting in a 50%/80% RLU reduction compared to untreated virus control wells. Murine leukemia virus (MuLV)-pseudotyped virus was used to determine unspecific activity. Initial screening of isolated antibody clonal members was performed using a single dilution series per antibody. Antibodies or purified serum IgG in all further neutralization assays were tested in duplicates. For screening assays, assays against culture-derived viruses, assays of pseudovirus mutant variants, and assays of IDC561-derived pseudoviruses, bioluminescence was determined after adding a luciferin/lysis-buffer (10 mM MgCl2, 0.3 mM ATP, 0.5 mM Coenzyme A, 17 mM IGEPAL (all Sigma-Aldrich), and 1 mM D-Luciferin (GoldBio) in Tris-HCL). For assays against the 119-pseudovirus panel, the 100-pseudovirus clade C panel, and the f61 panel, bioluminescence was determined after adding Bright-Glo reagent (Promega).
Computational epitope prediction of serum IgG neutralizing activity was conducted as previously described ( Doria-Rose et al., 2017 25. Doria-Rose, N.A. ∙ Altae-Tran, H.R. ∙ Roark, R.S. ... Mapping Polyclonal HIV-1 Antibody Responses via Next-Generation Neutralization Fingerprinting PLoS Pathog. 2017; 13 :e1006148 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, neutralizing serum IgG activity was determined against the 20 pseudoviruses included in the f61 fingerprinting panel by a TZM-bl cell neutralization assay as described above. The determined IgG neutralization fingerprint is compared to the fingerprint of 10 bNAbs picked as reference for their specific epitope, and the prevalence of these reference antibody epitope specificities is computationally predicted and assigned a delineation score between 0 (low) and 1 (high).

Med. 2019; 216 :2253-2264 Crossref Scopus (1) PubMed Google Scholar ). For further analyses, a consensus sequence was generated and nucleotides with < 75% identity across reads were defined as ambiguities. Only full-length envelope sequences with high base call quality, less than 10 ambiguities, and no early stop-codons (unless due to ambiguities) were analyzed. Otherwise acceptable sequences showing ambiguities resulting in stop-codons or a frameshift were corrected manually.

B cells were isolated from PBMCs using CD19 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec) and stained with DAPI (Thermo Fisher), CD20-AF 700, IgG-APC, IgD-Pe-Cy7, IgM-FITC, and CD27-PE (all BD Biosciences) for 30 min on ice. 200,000 CD20 + IgG + IgM - IgD - CD27 - B cells were sorted into FBS (Sigma-Aldrich) using a BD FACSAria Fusion, and RNA of sorted B cells was isolated with the RNeasy Micro Kit (QIAGEN). cDNA was generated by template-switch reverse transcription according to the SMARTer RACE 5′/3′ manual using the SMARTScribe Reverse Transcriptase (Takara) with a template-switch oligo including an 18-nucleotide unique molecular identifier. Heavy-chain variable regions were amplified with an IgG-specific nested PCR and amplicons were used for library preparation and MiSeq 2x300 bp sequencing (Illumina). Raw NGS reads were pre-processed and assembled to final sequences as previously described ( Ehrhardt et al., 2019 28. Ehrhardt, S.A. ∙ Zehner, M. ∙ Krähling, V. ...

Mutational antigenic profiling has been previously described ( Dingens et al., 2017, 2019 21. Dingens, A.S. ∙ Haddox, H.K. ∙ Overbaugh, J. ... Comprehensive Mapping of HIV-1 Escape from a Broadly Neutralizing Antibody Cell Host Microbe. 2017; 21 :777-787.e4 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar 22.

An Antigenic Atlas of HIV-1 Escape from Broadly Neutralizing Antibodies Distinguishes Functional and Structural Epitopes Immunity. 2019; 50 :520-532.e3 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, 5x10 5 infectious units of two independently generated HIV-1 BG505 mutant virus libraries ( Haddox et al., 2018 42. Haddox, H.K. ∙ Dingens, A.S. ∙ Hilton, S.K. ... Mapping mutational effects along the evolutionary landscape of HIV envelope eLife. 2018; 7 :e34420 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) were neutralized with both 4 μg/ml or 8 μg/ml of 1-18 for one hour. Neutralized libraries were then used to infect 1x10 6 SupT1.CCR5 cells in R10 (RPMI (GE Life Sciences) supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 100 U/ml of penicillin and streptomycin) containing 100 μg/ml DEAE-dextran. Three hours post infection, the cells were resuspended in 1 mL R10. At twelve hours post infection, the non-integrated viral cDNA was isolated from cells via a miniprep. Each mutant virus library was also subjected to a mock selection, and four 10-fold serial dilutions of each mutant virus library were infected into 1x10 6 cells to serve as an infectivity standard curve from which the overall fraction of the library that survived antibody neutralization was quantified using qPCR ( Dingens et al., 2019 22. Dingens, A.S. ∙ Arenz, D. ∙ Weight, H. ... An Antigenic Atlas of HIV-1 Escape from Broadly Neutralizing Antibodies Distinguishes Functional and Structural Epitopes Immunity. 2019; 50 :520-532.e3 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ). Viral cDNA from antibody- and mock-selected samples was then sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq using the previously described barcoded subamplicon sequencing approach ( Haddox et al., 2016 41. Haddox, H.K. ∙ Dingens, A.S. ∙ Bloom, J.D. Experimental Estimation of the Effects of All Amino-Acid Mutations to HIV’s Envelope Protein on Viral Replication in Cell Culture PLoS Pathog. 2016; 12 :e1006114 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ). Details on the analysis of the resulting data are provided in the Quantification and Statistical Analysis and Data and Code Availability subsections below.
1-18 IgG was expressed by transient transfection in Expi293 cells (Thermo Fisher) and purified from transfected cell supernatants using a HiTrap MabSelect Protein A column (GE Life Sciences). Fab fragments were isolated as described ( Diskin et al., 2011 23. Diskin, R. ∙ Scheid, J.F. ∙ Marcovecchio, P.M. ... Increasing the potency and breadth of an HIV antibody by using structure-based rational design Science. 2011; 334 :1289-1293 Crossref Scopus (271) PubMed Google Scholar ) after papain cleavage of 1-18 IgG, removal of Fc by protein A chromatography, and then purification by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) on a Superdex-200 Increase 10/300 column (GE Life Sciences) equilibrated with TBS (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl). 1-55 Fab was expressed as a light-chain C-terminal His 6 -tagged Fab by transient transfection in 293-6E cells (National Research Council of Canada) and purified from supernatants using Ni 2+ -NTA affinity chromatography (GE Life Sciences) followed by SEC purification with a Superdex-200 Increase 10/300 column equilibrated with TBS. All Fabs were stored at 4°C.
BG505 SOSIP.664 trimer was stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells (kind gift of J.P. Moore and A. Cupo) as described ( Chung et al., 2014 14. Chung, N.P. ∙ Matthews, K. ∙ Kim, H.J. ... Stable 293 T and CHO cell lines expressing cleaved, stable HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein trimers for structural and vaccine studies Retrovirology. 2014; 11 :33 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ) and purified from cell culture supernatant over a 2G12 immunoaffinity column followed by SEC purification on a Superdex-200 16/60 column (GE Life Sciences) equilibrated with TBS. RC1 SOSIP.664 was expressed by transient transfection in 293-6E cells and purified as described ( Escolano et al., 2019 30. Escolano, A. ∙ Gristick, H.B. ∙ Abernathy, M.E. ... Immunization expands B cells specific to HIV-1 V3 glycan in mice and macaques Nature. 2019; 570 :468-473 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ). Individual SEC fractions of each SOSIP trimer were stored at 4°C.
1-18 or 1-55 Fab and 10-1074 Fab were incubated with BG505 SOSIP.664 or RC1 in a 3:3:1 molar ratio per protomer overnight at room temperature and then purified by SEC on a Superdex-200 Increase 10/300 column. Fab–Env complexes were concentrated to 2.2 mg/ml (1-18 complex) or 0.75 mg/mL (1-55 complex) in TBS, and 3 μL was added to a Quantifoil grid (R2/2 Cu 400 mesh for the 1-18 complex and R1.2/1.3 Cu 300 mesh for 1-55 complex; Electron Microscopy Services) that had been freshly glow-discharged using a PELCO easiGLOW (Ted Pella). Samples were vitrified in 100% liquid ethane using a Mark IV Vitrobot (Thermo Fisher) after blotting for 3-3.5 s with Whatman No. 1 filter paper at 22°C and 100% humidity.
For the 1-18–BG505–10-1074 complex, micrographs were collected on a Titan Krios transmission electron microscope (Thermo Fisher) operating at 300 kV using EPU automated software (Thermo Fisher). Movies were obtained on a Gatan K2 Summit direct electron detector operating in counting mode at a nominal magnification of 130,000x (1.057 Å/pixel calibrated) using a defocus range of −1 to −2.6 μm. Movies were collected with an 8 s exposure time with a rate of 8 e - /pix/s, which resulted in a total dose of ~60 e - /Å 2 over 40 fractions. Movies were motion corrected including dose-weighting using Motioncor2 ( Zheng et al., 2017 121. Zheng, S.Q. ∙ Palovcak, E. ∙ Armache, J.P. ... MotionCor2: anisotropic correction of beam-induced motion for improved cryo-electron microscopy Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :331-332 Crossref Scopus (955) PubMed Google Scholar ) within Relion-3 ( Zivanov et al., 2018 126. Zivanov, J. ∙ Nakane, T. ∙ Forsberg, B.O. ... New tools for automated high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination in RELION-3 eLife. 2018; 7 :e42166 Crossref Scopus (297) PubMed Google Scholar ). The non-dose-weighted images were used for CTF estimation using Gctf ( Zhang, 2016 119. Zhang, K. Gctf: Real-time CTF determination and correction J. Struct. Biol. 2016; 193 :1-12 Crossref Scopus (701) PubMed Google Scholar ), and micrographs with power spectra that showed poor CTF fits or signs of crystalline ice were discarded. Particles were then picked in a reference-free manner using the Laplacian-of-Gaussian auto-picking function in Relion-3. A total of 352,598 particles were extracted, binned 4x4 (4.23 Å/pixel), and subjected to reference-free 2D classification in Relion-3. Particles corresponding to good classes were re-extracted and un-binned (1.057 Å/pixel). An ab initio volume was generated in cryoSPARC ( Punjani et al., 2017 77. Punjani, A. ∙ Rubinstein, J.L. ∙ Fleet, D.J. ... cryoSPARC: algorithms for rapid unsupervised cryo-EM structure determination Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :290-296 Crossref Scopus (403) PubMed Google Scholar ) from micrographs that were collected from the same grid in a Talos Arctica that was used as an initial model for homogeneous 3D-refinement in Relion 3 (assuming C1 symmetry). Particles were then subjected to 3D classification (C1 symmetry), and classes with low-resolution features were removed. Selected classes that appeared 3-fold symmetric were thus subjected to homogeneous 3D refinement assuming C3 symmetry with a soft mask applied that did not include the Fab C H C L domains. Per-particle motion correction and CTF refinement were performed in Relion-3, followed by a final homogeneous 3D refinement. A masked post-processed volume of 230,924 particles resulted in a gold-standard FSC (GSFSC) calculation of 2.5 Å ( Scheres and Chen, 2012 90. Scheres, S.H. ∙ Chen, S. Prevention of overfitting in cryo-EM structure determination Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :853-854 Crossref Scopus (510) PubMed Google Scholar ).
For the 1-55–RC1–10-1074 complex, data collection on a Thermo Fisher 200 kV Talos Arctica cryo-electron microscope equipped with a Falcon 3EC camera, and 10-1074 interactions with RC1 were previously described ( Escolano et al., 2019 30. Escolano, A. ∙ Gristick, H.B. ∙ Abernathy, M.E. ... Immunization expands B cells specific to HIV-1 V3 glycan in mice and macaques Nature. 2019; 570 :468-473 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ). For analysis of the 1-55–RC1 interaction, we reprocessed the data using Relion-3, following a similar procedure as described above for the 1-18–BG505–10-1074 complex. Compared to the original reconstruction, per-particle motion correction and CTF refinement were done in Relion-3, followed by a final homogeneous 3D refinement. A masked post-processed volume of 110,126 particles resulted in a GSFSC calculation of 3.9 Å.
Initial coordinates were generated by docking individual chains from reference structures into cryo-EM density using UCSF Chimera ( Goddard et al., 2007 37. Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ∙ Ferrin, T.E. Visualizing density maps with UCSF Chimera J. Struct. Biol. 2007; 157 :281-287 Crossref Scopus (449) PubMed Google Scholar ). The following PDB coordinates were used: gp120: 5T3Z; gp41: 6MTJ; 10-1074: 5T3Z; 1-18 and 1-55: 4RWY. These initial models were then refined into cryo-EM maps using one round of rigid body refinement followed by real space refinement. Sequence-updated models were built manually in Coot ( Emsley et al., 2010 29. Emsley, P. ∙ Lohkamp, B. ∙ Scott, W.G. ... Features and development of Coot Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :486-501 Crossref Scopus (11218) PubMed Google Scholar ) and then refined using iterative rounds of refinement in Coot and Phenix ( Adams et al., 2010 1. Adams, P.D. ∙ Afonine, P.V. ∙ Bunkóczi, G. ... PHENIX: a comprehensive Python-based system for macromolecular structure solution Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :213-221 Crossref Scopus (12062) PubMed Google Scholar ). Glycans were modeled at PNGSs in Coot using ‘blurred’ maps processed with a variety of B-factors ( Terwilliger et al., 2018 101. Terwilliger, T.C. ∙ Sobolev, O.V. ∙ Afonine, P.V. ... Automated map sharpening by maximization of detail and connectivity Acta Crystallogr. D Struct. Biol. 2018; 74 :545-559 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ). Water molecules were added to the 1-18–BG505–10-1074 model based on local density and distance to hydrogen bonding partners. Validation of model coordinates was performed using MolProbity ( Chen et al., 2010 12. Chen, V.B. ∙ Arendall, 3rd, W.B. ∙ Headd, J.J. ... MolProbity: all-atom structure validation for macromolecular crystallography Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :12-21 Crossref Scopus (7139) PubMed Google Scholar ) and is reported in Table S6 .
Structural figures were made using PyMOL (Version 1.8.2.1 Schrodinger, LLC) or UCSF Chimera ( Goddard et al., 2007 37. Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ∙ Ferrin, T.E. Visualizing density maps with UCSF Chimera J. Struct. Biol. 2007; 157 :281-287 Crossref Scopus (449) PubMed Google Scholar ). Electrostatic calculations were done using the APBS and PDB2PQR servers ( Unni et al., 2011 103. Unni, S. ∙ Huang, Y. ∙ Hanson, R.M. ... Web servers and services for electrostatics calculations with APBS and PDB2PQR J. Comput. Chem. 2011; 32 :1488-1491 Crossref Scopus (128) PubMed Google Scholar ). Buried surface areas (BSAs) were calculated using the PDBePISA server ( Krissinel and Henrick, 2007 55. Krissinel, E. ∙ Henrick, K. Inference of macromolecular assemblies from crystalline state J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372 :774-797 Crossref Scopus (5056) PubMed Google Scholar ). Local resolution maps were calculated using the Local Res program embedded in Relion-3 ( Kucukelbir et al., 2014 57. Kucukelbir, A. ∙ Sigworth, F.J. ∙ Tagare, H.D. Quantifying the local resolution of cryo-EM density maps Nat. Methods. 2014; 11 :63-65 Crossref Scopus (678) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The mutational antigenic profiling data were analyzed with dms_tools2 version 2.5.1 ( https://jbloomlab.github.io/dms_tools2/ ; Bloom, 2015 7. Bloom, J.D. Software for the analysis and visualization of deep mutational scanning data BMC Bioinformatics. 2015; 16 :168 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ). The fraction surviving and excess fraction surviving statistics have been previously described ( Dingens et al., 2019; Doud et al., 2018 22. Dingens, A.S. ∙ Arenz, D. ∙ Weight, H. ... An Antigenic Atlas of HIV-1 Escape from Broadly Neutralizing Antibodies Distinguishes Functional and Structural Epitopes Immunity. 2019; 50 :520-532.e3 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar 27. Doud, M.B. ∙ Lee, J.M. ∙ Bloom, J.D. How single mutations affect viral escape from broad and narrow antibodies to H1 influenza hemagglutinin Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :1386 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ) and are documented at https://jbloomlab.github.io/dms_tools2/fracsurvive.html . Sequencing wild-type DNA plasmid served as the error control during the calculation of the fraction surviving. The HIV Antibody Database ( West et al., 2013 111. West, Jr., A.P. ∙ Scharf, L. ∙ Horwitz, J. ... Computational analysis of anti-HIV-1 antibody neutralization panel data to identify potential functional epitope residues Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110 :10598-10603 Crossref Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used for the calculation of Env conservation in 1-18 contact residues and for the analysis of neutralization panel data. Clade B reference sequences were obtained through the Los Alamos National Laboratory HIV Database (Filtered Web Alignment, https://www.hiv.lanl.gov/ ). Median germline nucleotide identity and CDRH3 lengths of HIV-1 Env-reactive and total IgG + B cells of IDC561 were compared using the Mann-Whitney U-test in Python 3 using the “stats” module in the “scipy” package. For the correlation of the neutralizing activity of 1-18 and serum IgG of IDC561, spearman’s rank correlation coefficient was calculated in Prism (GraphPad). The neutralizing activity of 1-18 and 1-18Δins was compared using the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test in Prism (GraphPad).
Heavy and light chain sequences of tested monoclonal antibodies have been deposited at GenBank (accession numbers MN867951 - MN868062). SGS-derived HIV-1 env obtained from HIV-1 YU2 -infected humanized mice and from individual IDC561 have been deposited at GenBank (accession numbers MN870987 - MN871327 and MN871328 - MN871333, respectively). Density maps and atomic coordinates for the 1-18–BG505–10-1074 and 1-55–RC1–10-1074 complexes were deposited in the Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB) and Protein Data Bank (PDB) with accession numbers EMD-20739 and PDB 6UDJ (1-18 complex) and EMD-20740 and PDB 6UDK (1-55 complex). The entire mutational antigenic profiling analysis is available at https://github.com/jbloomlab/MAP_118 , and the accompanying Illumina sequencing data is on the NCBI SRA with accession numbers SRX6752366 - SRX6752371.
