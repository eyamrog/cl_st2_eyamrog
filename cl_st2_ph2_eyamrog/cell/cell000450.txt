Title: The role of the Cer1 transposon in horizontal transfer of transgenerational memory


Abstract: Summary

Animals face both external and internal dangers: pathogens threaten from the environment, and unstable genomic elements threaten from within. C. elegans protects itself from pathogens by “reading” bacterial small RNAs, using this information to both induce avoidance and transmit memories for four generations. Here, we found that memories can be transferred from either lysed animals or from conditioned media to naive animals via Cer1 retrotransposon-encoded virus-like particles. Moreover, Cer1 functions internally at the step of transmission of information from the germline to neurons and is required for learned avoidance. The presence of the Cer1 retrotransposon in wild C. elegans strains correlates with the ability to learn and inherit small-RNA-induced pathogen avoidance. Together, these results suggest that C. elegans has co-opted a potentially dangerous retrotransposon to instead protect itself and its progeny from a common pathogen through its inter-tissue signaling ability, hijacking this genomic element for its own adaptive immunity benefit.

Section: Introduction

The transmission of information across generations through non-genetic means, or transgenerational epigenetic inheritance (TEI), was long thought to be impossible due to the Weismann barrier between the germline and somatic cells, which preserves immortal germ cells in their pristine state.

Neurosci. 2014; 17 :89-96 Crossref Scopus (886) PubMed Google Scholar ) suggest that inheritance of stress responses may help animals survive in harsh environments. We recently discovered that C. elegans passes small RNA-mediated learned Pseudomonas aeruginosa avoidance behavior on to several generations of progeny through a molecular mechanism that requires an intact germline and neuronal signaling ( Kaletsky et al., 2020a 23. Kaletsky, R. ∙ Moore, R.S. ∙ Vrla, G.D. ... C. elegans interprets bacterial non-coding RNAs to learn pathogenic avoidance Nature. 2020; 586 :445-451 Crossref Scopus (95) PubMed Google Scholar ). This process requires uptake of a P. aeruginosa small RNA called P11, processing through the RNA interference pathway, piRNA regulation and P granule function in the germline, downregulation of a neuronal gene with homology to a specific bacterial small RNA, and gene expression changes in the ASI sensory neuron ( Kaletsky et al., 2020a 23. Kaletsky, R. ∙ Moore, R.S. ∙ Vrla, G.D. ... C. elegans interprets bacterial non-coding RNAs to learn pathogenic avoidance Nature. 2020; 586 :445-451 Crossref Scopus (95) PubMed Google Scholar ). This small RNA-mediated process enables mothers and four generations of her progeny to avoid pathogenic P. aeruginosa .
The question of whether animals can transmit memories to one another has a storied and controversial history ( McConnell et al., 1959 30. McConnell, J.V. ∙ Jacobson, A.L. ∙ Kimble, D.P. The effects of regeneration upon retention of a conditioned response in the planarian J. Comp. Physiol. Psychol. 1959; 52 :1-5 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ; Shomrat and Levin, 2013 45. Shomrat, T. ∙ Levin, M. An automated training paradigm reveals long-term memory in planarians and its persistence through head regeneration J. Exp. Biol. 2013; 216 :3799-3810 Crossref Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ), but recent work in Aplysia suggests that RNA from the CNS of trained animals can induce a form of non-associative long-term memory when injected into naive animals ( Bédécarrats et al., 2018 7. Bédécarrats, A. ∙ Chen, S. ∙ Pearce, K. ... RNA from Trained Aplysia Can Induce an Epigenetic Engram for Long-Term Sensitization in Untrained Aplysia eNeuro. 2018; 5 ENEURO.0038-18.2018 Crossref Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar ). Whether these horizontally transferred memories could be transmitted transgenerationally, thereby breaking the Weismann barrier, or in a natural context has not yet been addressed.
Here, we find that whole-worm lysates and conditioned media (CM) from the grandprogeny of trained C. elegans can transmit memory of learned avoidance and transgenerational inheritance of that avoidance behavior to naive animals and their four generations of progeny through virus-like particles (VLPs) encoded by the Cer1 retrotransposon. In addition to its role in horizontal memory transfer, Cer1 is required within individuals for small-RNA-mediated learned pathogen avoidance and transgenerational epigenetic inheritance through its ability to convey information from the germline to neurons. Cer1 ’s expression in wild strains correlates with their ability to carry out these behaviors, a beneficial role for Cer1 that contrasts with its previously reported deleterious effects ( Dennis et al., 2012 14. Dennis, S. ∙ Sheth, U. ∙ Feldman, J.L. ... C. elegans germ cells show temperature and age-dependent expression of Cer1, a Gypsy/Ty3-related retrotransposon PLoS Pathog. 2012; 8 :e1002591 Crossref Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, Cer1 function may provide C. elegans long-lasting protection from pathogens in their natural environments.

Section: Results

C. elegans is initially attracted to P. aeruginosa ( Shtonda and Avery, 2006 46. Shtonda, B.B. ∙ Avery, L. Dietary choice behavior in Caenorhabditis elegans J. Exp. Biol. 2006; 209 :89-102 Crossref Scopus (289) PubMed Google Scholar ) but learns to avoid this pathogen after exposure ( Zhang et al., 2005 55. Zhang, Y. ∙ Lu, H. ∙ Bargmann, C.I. Pathogenic bacteria induce aversive olfactory learning in Caenorhabditis elegans Nature. 2005; 438 :179-184 Crossref Scopus (583) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 1 A). Worms learn to avoid P. aeruginosa (PA14) through several independent mechanisms involving bacterial small RNAs, metabolites, and additional pathogenesis factors ( Kaletsky et al., 2020a 23. Kaletsky, R. ∙ Moore, R.S. ∙ Vrla, G.D. ...

However, small RNA-mediated learned avoidance is the only pathway that leads to transgenerational memory inheritance, a process in which the worms “read” PA14’s P11 small RNA and use it to alter neuronal function, resulting in learned avoidance ( Kaletsky et al., 2020a 23. Kaletsky, R. ∙ Moore, R.S. ∙ Vrla, G.D. ... C. elegans interprets bacterial non-coding RNAs to learn pathogenic avoidance Nature. 2020; 586 :445-451 Crossref Scopus (95) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S1 A).
To test whether transgenerational learned avoidance can be horizontally transferred to naive worms, we used mechanical homogenization to prepare crude lysates from wild-type grand-progeny (F2) of P11- or control-trained grandmothers ( Figures 1 B and 1C). Naive animals were exposed to the lysate on E. coli plates for 24 h, then tested for P. aeruginosa avoidance learning. We found that lysate from F2s of P11-trained, but not control-trained, grandmothers was sufficient to induce naive worms to avoid P. aeruginosa ( Figures 1 C and 1D), indicating horizontal transmission of memory.
We previously observed that training of mothers with either P. aeruginosa or P11 small RNA induces a memory of learned avoidance that lasts through the F4 generation ( Kaletsky et al., 2020a 23. Kaletsky, R. ∙ Moore, R.S. ∙ Vrla, G.D. ... C. elegans interprets bacterial non-coding RNAs to learn pathogenic avoidance Nature. 2020; 586 :445-451 Crossref Scopus (95) PubMed Google Scholar ; Moore et al., 2019 33. Moore, R.S. ∙ Kaletsky, R. ∙ Murphy, C.T. Piwi/PRG-1 Argonaute and TGF-β Mediate Transgenerational Learned Pathogenic Avoidance Cell. 2019; 177 :1827-1841 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (152) PubMed Google Scholar ). While the lysates from F2, F3, and F4 progeny can induce learning in naive animals ( Figures 1 D–1F), lysate from the F5 generation—which does not show inheritance of learned behavior from either P. aeruginosa or P11 training—is not able to transfer learned avoidance ( Figure 1 G; Figures S1 B–S1G). Furthermore, progeny of F2 lysate-trained P0 animals inherited this learned avoidance behavior, lasting through the F4 generation after training ( Figures 1 H and 1I), indicating that transgenerational inheritance can occur after horizontal transfer of memory.
We also previously established that training animals on P. aeruginosa or P11 small RNA induces avoidance specifically against P. aeruginosa , rather than to other bacteria ( Kaletsky et al., 2020b 24. Kaletsky, R. ∙ Moore, R.S. ∙ Vrla, G.D. ... C. elegans “reads” bacterial non-coding RNAs to learn pathogenic avoidance BioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ; Moore et al., 2019 33. Moore, R.S. ∙ Kaletsky, R. ∙ Murphy, C.T. Piwi/PRG-1 Argonaute and TGF-β Mediate Transgenerational Learned Pathogenic Avoidance Cell. 2019; 177 :1827-1841 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (152) PubMed Google Scholar ). To test whether the horizontally acquired memory is specific to P. aeruginosa , lysate-trained animals were tested for changes in preference to Pseudomonas fluorescens (Pf15) or Serratia marcescens . While worms exposed to lysate from grandprogeny of P11 small RNA-trained grandmothers learned to avoid P. aeruginosa compared to controls, lysate training did not alter the worms’ attraction to either P. fluorescens (Pf15) or S. marcescens ( Figure 1 J). These results indicate that the horizontally transferred memories are specifically encoded for P. aeruginosa avoidance and are likely not caused by a non-specific response that induces broad neuronal changes in preference.
RNA has been implicated in the transfer of memory from the CNS of trained Aplysia to naive animals ( Bédécarrats et al., 2018 7. Bédécarrats, A. ∙ Chen, S. ∙ Pearce, K. ... RNA from Trained Aplysia Can Induce an Epigenetic Engram for Long-Term Sensitization in Untrained Aplysia eNeuro. 2018; 5 ENEURO.0038-18.2018 Crossref Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar ), and we previously showed that the mechanism by which C. elegans learns the identity of pathogenic Pseudomonas requires bacterial small RNAs ( Kaletsky et al., 2020a 23. Kaletsky, R. ∙ Moore, R.S. ∙ Vrla, G.D. ... C. elegans interprets bacterial non-coding RNAs to learn pathogenic avoidance Nature. 2020; 586 :445-451 Crossref Scopus (95) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, we tested whether there is transfer of memory from (1) free, total RNA isolated from F2s of trained animals or (2) RNase-treated lysate. We found that Trizol-isolated, free, total RNA from trained F2s ( Figure 2 A) prevented avoidance learning from lysate, while RNase treatment of the trained F2 lysate did not prevent memory transfer from F2 lysate ( Figure 2 B).
While on its face these results might suggest RNA is not involved, another possibility is that the RNA information could be protected; for example, a similar RNase treatment of Arc VLPs still allows transfer of Arc mRNA between neurons ( Pastuzyn et al., 2018 37. Pastuzyn, E.D. ∙ Day, C.E. ∙ Kearns, R.B. ... The Neuronal Gene Arc Encodes a Repurposed Retrotransposon Gag Protein that Mediates Intercellular RNA Transfer Cell. 2018; 172 :275-288 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (330) PubMed Google Scholar ). To determine if purified VLPs might carry the memory of P11 training, we tested density-fractionated lysates from F2s of P11-trained grandmothers for their ability to induce avoidance. Only the densest fraction (#6), which should contain heavier particles including VLPs, induced P. aeruginosa avoidance behavior in naive animals ( Figure 2 C).
To determine whether VLPs were present in the fraction that induced learning behavior, we performed electron microscopy on the densest fraction ( Figure 2 D) and identified ∼90 nm VLPs. Not only was this fraction able to induce behavior in the trained generation, but the memory was also retained in progeny through the F4 generation ( Figure 2 E; Figure S2 A). RNase treatment of the VLP fraction did not prevent the induction of avoidance learning ( Figure 2 F), supporting the model that VLPs protect cargo RNA. We isolated RNA from the VLP fraction and found that this protected RNA from the RNase-treated and purified lysate was mostly <200 nt, with limited larger size species present, suggesting that a small or fragmented RNA could carry the memory signal ( Figure S2 B).
The VLPs we observed by electron microscopy (EM) were similar in size to VLPs made by the Cer1 retrotransposon ( Dennis et al., 2012 14. Dennis, S. ∙ Sheth, U. ∙ Feldman, J.L. ... C. elegans germ cells show temperature and age-dependent expression of Cer1, a Gypsy/Ty3-related retrotransposon PLoS Pathog. 2012; 8 :e1002591 Crossref Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cer1 has homology to the Ty3/Gypsy family of retrotransposons ( Figure 3 A) and forms VLPs that are detectable by EM and present in the germline of N2 animals at 20°C ( Figure 3 B). Therefore, we investigated whether Cer1 might be involved in learned pathogen avoidance and its inheritance. The Cer1 GAG protein was detected in the densest, VLP-containing fraction (fraction #6), which induced learned avoidance ( Figure 2 C) in wild-type worms ( Figures 3 C and 3D). A point mutation (G6369A) in Cer1 abolishes its detection by immunofluorescence ( Figure 3 B) or by western blot ( Figure 3 D), suggesting that this mutation prevents expression of Cer1 gene products. Cer1 mutant mothers were still able to learn on a P. aeruginosa lawn ( Figure S3 A), consistent with intact routes of lawn learning, such as innate immunity and metabolites; however, loss of Cer1 abolishes the F1 inheritance of P. aeruginosa avoidance behavior ( Figure 3 E), which functions through the separate small RNA-mediated pathway ( Kaletsky et al., 2020a 23. Kaletsky, R. ∙ Moore, R.S. ∙ Vrla, G.D. ... C. elegans interprets bacterial non-coding RNAs to learn pathogenic avoidance Nature. 2020; 586 :445-451 Crossref Scopus (95) PubMed Google Scholar ). Reduction of Cer1 via RNAi also abrogated P. aeruginosa -mediated pathogen avoidance inheritance ( Figure 3 F; Figure S3 B). Loss of Cer1 by mutation or RNAi also completely abrogated the ability of mothers trained on E. coli +P11 to learn P. aeruginosa avoidance ( Figures 3 G and 3H). Unlike Cer1 , loss of a different Ty3/Gypsy retrotransposon, Cer4 , had no effect on learning or transgenerational memory induced by PA14 lawn or E. coli+ P11 training of N2 mothers ( Figures S3 C–S3F).
Since Cer1 is required for small RNA-mediated learned avoidance behavior, we next asked whether Cer1 acts directly in neurons. We examined Cer1 expression in neurons using immunofluorescence staining of worms following control or P11 exposure, and while Cer1 was detected in the germline, it was not detected in neurons ( Figure 3 I). Furthermore, neuronal expression of Cer1 in the Cer1 mutant background did not rescue PA14 learned avoidance ( Figures S3 G and S3H). These results show that Cer1 expression in neurons is not likely to regulate avoidance learning. Moreover, P11 exposure does not increase the level of Cer1 expressed in the worm ( Figure S3 I).
Upon training with P. aeruginosa or P11 small RNA, daf-7p::gfp expression increases in the ASI sensory neuron ( Kaletsky et al., 2020a 23. Kaletsky, R. ∙ Moore, R.S. ∙ Vrla, G.D. ... C. elegans interprets bacterial non-coding RNAs to learn pathogenic avoidance Nature. 2020; 586 :445-451 Crossref Scopus (95) PubMed Google Scholar ; Meisel et al., 2014 32. Meisel, J.D. ∙ Panda, O. ∙ Mahanti, P. ... Chemosensation of bacterial secondary metabolites modulates neuroendocrine signaling and behavior of C. elegans Cell. 2014; 159 :267-280 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (174) PubMed Google Scholar ; Moore et al., 2019 33. Moore, R.S. ∙ Kaletsky, R. ∙ Murphy, C.T. Piwi/PRG-1 Argonaute and TGF-β Mediate Transgenerational Learned Pathogenic Avoidance Cell. 2019; 177 :1827-1841 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (152) PubMed Google Scholar ). Loss of Cer1 prevents this increase in expression, indicating that Cer1 acts upstream of the regulation of daf-7 expression in the ASI neuron ( Figure 3 J). Together, these results suggest that Cer1 is required for small RNA-mediated pathogen avoidance in mothers and their progeny, Cer1 acts upstream of neurons in the small RNA-mediated learning pathway, and Cer1 protein is present in the VLP fraction from worm lysates that induces horizontal transfer of learned memories.
To determine whether Cer1 is required for not only vertical memory transmission to progeny but also for horizonal memory transfer, we prepared worm lysates and VLP-containing fractions from wild-type and Cer1 mutant F2s from control or P11-trained grandmothers ( Figure 4 A). Consistent with the requirement for Cer1 in horizontal memory acquisition, neither the lysate nor the analogous density-purified fraction (fraction #6) isolated from Cer1 mutants derived from P11-trained grandmothers were able to induce avoidance of P. aeruginosa ( Figures 4 B and 4C). Immunogold staining for Cer1 GAG protein also demonstrated the presence of Cer1 in the VLP fraction from wild-type worms ( Figures 4 D–4F). Cer1-positive VLPs were not detected in fraction #6 from a C. elegans wild isolate (CB4856) that lacks full-length Cer1 in its genome ( Figures 4 D–4F). These results suggest that Cer1 VLPs are required for the horizontal transfer of transgenerational epigenetic memories to naive worms.
We previously showed that the intestine-expressed double-stranded RNA transporter SID-2 ( McEwan et al., 2012 31. McEwan, D.L. ∙ Weisman, A.S. ∙ Hunter, C.P. Uptake of extracellular double-stranded RNA by SID-2 Mol. Cell. 2012; 47 :746-754 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (138) PubMed Google Scholar ) is required for P11-mediated small RNA learning ( Kaletsky et al., 2020a 23. Kaletsky, R. ∙ Moore, R.S. ∙ Vrla, G.D. ... C. elegans interprets bacterial non-coding RNAs to learn pathogenic avoidance Nature. 2020; 586 :445-451 Crossref Scopus (95) PubMed Google Scholar ). Since Cer1 is required for both vertical and horizontal transfer of pathogen avoidance learning, we next asked whether SID-2 is required in recipient worms or whether Cer1 -mediated horizontal memory transfer bypasses this requirement. We exposed sid-2 mutants to the lysate from wild-type donors ( Figures 4 G and 4H); both wild-type and sid-2 mutant worms acquired PA14 avoidance memory, which was inherited through the F4 generation of progeny ( Figure S4 ). These results demonstrate that SID-2 is not required for uptake of the memory signal from donor worms.
We next asked whether a germline is required in recipient worms or if treating with Cer1 -containing lysate bypasses this requirement in recipient animals (for example, by direct uptake by neurons). However, germline-less glp-1(e2141) mutants failed to learn P. aeruginosa avoidance upon F2 lysate training ( Figure 4 I). Similarly, Cer1 mutants trained with wild-type F2 lysates were unable to learn P. aeruginosa avoidance ( Figure 4 J); this was also true of a wild isolate that lacks a copy of Cer1 in its genome ( Figure S4 B). These results show that both Cer1 and a functional germline are required in recipient animals for horizontal memory transfer through Cer1 VLPs.
Our results show that Cer1 is required in mothers for small RNA-mediated learned avoidance and in their progeny for the inheritance of this behavior. Previously, we found that the process of inducing transgenerational inheritance of pathogen avoidance requires uptake of small, non-coding RNAs from Pseudomonas , processing of this small RNA in the intestine and germline, and transmission of an unknown signal that is conveyed to the ASI neurons to influence avoidance behavior ( Kaletsky et al., 2020a 23. Kaletsky, R. ∙ Moore, R.S. ∙ Vrla, G.D. ... C. elegans interprets bacterial non-coding RNAs to learn pathogenic avoidance Nature. 2020; 586 :445-451 Crossref Scopus (95) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To identify the mechanism of Cer1 ’s function in learned pathogen avoidance and its inheritance, we wanted to determine the step at which it is required:the initiation of the transgenerational signal, maintenance of this signal in the germline from generation to generation, or a subsequent, post-germline step that results in execution of avoidance behavior (transmission of the signal from germline to neurons or neuronal function) ( Figure 5 A). The step at which Cer1 acts in the pathway was not clear from our experiments because a mutant or Cer1 RNAi for several generations would not distinguish a lasting and permanent effect of Cer1 activation from a transient effect that only affects one step of the transgenerational learned pathogen avoidance process. However, these steps can be distinguished through a simple experiment: knockdown of the gene of interest in the F1 generation after P0 training, followed by control RNAi in generations F2-F5. Knockdown of a gene involved in initiation (P0) would have no effect if reduced only in the F1 generation ( Figure 5 A, blue line, “initiation”), F1 knockdown of a gene involved in germline maintenance or propagation would permanently eliminate learned behavior (orange line, “maintenance/ propagation”), and F1 knockdown of a gene that only functions in transmission of the signal or functions in neurons would eliminate the behavior for a generation or two but should return once the RNAi knockdown is ended (green line, “behavior”).
Knockdown of sid-2 , the RNA transporter that is expressed in the intestine ( McEwan et al., 2012 31. McEwan, D.L. ∙ Weisman, A.S. ∙ Hunter, C.P. Uptake of extracellular double-stranded RNA by SID-2 Mol. Cell. 2012; 47 :746-754 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (138) PubMed Google Scholar ), only in F1 does not affect behavior in any generation, likely because its role is to facilitate uptake of bacterial small RNAs from the gut, which is critical in initiation (P0) but is not needed in later generations ( Figure 5 B; Figure S5 A). By contrast, knockdown of the piRNA Piwi/Argonaute PRG-1 in the F1 generation not only eliminates behavior in F1, but also causes a permanent loss of avoidance behavior ( Figure 5 C; Figure S5 B). These results are consistent with previous data suggesting that prg-1 is required for maintenance or propagation of avoidance behavior and that loss of prg-1 erases transgenerational memory ( Ashe et al., 2012 3. Ashe, A. ∙ Sapetschnig, A. ∙ Weick, E.-M. ... piRNAs can trigger a multigenerational epigenetic memory in the germline of C. elegans Cell. 2012; 150 :88-99 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (534) PubMed Google Scholar ). The TGF-beta ligand DAF-7 is expressed in the ASI neuron and is required to execute the avoidance behavior ( Kaletsky et al., 2020a 23. Kaletsky, R. ∙ Moore, R.S. ∙ Vrla, G.D. ... C. elegans interprets bacterial non-coding RNAs to learn pathogenic avoidance Nature. 2020; 586 :445-451 Crossref Scopus (95) PubMed Google Scholar ; Moore et al., 2019 33. Moore, R.S. ∙ Kaletsky, R. ∙ Murphy, C.T. Piwi/PRG-1 Argonaute and TGF-β Mediate Transgenerational Learned Pathogenic Avoidance Cell. 2019; 177 :1827-1841 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (152) PubMed Google Scholar ). Reduction of daf-7 by RNAi in the F1 generation following maternal P. aeruginosa ( Figure S5 C) or E. coli +P11 ( Figure 5 D) training abrogated avoidance behavior in the same generation (F1). However, progeny raised on control RNAi recovered their avoidance behavior in the F2–F4 generations ( Figure 5 D; Figure S5 C), demonstrating that the encoded memory was retained even when daf-7 expression was reduced, and that avoidance behavior could return. This shows that daf-7 is not required for germline maintenance of transgenerational memory but is instead involved in the execution of avoidance behavior in each generation. These sid-2 , prg-1 , and daf-7 RNAi initiation versus maintenance versus execution behavior results, respectively, agree with their previously determined roles in intestine ( McEwan et al., 2012 31.

Cer1 capsids are present in the germline, and their presence depends on prg-1 and P granules in worms ( Dennis et al., 2012 14. Dennis, S. ∙ Sheth, U. ∙ Feldman, J.L. ...

Therefore, we first hypothesized that Cer1 might function at the step of maintaining the transgenerational signal in the germline, similar to prg-1 ( Figure 5 C). However, while Cer1(RNAi) treatment in the F1 progeny of wild-type mothers trained with E. coli expressing P11 ( Figure 5 E; Figure S4 D, right) or with P. aeruginosa ( Figure S5 D, left) caused loss of avoidance behavior, the avoidance memory recovered in subsequent generations maintained on control RNAi allowing Cer1 re-expression (F2–F4; Figure 5 E). These results resembled daf-7 knockdown and recovery rather than the permanent loss of learned avoidance that prg-1 knockdown causes, suggesting that Cer1 acts in the execution of avoidance behavior rather than at the step of maintenance of the transgenerational signal. This further suggested that Cer1 ’s role in learned pathogen avoidance might not be restricted to germline function, despite the fact that it is primarily expressed in the germline ( Dennis et al., 2012 14. Dennis, S. ∙ Sheth, U. ∙ Feldman, J.L. ... C. elegans germ cells show temperature and age-dependent expression of Cer1, a Gypsy/Ty3-related retrotransposon PLoS Pathog. 2012; 8 :e1002591 Crossref Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar ), but rather it may act at a step between germline and neuron function.
To test the notion that Cer1 might act in a post-germline, dynamic, transient step, we carried out RNAi starting in adulthood. First, knockdown of Cer1 in trained P0 adults ( Figure 5 F) blocked avoidance learning as well as whole-life RNAi treatment ( Figure 3 H), showing that Cer1 can be knocked down effectively in adults. Similarly, loss of Cer1 only in adults prevents the induction of daf-7p::gfp expression in the ASI ( Figure 5 G). Knockdown of Cer1 in trained P0 adults followed by treatment on control RNAi in F1 allowed the re-emergence of avoidance behavior ( Figures S6 A–S6D), further establishing that Cer1 is not involved in establishment of the transgenerational signal. Knockdown of Cer1 only in adults of the F2 generation abrogated behavior ( Figure 5 H; Figure S6 E), despite the F1 animals having demonstrated inheritance of avoidance ( Figures S6 B–S6D). Together, these results suggest that the process is dynamic: if the transgenerational inheritance of avoidance had been set by regulation of neuronal gene expression levels in the embryonic state, then knockdown of Cer1 should not have affected behavior. Instead, we see that Cer1 , which acts upstream of daf-7 in the ASI, dynamically regulates behavior in adult animals.
Together, these results show that loss of Cer1 does not erase transgenerational memory but rather is required downstream of the memory maintenance machinery in order to execute avoidance behavior. Thus, its role is unlikely to be solely in the germline but more likely in the communication of the status of avoidance state information from the germline to the neurons in every generation. This germline-to-soma signaling ( Figure 5 I) ultimately affects neuronal activity and behavior to avoid a common pathogen, and it also improves their survival on that pathogen ( Moore et al., 2019 33. Moore, R.S. ∙ Kaletsky, R. ∙ Murphy, C.T. Piwi/PRG-1 Argonaute and TGF-β Mediate Transgenerational Learned Pathogenic Avoidance Cell. 2019; 177 :1827-1841 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (152) PubMed Google Scholar ). Together, these functions might provide an evolutionary benefit from the insertion and activity of a retrotransposon that was previously thought to be solely deleterious.
Roughly 15% of the C. elegans genome consists of transposon genetic material ( Laricchia et al., 2017 25. Laricchia, K.M. ∙ Zdraljevic, S. ∙ Cook, D.E. ... Natural Variation in the Distribution and Abundance of Transposable Elements Across the Caenorhabditis elegans Species Mol. Biol. Evol. 2017; 34 :2187-2202 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ). The Ty3/Gypsy family retrotransposon Cer1 is one of these elements and is inserted into the genomes of roughly 70% of wild C. elegans strains ( Palopoli et al., 2008 36. Palopoli, M.F. ∙ Rockman, M.V. ∙ TinMaung, A. ... Molecular basis of the copulatory plug polymorphism in Caenorhabditis elegans Nature. 2008; 454 :1019-1022 Crossref Scopus (96) PubMed Google Scholar ), although the sites of these insertions differ—some are present in the plg-1 locus, which regulates “plugging” upon mating, while others are present elsewhere ( Laricchia et al., 2017 25. Laricchia, K.M. ∙ Zdraljevic, S. ∙ Cook, D.E. ... Natural Variation in the Distribution and Abundance of Transposable Elements Across the Caenorhabditis elegans Species Mol. Biol. Evol. 2017; 34 :2187-2202 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 6 A). Similarly, some Cer1 insertions are only remnants of the active transposon, with only LTRs (long terminal repeats) detectable ( Figure 6 A). Therefore, we wondered whether the presence of full-length Cer1 in the genomes of strains isolated from the wild is required for the ability to learn and remember pathogen avoidance.
An intact copy of Cer1 is present in the wild strain JU1580, as shown by the complete coverage of the coding sequences and LTRs by de novo assembly ( Cook et al., 2017 13. Cook, D.E. ∙ Zdraljevic, S. ∙ Roberts, J.P. ... CeNDR, the Caenorhabditis elegans natural diversity resource Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45 :D650-D657 Crossref Scopus (170) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S6 F). We found that like N2, JU1580 animals learn to avoid P. aeruginosa both through exposure to the pathogen ( Figure 6 B, left) and small RNAs ( Figure 6 B, right), as well as by exposure to E. coli +P11 (P11 training) ( Figure 6 C). Furthermore, trained JU1580 mothers can pass this information on to their progeny for four generations, just as N2 does ( Figures 6 D and 6E). These results suggest that the mechanisms underlying transgenerational inheritance of learned pathogen avoidance via small RNAs are conserved.
In contrast to our findings with JU1580, another C. elegans strain, CB4856 (“Hawaiian”), is unable to learn to avoid P. aeruginosa after lawn ( Figure 6 F) or E. coli +P11 training ( Figure 6 G) or to pass this information on to its progeny (F1). It was previously shown that Hawaiian does not have Cer1 inserted into its genome ( Palopoli et al., 2008 36. Palopoli, M.F. ∙ Rockman, M.V. ∙ TinMaung, A. ... Molecular basis of the copulatory plug polymorphism in Caenorhabditis elegans Nature. 2008; 454 :1019-1022 Crossref Scopus (96) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S6 G), but this is not the only difference between N2 and Hawaiian. CB4856 and N2 differentially survive on P. aeruginosa , and this difference is mediated by the npr-1 gene, which regulates leaving behavior in response to oxygen levels. However, the genomic region of npr-1 in JU1580 has the “wild” SNP of npr-1 , as Hawaiian does ( Cook et al., 2017 13. Cook, D.E. ∙ Zdraljevic, S. ∙ Roberts, J.P. ... CeNDR, the Caenorhabditis elegans natural diversity resource Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45 :D650-D657 Crossref Scopus (170) PubMed Google Scholar ), ruling out npr-1 as the source of the difference in pathogenic learning ability. Similarly, the maco-1 gene, which is downregulated upon exposure to P. aeruginosa and is required for learned P. aeruginosa avoidance behavior ( Kaletsky et al., 2020a 23. Kaletsky, R. ∙ Moore, R.S. ∙ Vrla, G.D. ... C. elegans interprets bacterial non-coding RNAs to learn pathogenic avoidance Nature. 2020; 586 :445-451 Crossref Scopus (95) PubMed Google Scholar ), is identical between N2 and Hawaiian in the 17 nucleotides of homology to P11 ( Figure S6 H), suggesting that Hawaiian’s inability to learn and pass on learned avoidance is not due to a lack of sequence matching between P11 small RNA and its maco-1 target.
To determine whether the presence of Cer1 correlates with the ability to learn pathogen avoidance more widely in nature, we examined the expression of Cer1 RNA via real-time PCR ( Figure 6 A) and the presence of Cer1 GAG protein via immunofluorescence ( Figure 6 H) in N2, JU1580, Hawaiian, and an additional nine wild strains of C. elegans , and then we tested the ability of these wild strains to carry out P11-mediated learned avoidance of P. aeruginosa . Like N2 and JU1580, the wild strains DH424 and KR314 expressed Cer1 RNA and Cer1 GAG protein and were able to learn P. aeruginosa avoidance after P11 training ( Figures 6 A, 6H, and 6I). Other strains behaved like Hawaiian, as they were unable to learn P11-induced avoidance and were defective for attraction to P. aeruginosa ( Figures 6 A); none of these strains had Cer1 inserted into the genome or expressed Cer1 at appreciable levels ( Figures 6 A and 6H) (although the twelfth strain, ED3040, has Cer1 inserted into its genome and expresses Cer1 , it is defective for normal attraction to P. aeruginosa and does not exhibit increased avoidance upon training). Finally, treatment of the Cer1 -expressing wild strain KR314 with Cer1 RNAi abolished its P11-mediated learning ( Figure 6 J). Thus, the presence and expression of Cer1 in wild strains of C. elegans largely correlates with ability to learn to avoid P. aeruginosa after small RNA-mediated training.
Since Cer1 is both highly prevalent in C. elegans wild isolates and capable of horizontal memory transfer from worm lysate, we wondered whether worms can secrete Cer1 into the environment, acting like an extracellular vesicle or virus rather than functioning solely intercellularly. To explore this possibility, we obtained Day 1 adult F2s derived from control or P11-trained grandmothers ( Figure S7 A) and cultured them in liquid with OP50 for 24 h ( Figure 7 A). We then filtered out the worms and bacteria and applied the CM to a fresh spot of OP50 to train naive worms. After 24 h of exposure to CM, worms were tested for PA14-avoidance behavior ( Figures 7 A and 7B). Strikingly, CM from worms that possess the memory of PA14 avoidance can transmit that memory to a naive population of worms, and CM-mediated horizontal memory transfer is Cer1 -dependent (P0, Figure 7 B). As we observed for Trizol-treated lysate fractions ( Figure 2 A), pre-treatment with detergent (1% Triton) prevented the conferral of behavior from conditioned media, suggesting that the information is protected by a lipid, as in a VLP ( Figure S7 B). Notably, C. elegans is able to distinguish this signal from other RNA that is abundant in the worms’ environment, despite its comparatively low abundance ( Figure S7 C). Consistent with CM-mediated acquisition of PA14-avoidance behavior, CM-treated worms upregulated daf-7 expression in the ASI neurons ( Figure 7 C). Worms that acquired PA14-avoidance behavior from CM were also able to transmit the memory transgenerationally to their progeny, as both F1 and F2 animals similarly avoid PA14 ( Figure 7 B).
Cer1 is required for CM-mediated horizontal memory transfer, suggesting that Cer1- containing VLPs are involved in transmitting the memory information. To rule out the contribution of other secreted factors that may be present in CM, we tested whether memory transfer requires pheromones. Pheromones are chemical signals that C. elegans secrete to communicate information about sex, mating potential, age, and competitors ( Chasnov et al., 2007 12. Chasnov, J.R. ∙ So, W.K. ∙ Chan, C.M. ... The species, sex, and stage specificity of a Caenorhabditis sex pheromone Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104 :6730-6735 Crossref Scopus (99) PubMed Google Scholar ; Shi et al., 2017 44. Shi, C. ∙ Runnels, A.M. ∙ Murphy, C.T. Mating and male pheromone kill Caenorhabditis males through distinct mechanisms eLife. 2017; 6 :e23493 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ). To test whether pheromones are required for horizontal memory transfer, we examined daf-22 mutants, which are defective in pheromone production ( Golden and Riddle, 1985 19. Golden, J.W. ∙ Riddle, D.L. A gene affecting production of the Caenorhabditis elegans dauer-inducing pheromone Mol. Gen. Genet. 1985; 198 :534-536 Crossref Scopus (71) PubMed Google Scholar ). Daf-22 mutants learned to avoid PA14 when trained on P11-expressing bacteria, and their progeny inherited the memory transgenerationally ( Figures S7 D and S7E). Lysate ( Figure S7 F) or CM from daf-22 mutant F1s was also able to train naive worms to avoid PA14 ( Figure 7 D), demonstrating that pheromones are not required for horizontal memory transfer.
We next determined the requirement for extracellular vesicles (EVs), which are membrane-wrapped structures that encapsulate a wide array of signaling molecule cargo and are abundantly secreted by C. elegans . EV biogenesis requires the p38 mitogen-activated MAPK (PMK-1) ( Wang et al., 2015 53. Wang, J. ∙ Kaletsky, R. ∙ Silva, M. ... Cell-Specific Transcriptional Profiling of Ciliated Sensory Neurons Reveals Regulators of Behavior and Extracellular Vesicle Biogenesis Curr. Biol. 2015; 25 :3232-3238 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ), so we tested whether pmk-1 mutants can transmit PA14 learned avoidance through CM. Similar to daf-22 mutants, pmk-1 mutant animals can learn to avoid PA14, vertically inherit the memory, and transfer the memory through lysate and the CM ( Figure 7 E; Figures S7 G–S7J). While PMK-1 is a major regulator of EV biogenesis in C. elegans , extracellular vesicle biogenesis can occur through alternative MAPK-independent pathways in other organisms ( van Niel et al., 2018 52. van Niel, G. ∙ D’Angelo, G. ∙ Raposo, G. Shedding light on the cell biology of extracellular vesicles Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2018; 19 :213-228 Crossref Scopus (4815) PubMed Google Scholar ); therefore we cannot entirely rule out the contribution of EVs in horizontal memory transfer. However, since our behavioral results were entirely dependent on the presence of Cer1 , our data suggest that neither pheromones nor EVs are the secreted factor that carry the memory and further support the direct involvement of secreted Cer1 VLPs in horizontal memory transfer.
To demonstrate that the Cer1 -dependent memory signal is not a small soluble factor, we purified and concentrated the CM using standard virus purification and ultracentrifugation techniques. The filtered CM was pelleted through a sucrose cushion, and the re-suspended pellet was used to train naive worms. Similar to the VLP fraction purified from worm lysate, RNase treatment of the CM yielded a small but protected population of RNA consisting mostly of species <200 nt but with RNA up to 1,000 nt ( Figure S7 K). Consistent with our previous results, the VLP fraction from the CM from wild-type worms induced PA14-avoidance behavior, while CM from Cer1 mutants did not ( Figure 7 F).

Section: Discussion

Here we have shown that information conveying pathogenic exposure status can be transferred from trained to naive C. elegans , via VLPs of Ty3/Gypsy Cer1 retrotransposon. Additionally, the transfer of this information induces memory that lasts for four additional generations, similar to training on P. aeruginosa or its small RNA, P11. Our results provide a molecular mechanism by which memory transmission might occur: the Cer1 retrotransposon expresses VLPs that can confer memory of learned pathogen avoidance to other individuals when secreted or when the animal is lysed and, within an individual, from germline to neurons. Thus, memories of learned avoidance of pathogens can be transferred between individuals and can induce transgenerational inheritance of the learned information. The fact that worms secrete a Cer1 -dependent signal into the environment that carries information about pathogen status suggests that Cer1 VLPs function as a form of communication to confer pathogen avoidance to naive relatives, with recipients restricted to those who also carry Cer1 in its genome. Thus, C. elegans has hijacked a potentially deleterious retrotransposon element for its own advantage, using the virus to protect its kin from infectious agents.
The idea that memory can be transferred between individuals is old but controversial. Reports of horizontally transferred memory in planarians ( McConnell et al., 1959 30. McConnell, J.V. ∙ Jacobson, A.L. ∙ Kimble, D.P. The effects of regeneration upon retention of a conditioned response in the planarian J. Comp. Physiol. Psychol. 1959; 52 :1-5 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ) seemed to contradict both the concept of memory storage occurring only at synapses and the strict protection of the germline from somatic changes proposed by Weismann in the late 1800s. These findings were more recently supported by an independent study in Planaria that used an automated system to reduce bias ( Shomrat and Levin, 2013 45. Shomrat, T. ∙ Levin, M. An automated training paradigm reveals long-term memory in planarians and its persistence through head regeneration J. Exp. Biol. 2013; 216 :3799-3810 Crossref Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, planaria divide asexually, and thus the concept of a Weismann barrier might be less strict. Furthermore, no molecular mechanism for this type of memory transfer has been determined. Another example of memory transfer between individuals is from recent work in Aplysia , in which the RNA extracted from the CNS of trained animals injected into naive animals was able to increase sensitization in a DNA methylation-dependent manner ( Bédécarrats et al., 2018 7. Bédécarrats, A. ∙ Chen, S. ∙ Pearce, K. ... RNA from Trained Aplysia Can Induce an Epigenetic Engram for Long-Term Sensitization in Untrained Aplysia eNeuro. 2018; 5 ENEURO.0038-18.2018 Crossref Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar ), an example of an epigenetic mechanism of memory storage, but whether this could happen in the wild or influence the behavior of progeny is unknown. Our results in C. elegans suggest that the Cer1 retrotransposon enables the transfer of a memory of a pathogen from germline to nervous system, between generations, and from animal to animal.
The fact that Cer1 ’s presence in wild strains of C. elegans correlates with the ability to learn and transgenerationally inherit pathogen avoidance suggests that Cer1 itself may have enabled the acquisition of this behavior. C. elegans dies within 2–3 days in the presence of P. aeruginosa , killing mothers before they have finished reproducing, which would deleteriously affect their fitness. Cer1 was previously noted to reduce fecundity in non-pathogenic conditions ( Dennis et al., 2012 14. Dennis, S. ∙ Sheth, U. ∙ Feldman, J.L. ... C. elegans germ cells show temperature and age-dependent expression of Cer1, a Gypsy/Ty3-related retrotransposon PLoS Pathog. 2012; 8 :e1002591 Crossref Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar ), but here we found that the presence of Cer1 enables the worms to learn to avoid Pseudomonas . If naive animals are able to take up Cer1 VLPs from animals who are infected, either through secretion of VLPs or by lysis, it would allow them to acquire learned avoidance without experiencing illness themselves ( Figure 7 G), effectively vaccinating them against future P. aeruginosa exposure by inducing avoidance behavior. Furthermore, as infected mothers often “bag” (die of matricide), the ability of other worms to take up Cer1 VLPs might provide them with the ability to avoid the pathogen. The ability to avoid pathogens for multiple generations could provide C. elegans that have acquired Cer1 an advantage in environments rife with pathogens, perhaps the first demonstration of the physiological relevance of such memory transfer.
Here, we have shown that rather than being solely deleterious ( Dennis et al., 2012 14. Dennis, S. ∙ Sheth, U. ∙ Feldman, J.L. ... C. elegans germ cells show temperature and age-dependent expression of Cer1, a Gypsy/Ty3-related retrotransposon PLoS Pathog. 2012; 8 :e1002591 Crossref Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar ), the presence of the Cer1 retrotransposon in fact may have been co-opted by C. elegans to help it survive in an environment that requires frequent encounters with pathogens. The ability of the Cer1 retrotransposon to confer a benefit to the host is surprising, considering the classical nature of transposons in genomes. Transposons are highly abundant in animal genomes and generally regarded as pernicious, mutagenic genetic elements whose mobility can lead to disease and the erosion of host fitness. Transposons incur damage to hosts on several fronts: through misregulation of host processes (such as interfering with host transcription), processing of mRNAs, and chromatin structure ( Elbarbary et al., 2016 17. Elbarbary, R.A. ∙ Lucas, B.A. ∙ Maquat, L.E. Retrotransposons as regulators of gene expression Science. 2016; 351 :aac7247 Crossref Scopus (264) PubMed Google Scholar ), or through disruption of the host genome through transposition. Consistent with other transposons, the presence of Cer1 was previously only noted to be deleterious, as its expression decreases fecundity and lifespan in non-pathogenic conditions ( Dennis et al., 2012 14. Dennis, S. ∙ Sheth, U. ∙ Feldman, J.L. ... C. elegans germ cells show temperature and age-dependent expression of Cer1, a Gypsy/Ty3-related retrotransposon PLoS Pathog. 2012; 8 :e1002591 Crossref Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar ). The finding that Cer1 is required for learned and transgenerationally inherited PA14-avoidance behavior shows that ancient retrotransposons can be co-opted and repurposed to benefit the worm, an example of transposon-host mutualism ( Feschotte and Gilbert, 2012 18. Feschotte, C. ∙ Gilbert, C. Endogenous viruses: insights into viral evolution and impact on host biology Nat. Rev. Genet. 2012; 13 :283-296 Crossref Scopus (479) PubMed Google Scholar ). Since retrotransposition in C. elegans has never observed under laboratory conditions ( Bessereau, 2006 9. Bessereau, J.-L. Transposons in C. elegans. WormBook Online Rev. C Elegans Biol. 2006; 1-13 Google Scholar ; Laricchia et al., 2017 25. Laricchia, K.M. ∙ Zdraljevic, S. ∙ Cook, D.E. ... Natural Variation in the Distribution and Abundance of Transposable Elements Across the Caenorhabditis elegans Species Mol. Biol. Evol. 2017; 34 :2187-2202 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ), it is likely that Cer1 mediates this acquired worm behavior independent of its potential for novel genome insertion as a retrotransposon.
While the domestication of transposons underlies some of the most critical transitions in animal evolution ( Agrawal et al., 1998 2. Agrawal, A. ∙ Eastman, Q.M. ∙ Schatz, D.G.

The pogo transposable element family of Drosophila melanogaster Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 232 :126-134 Crossref Scopus (100) PubMed Google Scholar ), the requirement for Cer1 in transgenerational learned behavior is unique in that Cer1 is an active transposon and that Cer1 confers a behavioral ability, avoidance, on the animals. An interesting parallel arises with comparison to recent studies of Arc (of Ty3/Gypsy family origin), which showed that Arc VLPs can transmit cellular genetic material across neurons in a process that underlies synaptic plasticity in fly and mammalian brains ( Ashley et al., 2018 4. Ashley, J. ∙ Cordy, B. ∙ Lucia, D. ...

The Neuronal Gene Arc Encodes a Repurposed Retrotransposon Gag Protein that Mediates Intercellular RNA Transfer Cell. 2018; 172 :275-288 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (330) PubMed Google Scholar ). While C. elegans lacks a direct Arc ortholog, Cer1 is also a member of the Ty3/Gypsy family and similarly forms capsids ( Dennis et al., 2012 14. Dennis, S. ∙ Sheth, U. ∙ Feldman, J.L. ... C. elegans germ cells show temperature and age-dependent expression of Cer1, a Gypsy/Ty3-related retrotransposon PLoS Pathog. 2012; 8 :e1002591 Crossref Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cer1 ’s role in pathogen avoidance, and specifically in the avoidance behavior step—rather than in generation or maintenance of the transgenerational memory—was surprising, given the fact that Cer1 produces VLPs in the germline; however, VLPs are also present in non-germline cells at lower abundance, perhaps suggesting at least a transient presence outside of the germline ( Dennis et al., 2012 14. Dennis, S. ∙ Sheth, U. ∙ Feldman, J.L. ... C. elegans germ cells show temperature and age-dependent expression of Cer1, a Gypsy/Ty3-related retrotransposon PLoS Pathog. 2012; 8 :e1002591 Crossref Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although it is possible that Cer1 acts like Arc, transmitting information between neurons, a more parsimonious explanation, given the abundance of Cer1 VLPs in the germline and our genetic evidence placing it upstream of daf-7 regulation in the ASI neuron, is that germline Cer1 VLPs carry host cargo to neurons, where subsequent changes in expression and activity modulate behavior ( Figure 5 C).
Our data suggest that C er1 functions in a dynamic germline-to-neuron signaling mechanism that may represent the co-option of retrotransposon function to improve C. elegans ’ survival and its progeny’s survival in pathogenic environments. Cer1 appears to provide C. elegans immediate protection from abundant pathogenic Pseudomonas species in its environment but also confers lasting generational benefits by communicating an adaptive immune signal of learned avoidance to its descendants. Moreover, the ability to provide memories of pathogen avoidance to neighboring worms might allow greater survival of its kin.
This study demonstrates that learned memories can be transmitted horizontally from trained to naive C. elegans via the Cer1 Ty3 retrotransposon. However, there are limitations to the current study that require further investigation. While we observed Cer1 protein present in VLPs, we do not have the resolution to determine whether Cer1 is forming a capsid structure inside of the membrane or upon secretion. Additional studies will be needed to examine the precise structure of Cer1 in these VLPs, as well as identifying the memory-containing cargo. The future challenge will be to determine how the Cer1-dependent VLP signal is transported across membranes and tissues within the worm and between worms. These studies are limited by the vanishingly small amount of RNA present in the samples (despite the high volumes of worms obtained for experimental inputs), the unknown size and modifications of the RNA memory signal (which can preclude incorporation into RNA sequencing libraries), the high level of rRNA and small nucleolar RNA present during high-throughput sequencing (up to 95% of the sample, Figure S7 K), and the presence of RNA contamination from the worms’ OP50 bacteria food source ( Figure S7 C).

This study did not generate new unique reagents.
Worm strains were provided by the C. elegans Genetics Center (CGC): N2 (wild type), FK181, CB4856 (Hawaiian), JU1580, KR314, DH424, MY2, JU363, JU323, ED3077, ED3040, ED3054, ED3073 and, CB4037, DR476, KU25, VC1119, and VC40895 ( gk870313 ) ( Cer1 mutant). VC40895 was outcrossed 6 times to generate CQ655. CQ655 was used for all the Cer1 mutant experiments reported in this paper. CQ655 was used to make CQ670 (see below).
Bacterial strains: P. aeruginosa PA14 was a gift from Z. Gitai. P. fluorescens 15 (Pf15) was a gift from M. Donia, OP50 was provided by the CGC, and Serratia marcescens (ATCC 274) was provided by the ATCC. Control ( L4440 ), Cer1 , Cer4 , daf-7 , and prg-1 RNAi clones were obtained from the Ahringer library and sequenced verified before use. E. coli expressing P11 was made as previously described ( Kaletsky et al., 2020a 23. Kaletsky, R. ∙ Moore, R.S. ∙ Vrla, G.D. ... C. elegans interprets bacterial non-coding RNAs to learn pathogenic avoidance Nature. 2020; 586 :445-451 Crossref Scopus (95) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Worm strains were maintained at 20°C on High Growth Media (HG) plates (3 g/L NaCl, 20 g/L Bacto-peptone, 30 g/L Bacto-agar in distilled water, with 4 mL/L cholesterol (5 mg/mL in ethanol), 1 mL/L 1M CaCl 2 , 1 mL/L 1M MgSO 4 , and 25 mL/L 1M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) added to molten agar after autoclaving) on E. coli OP50 using standard methods.
For all experiments using RNAi treated worms, worms were cultured on HG plates (supplemented with 1 mL/L 1M IPTG, and 1 mL/L 100 mg/mL carbenicillin). 1 h before use of RNAi plates, 200 μL of 0.1M IPTG was spotted onto seeded RNAi plates and left to dry at room temperature.
OP50 and P. aeruginosa PA14 were cultured overnight in autoclaved and cooled Luria Broth (10 g/L tryptone, 5 g/L yeast extract, 10 g/L NaCl in distilled water) shaking (250 rpm) at 37°C. E. coli strains expressing PA14 small RNAs were cultured overnight shaking (250 rpm) at 37°C in Luria Broth supplemented with final concentrations of 0.02% arabinose w/v and 100 μg/mL carbenicillin. E. coli RNAi strains were cultured overnight shaking (250 rpm) at 37°C in Luria Broth supplemented with filter sterilized (final concentration) 12.5 μg/mL tetracycline and 100 μg/mL carbenicillin. 10x concentrated OP50 (used in conditioned media preparation) was resuspended in autoclaved S-basal (5.85 g/L NaCl, 1 g/L K 2 HPO 4 , 6 g/L KH 2 PO 4 ) in MilliQ H 2 O, supplemented with 1 mL/L cholesterol (5 mg/mL in ethanol).
Worm preparation: Eggs from young adult hermaphrodites were obtained by bleaching and subsequently placed onto HG plates seeded with E. coli OP50 or HG RNAi plates seeded with RNAi and incubated at 20°C for 2 days. Synchronized L4 worms were used in all training experiments.
Bacteria lawn training plate preparation: Overnight cultures of bacteria (prepared as described above) were diluted in LB to an Optical Density (OD 600 ) = 1 and used to fully cover Nematode Growth Media (NGM) (3 g/L NaCl, 2.5 g/L Bacto-peptone, 17 g/L Bacto-agar in distilled water, with 1 mL/L cholesterol (5 mg/mL in ethanol), 1 mL/L 1M CaCl2, 1 mL/L 1M MgSO4, and 25 mL/L 1M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) added to molten agar after autoclaving) plates. For preparation of E. coli expressing PA14 P11 RNA, bacteria were seeded on NGM or HG plates supplemented with 0.02% arabinose and 100 μg/mL carbenicillin (final concentration). All plates were incubated for 2 days at 25°C unless specified otherwise (in separate incubators for control/pathogen seeded plates). On the day of training (i.e., 2 days post bleaching), plates were left to cool on a benchtop for 1 h to equilibrate to room temperature before the addition of worms. Additionally, for E. coli strains expressing PA14 small RNAs, 200 μL of 0.01% arabinose was spotted onto seeded training plates 1 h prior to use.
Synchronized L4 worms were washed off plates using M9 and left to pellet on the bench top for approximately 5 min. 5 μL of worms were placed onto small RNA-spotted training plates, while 10 μL or 40 μL of worms were plated onto OP50 or E. coli expressing PA14 small RNAs, or pathogen-seeded training plates, respectively. Worms were incubated on training plates at 20°C in separate containers for 24 h. After 24 h, worms were washed off plates using M9 and washed an additional 3 times to remove excess bacteria. Worms were tested in an aversive learning assay described below.
Overnight bacterial cultures were diluted in LB to an Optical Density (OD 600 ) = 1, and 25 μL of each bacterial suspension was spotted onto one side of a 60 mm NGM plate and incubated for 2 days at 25°C. After 2 days assay plates were left at room temperature for 1 h before use. Immediately before use, 1 μL of 1M sodium azide was spotted onto each respective bacteria spot to be used as a paralyzing agent during choice assay. To start the assay (modified from ( Zhang et al., 2005 55. Zhang, Y. ∙ Lu, H. ∙ Bargmann, C.I. Pathogenic bacteria induce aversive olfactory learning in Caenorhabditis elegans Nature. 2005; 438 :179-184 Crossref Scopus (583) PubMed Google Scholar )), worms were washed off training plates in M9 allowed to pellet by gravity, and washed 2 additional times in M9. 5 μL of worms were spotted at the bottom of the assay plate, using a wide orifice tip, midway between the bacterial lawns. Aversive learning assays were incubated at room temperature for 1 h before manually counting the number of worms on each lawn. Plating a large number of worms (> 200) on choice assay plates was avoided, since excess worms clump at bacterial spots making it difficult to distinguish animals, and high densities of worms can alter behavior. A detailed protocol is described in ( Moore et al., 2021 34. Moore, R.S. ∙ Kaletsky, R. ∙ Murphy, C.T. Protocol for transgenerational learned pathogen avoidance behavior assays in Caenorhabditis elegans STAR Protoc. 2021; 2 :100384 Crossref Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ).
In experiments in which each generation was treated with RNAi: Animals were washed off plates with M9 at Day 1 of adulthood. A subset of the pooled animals was subjected to an aversive learning assay, while the remaining worms were bleached to obtain eggs, which were then placed onto HG or HG RNAi plates and left at 20°C for 3 days before the next generation was tested.
Adult only RNAi: At the L4-stage, worms were washed off of OP50 plates with M9 and left to pellet on the bench. Worm pellets were washed two more times in M9. Worms were then pipetted with a large orifice pipette tip onto RNAi plates. Worms were left on RNAi plates for 24 h at 20°C. Following 24 h of RNAi exposure, worms were washed off RNAi plates with M9 and used the appropriate experiment, either training or behavior testing.
F2 worms from trained grandmothers were washed off of plates using M9. Three additional M9 washed were performed to remove excess bacteria, and the supernatant was discarded. 1 mL of Trizol LS was added per 100 μL of worm pellet. Worms were lysed in Trizol by incubation at 65°C for 10 min with occasional vortexing. RNA was extracted with chloroform, and the aqueous phase was used as input for RNA purification using the mirVana miRNA isolation kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions for total RNA. Approximately 100 μg of total RNA from either control or P11 grandmother-trained F2 worms was used per training plate. This amount of RNA was chosen as it correlates to the same input of worms used for training with worm lysate (see Preparation of Worm Lysates). Purified RNA was used immediately by dropping RNA onto pre-seeded spots of OP50 on NGM plates. Plates were allowed to air dry before the addition of naive worms for training. Worms were trained on RNA-seeded plates for 24 h at 20°C and subsequently tested for PA14 aversive learning using a standard choice assay.
Fastq files from SRA (accession numbers SRR9322509, SRR9322510, SRR9322511, SRR9322512, SRR9322514) were uploaded to Galaxy ( Afgan et al., 2018 1. Afgan, E. ∙ Baker, D. ∙ Batut, B. ... The Galaxy platform for accessible, reproducible and collaborative biomedical analyses: 2018 update Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46 :W537-W544 Crossref Scopus (2364) PubMed Google Scholar ) for analysis. De novo assembly of Illumina reads was performed using SPAdes ( Bankevich et al., 2012 5. Bankevich, A. ∙ Nurk, S. ∙ Antipov, D. ... SPAdes: a new genome assembly algorithm and its applications to single-cell sequencing J. Comput. Biol. 2012; 19 :455-477 Crossref Scopus (16432) PubMed Google Scholar ) (Galaxy wrapper version 3.12.0), and contigs were aligned to the C. elegans N2 strain genome (WBcel235) using minimap2 ( Li, 2018 27. Li, H. Minimap2: pairwise alignment for nucleotide sequences Bioinformatics. 2018; 34 :3094-3100 Crossref Scopus (5152) PubMed Google Scholar ). For structural variant detection, alignment of raw fastq reads to C. elegans was performed using BWA ( Li and Durbin, 2009 28. Li, H. ∙ Durbin, R. Fast and accurate short read alignment with Burrows-Wheeler transform Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :1754-1760 Crossref Scopus (31658) PubMed Google Scholar ), followed by analysis using Lumpy ( Layer et al., 2014 26. Layer, R.M. ∙ Chiang, C. ∙ Quinlan, A.R. ... LUMPY: a probabilistic framework for structural variant discovery Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :R84 Crossref Scopus (899) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Day 1 F2 progeny from control or P11-trained grandmothers were collected from plates and washed 3 times in M9. The worm pellet was washed with DPBS, and the pellet was resuspended in DPBS. Worms were homogenized using an all-glass Dounce tissue grinder, and homogenization was monitored using a microscope. Different worm lysates within an experiment were normalized to the starting amount of worms. For training naive worms with lysates from F2 animals, the normalized lysate was diluted 1:3 with DPBS, such that 400 μL of lysate was obtained for every 100 μL of starting worm pellet. 200 μL of lysate was immediately pipetted directly onto the bacterial spot of 10 cm NGM plate (seeded with 200 μL of an OP50 spot in the center of the plate, 2 days prior to the experiment). Worm lysates were allowed to air dry, and plates with lysates were monitored to ensure no worms were alive following homogenization. Naive Day 1 worms were then transferred to lysate-seeded plates for 24 h of training at 20°C, followed by testing for learned avoidance using the standard OP50 v. PA14 choice assay.
Homogenates were prepared as described (Preparation of worm lysates) and cleared from debris by a 750 x g centrifugation at 4°C for 5 min. Homogenization and clearing steps were repeated twice. The homogenates were then passed twice through a 0.22 μm filter. For each sample, the homogenate protein concentration was measured using Quant-iT Protein Assay Kit. Per experiment, if needed, the homogenates were diluted in DPBS in order to load similar concentrations. From each sample, a small aliquot was kept as a “load” sample, and 830 μL was layered on top of an Iodixanol gradient. For each gradient- 5%, 11%, 17%, 24% and 30% Iodixanol solutions were made by mixing solution A (0.1 M NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.4) with solution B [50% Iodixanol solution, 0.5 mM EDTA, and 50 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.4]. The gradient was made in a 5 mL, Open-Top Thinwall Ultra-Clear Tube from equal volumes (830 μL) of each Iodixanol solution that were allowed to diffuse by an overnight incubation at 4°C. Samples were then centrifuged at 112,000 x g (4°C) for 2 h, using SW55 Ti Swinging-Bucket Rotor. Six fractions of equal volumes were collected. In addition to fraction 6, fractions 1 and 3 were chosen for further analysis because they appeared de-enriched for Cer1 and more enriched for other cellular components based on the western blot ( Figure 3 C). The Cer1-enriched fraction (fraction 6), as well as fraction 3, were diluted in DPBS and centrifuged at 335,000 x g (4°C) for 30 min. Each pellet was then resuspended in DPBS and used for western blots, naive worm training, or electron microscopy. For each experiment, the enrichment of Cer1 in fraction 6 was verified by western blot. For fractions treated with RNase, 1:1000 RNaseA was added following resuspension in PBS after the final spin, and samples were incubated for 15 min at room temperature. For behavior experiments with RNase-treated samples, the reaction was terminated by adding RNase inhibitor (1 unit final).
5 μl of sample from fraction 6 that was purified from worm lysates was applied to glow-discharged grids, washed once with ultrapure water, and stained with 0.75% uranyl formate. Images were collected with a Talos F200X Transmission Electron Microscope with CCD camera at 200 keV.
Immunogold labeling protocol was adjusted from ( Gulati et al., 2019 20. Gulati, N.M. ∙ Torian, U. ∙ Gallagher, J.R. ... Immunoelectron Microscopy of Viral Antigens Curr. Protoc. Microbiol. 2019; 53 :e86 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ); 5 μl of samples were applied to glow-discharged grids, washed once with ultrapure water. Grids were then washed three times with 0.1 M Tris HCl, pH 7.4, and samples were permeabilized by adding 0.1% Triton X-100 and incubating for 10 min at room temperature. Blocking was performed for 30 min at room temperature in blocking buffer [0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, 0.3% (v/v) bovine serum albumin, IgG free], followed by 60 min incubation with anti-Cer1 GAG antibody in blocking buffer (1:25 dilution). Grids were then washed five times with wash buffer [0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, 0.03% (v/v) bovine serum albumin, IgG free], and were next incubated with goat Anti-Mouse IgG (whole molecule)-Gold antibody (10 nm colloidal gold) (1:20 dilution) for 60 min. Each grid was then washed five times in wash buffer, and then washed three times in distilled water. Staining and imaging were performed as described in Negative-stain Electron Microscopy.
Conditioned media was prepared by obtaining F2 progeny from control or P11-trained grandmothers. Day 1 adult worms were washed off of maintenance plates using M9. The worm pellet was washed 1x in M9, and the supernatant was removed. For every 50 μL of worm pellet, 300 μL of S-Basal media supplemented with 10X OP50 was added. 1.5 mL of the worm and S-Basal/OP50 solution was transferred to each well of a 6-well plate and allowed to incubate for 24 h at 20°C. After 24 h, plates were inspected for worm health. We confirmed that no worms had exploded, bagged, or died. Conditioned media was harvested using wide-orifice pipette tips and pooled into 15 mL or 50 mL conical tubes. The media was cleared from bacteria and progeny by a 6500 x g centrifugation at room temperature for 10 min. The media were then passed through a 0.22 μm filter. Unconcentrated conditioned media was used immediately to train worms. 200 μL of conditioned media was placed directly on the OP50 spot on a pre-prepared 10 cm plate seeded with 250 μL OP50 the previous day. The conditioned media was allowed to dry at room temperature before the addition of 5 μL of L4 worms pipetted from a washed worm pellet using wide-orifice tips. Worms were trained for 24 h at 20°C before testing PA14 avoidance behavior or bleaching to obtain progeny.
To purify and concentrate VLPs from the conditioned media, the filtered media was treated with 1:1000 RNaseA and samples were incubated for 15 min at room temperature. 5-9 mL of conditioned media was then layered on top of a 25% sucrose cushion (5 mL, diluted in S-basal) in a 17 mL, Open-Top Thinwall Ultra-Clear Tube and was then centrifuged at 20,000 rpm (72,900 x g) (4°C) for 2.5 h, using a SW32Ti (with SW32.1Ti adapters) Swinging-Bucket Rotor. Pellets were then washed in DPBS and centrifuged again at 20,000 rpm (4°C) for 30 min. Final pellets were resuspended in 400-600 μL of S-basal, and subsequently 200 μL was placed onto a pre-seeded OP50 spot for worm training, as performed for the unconcentrated conditioned media.
For western blot analysis, samples were mixed with 10X Bolt Sample Reducing Agent and 4X Bolt LDS Sample Buffer. Samples were then heated at 70°C for 10 min before loading on a gradient-PAGE (4% −12%) Bis-Tris gel. After their separation, samples were transferred to a PVDF membrane and blocked with 5% milk in TBST (10X TBST: 200 mM Tris- HCl, pH 7.5, 1.5 M NaCl, 1% Tween20). Membranes were incubated with one of the following primary antibodies: anti-Cer1 GAG (1:150 dilution), rabbit polyclonal anti-Histone H3 (1:1000 dilution), mouse monoclonal anti- ATP5A (1:1000 dilution), mouse monoclonal anti- Hsp90 (1:1000 dilution). After washing with 1x TBST, membranes were incubated with the corresponding fluorescent secondary antibody (either goat anti-rabbit IgG, or goat anti- mouse IgG). Membranes were then washed with 1x TBST and imaged on ODYSSEY CLx.
Signals were quantified using LI-COR Image Studio; background was reduced from each signal, and each signal was normalized to the alpha-tubulin loading control.
All daf-7p::gfp images were taken on a Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope. Differential inference contrast (DIC) images of whole worms following OP50, or PA14 lawn or small RNA training, were imaged at 20 × . Z -stack multi-channel (DIC and GFP) of day-1 adult GFP-transgenic worms were imaged every 1 μm at 60 × magnification; Maximum intensity projections and 3D reconstructions of head neurons were built with Nikon NIS-Elements. To quantify daf-7p::gfp levels, worms were prepared and treated as described in ‘Worm preparation for training’. Worms were mounted on agar pads and immobilized using 1 mM levamisole. GFP was imaged at 60 × magnification and quantified using NIS-Elements software. Average pixel intensity was measured in each worm by drawing a Bezier outline of the neuron cell body for 2 ASI head neurons.
Antibody staining of C. elegans gonads was performed according to ( Shaham, 2006 42. Shaham, S. Methods in cell biology WormBook. 2006; Crossref Google Scholar ). Day 1 hermaphrodites were suspended in M9 on a glass slide and gonads were dissected. Slides were freeze-cracked on dry-ice, fixed for 5 min in cold MeOH/5 min in EtOH, and washed 3x in PBST. Primary antibodies used: anti- Cer1 -GAG (1:50), and anti-Histone H3 (Abcam, 1:200). Secondary antibodies used: goat anti-mouse AlexaFluor 488-labeled IgG (1:500), goat-anti rabbit AlexaFluor 555-labeled IgG (1:500). Both primary and secondary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4°C. Images were taken at 40x or 100x on a Nikon A1 confocal. Levels were set for the N2 positive control, and each germline was imaged at the same settings. Images were processed through NIS-Elements. Each image is a 12-22 image stack superimposed as a maximum projection.
The Cer1 open reading frame was cloned into the pDONR221 entry vector using BP recombination. The final destination vector was generated by recombining the unc-119 promoter, the Cer1 ORF, and the unc-54 3¢UTR. The unc-119p::Cer1::unc-54 3¢UT R plasmid was injected into the Cer1( gk870313 ) mutant strain CQ655 at 10 ng/μl with 1 ng/μl of myo2p::gfp to create strain CQ670. Rescue of Cer1 expression was confirmed by western blot.
For the comparison of choice indices between two genotypes or treatment conditions (i.e., Control versus P11 trained animals), two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison test was used. For the comparison of choice indices in which only one genotype was tested (i.e., wild-type only), unpaired t tests were performed. For the comparison of learning indices between generations (i.e., wild-type only), one way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison test was used. For quantification of neuron intensity, two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison test was used.
Populations of worms were raised together under identical conditions and were randomly distributed into treatment conditions. Trained worms were pooled and randomly chosen for choice assays. For all choice assays, each dot represents an individual choice assay plate (about 10–300 worms per plate) with all data shown from at least 3 independent replicates ( Table S1 ). Plates were excluded that contained less than 10 total worms per plate.
In all box-and-whiskey plots: the box extends from the 25th to the 75th percentile, with whiskers from the minimum to the maximum values. All figures in the Article and Supplementary Information pooled data from independent experiments. Statistics were generated using Prism 8; software used for genomic analysis are described in the Methods Details section of the STAR methods. Counting of worms on choice assay plates was performed blind with respect to worm genotype and training condition. Additional statistical details of experiments, including sample size can be found in figure legends and Table S1 .
