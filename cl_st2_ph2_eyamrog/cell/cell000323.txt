Title: Structures of HCMV Trimer reveal the basis for receptor recognition and cell entry


Abstract: Summary

Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infects the majority of the human population and represents the leading viral cause of congenital birth defects. HCMV utilizes the glycoproteins gHgLgO (Trimer) to bind to platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRα) and transforming growth factor beta receptor 3 (TGFβR3) to gain entry into multiple cell types. This complex is targeted by potent neutralizing antibodies and represents an important candidate for therapeutics against HCMV. Here, we determine three cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of the trimer and the details of its interactions with four binding partners: the receptor proteins PDGFRα and TGFβR3 as well as two broadly neutralizing antibodies. Trimer binding to PDGFRα and TGFβR3 is mutually exclusive, suggesting that they function as independent entry receptors. In addition, Trimer-PDGFRα interaction has an inhibitory effect on PDGFRα signaling. Our results provide a framework for understanding HCMV receptor engagement, neutralization, and the development of anti-viral strategies against HCMV.

Section: Introduction

Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a member of the Betaherpesvirinae sub-family of Herpesviridae that establishes a life-long infection in more than 70% of the human population ( Ho, 1990 18. Ho, M. Epidemiology of cytomegalovirus infections Rev. Infect. Dis. 1990; 12 :S701-S710 Crossref Scopus (317) PubMed Google Scholar ). After primary infection, HCMV becomes latent and its reactivation causes severe morbidity and mortality in individuals who are immune-suppressed or undergoing organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( Gallant et al., 1992 15. Gallant, J.E. ∙ Moore, R.D. ∙ Richman, D.D. ... Incidence and natural history of cytomegalovirus disease in patients with advanced human immunodeficiency virus disease treated with zidovudine J. Infect. Dis. 1992; 166 :1223-1227 Crossref Scopus (543) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kotton, 2010 24. Kotton, C.N. Management of cytomegalovirus infection in solid organ transplantation Nat. Rev. Nephrol. 2010; 6 :711-721 Crossref Scopus (96) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kuppermann et al., 1993 25. Kuppermann, B.D. ∙ Petty, J.G. ∙ Richman, D.D. ... Correlation between CD4+ counts and prevalence of cytomegalovirus retinitis and human immunodeficiency virus-related noninfectious retinal vasculopathy in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome Am. J. Ophthalmol. 1993; 115 :575-582 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (324) PubMed Google Scholar ). HCMV is also particularly threatening during pregnancy due to its ability to cross the placental barrier and infect the fetus. HCMV infection affects 0.3%–2.3% of newborns, representing the leading viral cause of congenital birth defects, including brain damage, hearing loss, learning disabilities, heart diseases, and mental retardation ( Hyde et al., 2010 20. Hyde, T.B. ∙ Schmid, D.S. ∙ Cannon, M.J. Cytomegalovirus seroconversion rates and risk factors: implications for congenital CMV Rev. Med. Virol. 2010; 20 :311-326 Crossref Scopus (199) PubMed Google Scholar ). For these reasons, HCMV has been identified as a top priority disease target by the Institute of Medicine ( Schleiss, 2011 44. Schleiss, M.R. Could therapeutic vaccination of cytomegalovirus-seropositive persons prevent reinfection and congenital virus transmission? J. Infect. Dis. 2011; 203 :1513-1516 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ). During the past decades, significant efforts have been established to develop vaccine candidates against HCMV infection. However, results from recent clinical trials indicated that HCMV vaccines showed only modest efficacy in preventing viral infection ( Anderholm et al., 2016 2. Anderholm, K.M. ∙ Bierle, C.J. ∙ Schleiss, M.R. Cytomegalovirus Vaccines: Current Status and Future Prospects Drugs. 2016; 76 :1625-1645 Crossref Scopus (86) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, the development of effective vaccines and therapeutics against HCMV represents an important unmet medical need. An effective vaccine or anti-viral therapeutic should target the early steps of the HCMV infection cycle, including viral entry into host-cells. The HCMV cell entry process can be described in two steps: receptor binding and membrane fusion ( Nguyen and Kamil, 2018 34. Nguyen, C.C. ∙ Kamil, J.P. Pathogen at the gates: Human cytomegalovirus entry and cell tropism Viruses. 2018; 10 :E704 Crossref Scopus (104) PubMed Google Scholar ). HCMV uses three envelope glycoprotein complexes to enter different cell lines: the gHgLgO (Trimer) and the gHgLpUL128-131A (Pentamer), as well as glycoprotein B (gB) ( Sinzger, 2008 48. Sinzger, C. Entry route of HCMV into endothelial cells J. Clin. Virol. 2008; 41 :174-179 Crossref Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ). HCMV Trimer or Pentamer binding to cellular host receptors provide the triggering signal for the HCMV glycoprotein gB to catalyze membrane fusion between the virus and infected cells, through an unknown mechanism ( Nguyen and Kamil, 2018 34. Nguyen, C.C. ∙ Kamil, J.P. Pathogen at the gates: Human cytomegalovirus entry and cell tropism Viruses. 2018; 10 :E704 Crossref Scopus (104) PubMed Google Scholar ). This fusion allows HCMV to enter cells, replicate, and establish its latency.
HCMV exhibits a broad cellular tropism, including fibroblasts, monocytes, macrophages, neurons, epithelial, and endothelial cells ( Sinzger, 2008 48. Sinzger, C. Entry route of HCMV into endothelial cells J. Clin. Virol. 2008; 41 :174-179 Crossref Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ) via interactions with structurally and functionally distinct receptor proteins ( Martinez-Martin et al., 2018 31. Martinez-Martin, N. ∙ Marcandalli, J. ∙ Huang, C.S. ... An Unbiased Screen for Human Cytomegalovirus Identifies Neuropilin-2 as a Central Viral Receptor Cell. 2018; 174 :1158-1171.e19 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (150) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although recent evidence suggested a primary role of the trimer complex for the infection of all cell types ( Stegmann et al., 2017 50. Stegmann, C. ∙ Hochdorfer, D. ∙ Lieber, D. ... A derivative of platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha binds to the trimer of human cytomegalovirus and inhibits entry into fibroblasts and endothelial cells PLoS Pathog. 2017; 13 :e1006273 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ), the trimer-mediated infection of fibroblasts has been best studied and involves the interaction of the trimer with PDGFRα, a member of the receptor tyrosine kinase 3 (RTK3) family ( Kabanova et al., 2016 22. Kabanova, A. ∙ Marcandalli, J. ∙ Zhou, T. ... Platelet-derived growth factor-α receptor is the cellular receptor for human cytomegalovirus gHgLgO trimer Nat. Microbiol. 2016; 1 :16082 Crossref Scopus (141) PubMed Google Scholar ; Martinez-Martin et al., 2018 31. Martinez-Martin, N. ∙ Marcandalli, J. ∙ Huang, C.S. ...

Wu, Y. ∙ Prager, A. ∙ Boos, S. ... Human cytomegalovirus glycoprotein complex gH/gL/gO uses PDGFR-α as a key for entry PLoS Pathog. 2017; 13 :e1006281 Crossref Scopus (117) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, TGFβR3 was found to bind the HCMV Trimer with high affinity, representing an additional putative cellular receptor mediating HCMV broad tropism ( Martinez-Martin et al., 2018 31. Martinez-Martin, N. ∙ Marcandalli, J. ∙ Huang, C.S. ... An Unbiased Screen for Human Cytomegalovirus Identifies Neuropilin-2 as a Central Viral Receptor Cell. 2018; 174 :1158-1171.e19 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (150) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Importantly, highly potent neutralizing antibodies targeting HCMV have been isolated from the memory B cell repertoire of HCMV immune donors ( Macagno et al., 2010 29. Macagno, A. ∙ Bernasconi, N.L. ∙ Vanzetta, F. ... Isolation of human monoclonal antibodies that potently neutralize human cytomegalovirus infection by targeting different epitopes on the gH/gL/UL128-131A complex J. Virol. 2010; 84 :1005-1013 Crossref Scopus (296) PubMed Google Scholar ). Most recently, high-throughput screening of 9,000 HCMV-seropositive blood donors identified exceptionally potent neutralizing antibodies able to block infection in fibroblasts and thought to be particularly active against the HCMV Trimer ( Falk et al., 2018 12. Falk, J.J. ∙ Winkelmann, M. ∙ Stöhr, D. ... Identification of elite neutralizers with broad and potent neutralizing activity against human cytomegalovirus (hcmv) in a population of hcmv-seropositive blood donors J. Infect. Dis. 2018; 218 :876-885 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ). The identification of these potent trimer neutralizing antibodies together with the requirement of the trimer for HCMV infection into all cell types ( Liu et al., 2018 28. Liu, J. ∙ Jardetzky, T.S. ∙ Chin, A.L. ... The Human Cytomegalovirus Trimer and Pentamer Promote Sequential Steps in Entry into Epithelial and Endothelial Cells at Cell Surfaces and Endosomes J. Virol. 2018; 92 :e01336-18 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ) highlights the key importance of the trimer for HCMV infection and suggests targeting the trimer for vaccine and anti-viral therapeutic development.
While opening new paths for targeting HCMV, the discovery of new HCMV receptors has highlighted the need for structural information identifying key regions on these complexes involved in receptor recognition and HCMV neutralization. In the past, mass spectrometry or negative staining electron microscopy were used to characterize the architecture of the trimer and pentamer at low resolution ( Ciferri et al., 2015a 8. Ciferri, C. ∙ Chandramouli, S. ∙ Donnarumma, D. ... Structural and biochemical studies of HCMV gH/gL/gO and Pentamer reveal mutually exclusive cell entry complexes Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112 :1767-1772 Crossref Scopus (122) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although the crystal structure of the pentamer has been determined recently ( Chandramouli et al., 2017 4. Chandramouli, S. ∙ Malito, E. ∙ Nguyen, T. ... Structural basis for potent antibody-mediated neutralization of human cytomegalovirus Sci. Immunol. 2017; 2 :eaan1457 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ), high-resolution structures of the trimer as well as any receptor bound to HCMV glycoprotein complexes are still elusive.
Here, we utilized cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and single particle reconstruction to determine the high-resolution structure of HCMV Trimer bound to two broadly neutralizing antibodies. The structure provides a detailed view of trimer organization, and in particular of the architecture of the gO subunit, highlighting differences between the trimer and pentamer and providing insights into HCMV broad neutralization. Furthermore, we determined the high-resolution structures of Trimer-PDGFRα and Trimer-TGFβR3 complexes and provide structural insights for the high affinity and specificity of interactions required for HCMV receptor recognition. We find that the trimer interaction with PDGFRα and TGFβR3 receptors is mutually exclusive, indicating that they do not function as co-receptors, but rather they might function as independent entry receptors. We further show that the trimer competes with the PDGF-AA growth factor for binding to PDGFRα and prevents activation of PDGFRα and the intracellular signaling cascade. We discuss potential consequences of using the HCMV Trimer itself as anti-viral therapeutic by assaying PDGFRα activation and signaling in fibroblasts. Taken together, we present the structural basis for HCMV Trimer-receptor recognition and provide a framework for the design of effective HCMV Trimer vaccines and therapeutics.

Section: Results

To determine the high-resolution structure of HCMV Trimer, we recombinantly expressed the soluble region of gHgLgO complex in Expi293F cells and purified the complex to high purity ( Figure S1 A). Consistent with previous reports, HCMV gH, gL, and gO were covalently linked by disulfide bonds and ran as a single band by SDS-PAGE ( Figure S1 B) ( Ciferri et al., 2015a 8. Ciferri, C. ∙ Chandramouli, S. ∙ Donnarumma, D. ... Structural and biochemical studies of HCMV gH/gL/gO and Pentamer reveal mutually exclusive cell entry complexes Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112 :1767-1772 Crossref Scopus (122) PubMed Google Scholar ). HCMV gHgLgO structural characterization has proven challenging in the past due to its flexibility, elongated nature, and its numerous glycosylation sites, likely hampering the formation of crystals that diffract to high-resolution ( Ciferri et al., 2015a 8. Ciferri, C. ∙ Chandramouli, S. ∙ Donnarumma, D. ... Structural and biochemical studies of HCMV gH/gL/gO and Pentamer reveal mutually exclusive cell entry complexes Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112 :1767-1772 Crossref Scopus (122) PubMed Google Scholar ). To overcome these limitations we turned to cryo-EM and single particle analysis after reconstituting gHgLgO with the fragment antigen-binding (Fab) regions of the gH-specific neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) 13H11 and MSL-109 ( Figures S1 A–S1I) ( Fouts et al., 2014 14. Fouts, A.E. ∙ Comps-Agrar, L. ∙ Stengel, K.F. ... Mechanism for neutralizing activity by the anti-CMV gH/gL monoclonal antibody MSL-109 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111 :8209-8214 Crossref Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar ; Macagno et al., 2010 29. Macagno, A. ∙ Bernasconi, N.L. ∙ Vanzetta, F. ... Isolation of human monoclonal antibodies that potently neutralize human cytomegalovirus infection by targeting different epitopes on the gH/gL/UL128-131A complex J. Virol. 2010; 84 :1005-1013 Crossref Scopus (296) PubMed Google Scholar ). Binding of both Fabs increased the stability and dimensions of the gHgLgO complex and facilitated cryo-EM investigation ( Figures S1 C and S1D). Two-dimensional class averages showed a high degree of detail including secondary structure features and particles imaged in numerous different orientations ( Figure S1 D). Additionally, we noticed a subpopulation of dimeric gHgLgO particles in the 2D classes and 3D ab initio volumes ( Figures S1 D and S1E), orientated head-to-tail in opposing directions with only a few small contact regions at the interface. The head-to-tail orientation of these particles, corresponding to a positioning of viral membranes at opposing ends of the complex, and the fact that these dimers form only at high concentration, suggested that trimer dimerization might not be of physiological relevance. We then determined the high-resolution structure of the single gHgLgO-13H11-MSL-109 complex that extended to a resolution of ∼2.9 Å, ( Figures 1 A and S1 F–S1I; Table S1 ). We divided the complex into three sub-regions to further improve the map quality across the entire gHgLgO-13H11-MSL-109 molecule using specific masks in focused local refinements ( Figure S1 F). The combination of the focused 3D reconstructions allowed us to build a structural model of the majority of the sequences of the gH, gL, and the previously unknown gO subunits as well as the variable domains (Fv) of both Fabs ( Figures 1 A and 1B).
The overall structure of the HCMV Trimer gHgLgO adopts a boot-like architecture with approximate dimensions of 170 Å in length and 70 Å in width ( Figure 1 B). The three subunits interact in a linear order, where the gL subunits bridge the gH and gO subunits in the center of the complex ( Figures 1 A and 1B). The electrostatic surface charge is distributed asymmetrically across the gHgLgO complex with a negative charge cluster at the proximal viral membrane (VM) gH region and a positive charge cluster at the distal VM gO region of the complex ( Figure 1 C). Similarly, the 19 observed N-linked glycosylation sites are distributed asymmetrically along the gHgLgO complex with 5 on gH, 1 on gL, and 13 on gO. This remarkable enrichment of glycosylated residues at the distal gO region is particularly striking along the back side of complex ( Figure 1 D). In contrast, the front side of the trimer complex appears to lack glycosylated residues in all three subunits ( Figure 1 D). Such asymmetric distribution of surface charge and glycosylation will have important implications for the receptor interactions.
Both Trimer and Pentamer share their gH and gL subunits but differ in the composition of the distal subunits (gO and UL128/UL130/UL131A, respectively), which mediate receptor recognition ( Ciferri et al., 2015a 8. Ciferri, C. ∙ Chandramouli, S. ∙ Donnarumma, D. ... Structural and biochemical studies of HCMV gH/gL/gO and Pentamer reveal mutually exclusive cell entry complexes Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112 :1767-1772 Crossref Scopus (122) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the trimer, the four gH domains (DI–DIV) extend linearly away from the membrane proximal face, where the N-terminal region of gH (D1) co-folds with gL near the membrane distal region of the molecule ( Figures 1 A, 1B, and S2 ). Structural comparison of the gHgL subunits between the trimer structure reported herein and the crystal structure of the pentamer bound to the UL130-specific neutralizing Fab 8I21 ( Chandramouli et al., 2017 4. Chandramouli, S. ∙ Malito, E. ∙ Nguyen, T. ... Structural basis for potent antibody-mediated neutralization of human cytomegalovirus Sci. Immunol. 2017; 2 :eaan1457 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ), reveals almost identical structures for gH and gL in both complexes (root-mean-square deviation [RMSD] 0.8 Å/777 Cα) ( Figure 2 A). Accordingly, most glycosylated residues on gH and gL point in the same directions for the trimer and pentamer with the exception of residue N641 on gH, which is found in a poorly resolved region of the trimer structure ( Figure 2 B).
We previously established that gO and UL128/UL130/UL131A bind to the same site on gHgL through formation of a disulfide bond with gL-C144 ( Ciferri et al., 2015a 8. Ciferri, C. ∙ Chandramouli, S. ∙ Donnarumma, D. ... Structural and biochemical studies of HCMV gH/gL/gO and Pentamer reveal mutually exclusive cell entry complexes Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112 :1767-1772 Crossref Scopus (122) PubMed Google Scholar ), but the details of how the trimer- and pentamer-specific proteins can form a very stable interaction to the same gL interface had remained mysterious. An in-depth structural comparison of the individual gH domains and the gL subunit between Trimer and Pentamer confirm the expected high degree of structural similarity. Despite this overall similarity, we observed a key difference at the most distal end of the gL subunit, which interacts with either gO in the trimer or the UL128 and UL130 subunits in the pentamer ( Figures 2 C–2F). gO binds as a capping crown around gL, covering ∼2,400 Å 2 of its surface ( Figure S2 B). The interaction surface between gL and gO spans a larger area than the corresponding interfaces between gL and either Ul128 (∼1,020 Å 2 ) or UL130 (∼910 Å 2 ) in HCMV Pentamer ( Figure S2 B). A comparison between Trimer and Pentamer shows that, although the overall fold of gL is conserved, there are differences in the organization of the residues centered around the key C144 residue. Notably, in the trimer, this stretch of residues assumes a loop-like structure ( Figures 2 C and 2D), whereas in the pentamer, this region folds into a regular alpha-helix to coordinate UL128 binding ( Figures 2 E and 2F). Therefore, gL emerges as a key adaptor protein that has evolved to be able to recognize both gO or UL128/UL130 proteins through a structural switch centered around gL C144 to load the HCMV viral surface with trimer or pentamer complexes, determining cellular tropism.
An important goal of HCMV research is to understand the structural basis and mechanism of action of broadly neutralizing mAbs. Notably, mAbs isolated from healthy HCMV seropositive donors that target conformation-dependent epitopes of HCMV Pentamer and Trimer have been previously reported ( Falk et al., 2018 12. Falk, J.J. ∙ Winkelmann, M. ∙ Stöhr, D. ...

Among these, MSL-109 and 13H11 target gH in both HCMV Trimer and Pentamer complexes and are capable of broad HCMV neutralization ( Macagno et al., 2010 29. Macagno, A. ∙ Bernasconi, N.L. ∙ Vanzetta, F. ... Isolation of human monoclonal antibodies that potently neutralize human cytomegalovirus infection by targeting different epitopes on the gH/gL/UL128-131A complex J.

Here, our structure of the HCMV Trimer gHgLgO-13H11-MSL-109 complex resolves the Fv regions of both Fabs and their corresponding epitopes on gH to high resolution ( Figures 1 A, 3 A, and S1 G).
13H11 and MSL-109 bind on opposite faces of the kinked C-terminal region of gH. Using both heavy and light chains, 13H11 recognizes a large footprint of gH DII–DIII domains ( Figures 3 B and 3C). Specifically, 13H11 heavy chain engages residues R223, D241, and D243 on gH DII domain through polar interactions ( Figure 3 D). The light chain of 13H11 establishes polar contacts with the R329, L218, and T387 residues on gH-DII domain as well as residues S553, S556, H530, and E576 on gH-DIII domain ( Figures 3 E and 3F). In contrast to 13H11, MSL-109 utilizes only its heavy chain to bind to the heel region of gH, recognizing a relatively small footprint of the DIII–DIV domains. The MSL-109 interactions involve polar contacts between its CDRs and residues W167, M168, P170 and D445 of gH-DIII and DIV domains. Notably, mutation of some of the residues in the epitope contacted by MSL-109 (W167C/R, P170S/H, and D445N) had been shown to lead to neutralization escape from this antibody, isolated by growing HCMV VR1814 virus in epithelial cells or fibroblasts under subneutralizing MSL-109 antibody concentrations ( Fouts et al., 2014 14. Fouts, A.E. ∙ Comps-Agrar, L. ∙ Stengel, K.F. ... Mechanism for neutralizing activity by the anti-CMV gH/gL monoclonal antibody MSL-109 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111 :8209-8214 Crossref Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our structure significantly expands our knowledge of the 13H11 and MSL-109 epitopes previously characterized by mass spectrometry methods ( Ciferri et al., 2015b 9. Ciferri, C. ∙ Chandramouli, S. ∙ Leitner, A. ...

The glycoprotein gO represents one of the most enigmatic subunits of HCMV because structure modeling based on its amino acidic sequence does not resemble any previously solved structures. In our cryo-EM structure, gO adopts a claw-like shape that is comprised of one N- and one C-terminal domain ( Figure 4 A). The gO N-terminal globular domain consists of five beta strands, whereas the C-terminal domain is mainly α-helical ( Figures 4 A and 4B). Remarkably, the central four alpha helices of the C-terminal domain share high structural similarities to a classical cytokine fold, with the closest member being FLT3 ( Verstraete et al., 2011 52. Verstraete, K. ∙ Vandriessche, G. ∙ Januar, M. ... Structural insights into the extracellular assembly of the hematopoietic Flt3 signaling complex Blood. 2011; 118 :60-68 Crossref Scopus (72) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 4 C).
The two domains of gO are held together through two disulfide bridges mediated by C167-C218 and C149-C141 ( Figure 4 D), which align in one plane across the gO subunit including the disulfide between C343(gO)-C144(gL). All cysteines in gO are conserved across all HCMV strains, suggesting that this organization could be important for the function of the HCMV Trimer and likely for receptor recognition ( Figure S3 B). A comprehensive bioinformatic sequence analysis of the primary sequence of HCMV subunits indicated that gO is one of the least conserved envelope glycoproteins with an identity of 81% ( Foglierini et al., 2019 13. Foglierini, M. ∙ Marcandalli, J. ∙ Perez, L. HCMV envelope glycoprotein diversity demystified Front. Microbiol. 2019; 10 :1005 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ). Notably, mapping of the gO conservation onto our structure indicates that, while the overall conservation of gO is lower than other HCMV proteins, there are in fact large surface patches on both domains of gO that are highly conserved ( Figure 4 E). Electrostatic surface analyses of gO identified a large area, comprising both N- and C-terminal domains, which is enriched in positive charges ( Figure 4 F). This area overlaps with the conserved gO surface ( Figures 4 E and 4F). Remarkably, the glycosylation sites on the gO subunit are unevenly distributed and clustered exclusively on one surface of the trimer, leaving one face of gO completely unmodified ( Figure 4 G). We predicted that this conserved, charged, and glycosylation-free surface of gO would be the primary region involved in receptor binding.
PDGFRα has recently been identified as a receptor for the HCMV Trimer that is required for viral entry into fibroblasts ( Kabanova et al., 2016 22. Kabanova, A. ∙ Marcandalli, J. ∙ Zhou, T. ...

USA. 2018; 115 :E9889-E9898 Crossref Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ), but the structural basis for PDGFRα recognition has remained unknown. Notably, the HCMV Trimer binds with high affinity and high selectivity to PDGFRα, but it does not bind to the closely related PDGFRβ or other members of class III RTKs or the related VEGF receptors (FLT1, KDR, and FLT4) ( Martinez-Martin et al., 2018 31.

Members of the class III receptor tyrosine kinase (RTKs) include PDGFRα, PDGFRβ, KIT, FMS, and FLT3 ( Lemmon and Schlessinger, 2010 26. Lemmon, M.A. ∙ Schlessinger, J. Cell signaling by receptor tyrosine kinases Cell. 2010; 141 :1117-1134 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (3590) PubMed Google Scholar ), where the architecture of these receptors consists of five extracellular immunoglobulin (Ig)-domain segments (D1–D5 domains), a short single span transmembrane domain, and an intracellular kinase domain ( Figure 5 B). We reconstituted HCMV Trimer in complex with Fabs 13H11/MSL-109 and the PDGFRα D1–D5 extracellular region and used cryo-EM to determine its structure ( Figure S4 A) to an overall resolution of ∼2.8 Å ( Figures 5 C, 5D, and S4 A–S4G). The high-resolution of our cryo-EM map allowed us to build the majority of the HCMV Trimer-13H11-MSL-109 complex and the amino acid sequence of the PDGFRα D1–D3 domains ( Figures 5 C, 5D S4 E, and S4F). Density for the PDGFRα D4 and D5 domain was very weak, presumably due to the absence of direct contacts to the HCMV Trimer. We wondered if the PDGFRα receptor interaction may propagate a conformational change onto the trimer to enable or disable binding of other HCMV glycoproteins, such as prefusion gB. However, we observed almost identical conformations of Trimer when comparing structures before or after PDGFRα binding ( Figure S5 D), suggesting a different mechanism is likely responsible for the activation of the HCMV fusion machinery.
When bound to Trimer, PDGFRα D1–D3 adopted a kinked conformation similar to previously determined structures of PDGFRβ and other D1–D3 domains of class III RTKs ( Figure S5 A). Structural comparisons of the individual D1–D3 domains between PDGFRα and PDGFRβ (determined in complex with PDGF) confirm the high similarity between both receptors (RMSDs between 0.8–1.0 Å) ( Figure S5 B). However, a comparison of the PDGFRα and PDGFRβ D1–D3 domains aligned along the D2 domain, shows an ∼105° relative rotation of D3 domain between the two structures, whereas the position of D1 is largely unchanged ( Figure S5 C).
PDGFRα D1–D3 domains establish extensive interactions at four major conserved surfaces across gO and the N terminus of gH ( Figures 5 D–5F, sites 1–4). Specifically, the first major interaction surface (site 1) involves the N terminus of gH and loop regions of PDGFRα D1 between strands D1-b and D1-c and between strands D1-d and D1-e ( Figures 5 D and S5 E). At site 1, PDGFRα E52 forms a salt-bridge with gH R47 and PDGFRα L80 contacts residues gH Y84 ( Figures 5 D and S5 E). Site 2 has an electrostatic nature with two acidic side chains in an extended loop between PDGFRα D1-f and D1-g (E108 and E109) that binds to the basic groove between the N- and C-terminal domains of gO ( Figures 5 D and S5 E). At site 3, hydrophobic residues at the PDGFRα D2 domain (M133, L137, L139, L208, and Y206) orient toward a hydrophobic groove at the N-terminal region of gO ( Figure 5 D). Site 4 involves E263 and K265 on strand d at the PDGFRα D3 domain to establish charged and polar interactions with R336, Y337, and N358 on gO ( Figure 5 D, site 4). Notably, subtle but distinctive side-chain differences at each of these four major interaction sites may collectively rationalize the high specificity of the trimer to bind to PDGFRα but not to PDGFRβ ( Figure S5 E). PDGFRα binds with nanomolar affinity to the trimer ( Figures 5 G–5I), consistent with the four large contact sites observed in the structure. Interestingly, the introduction of conservative-point mutations aiming to add a bulky N-linked glycan to each individual site in PDGFRα did not significantly reduce the binding to the trimer ( Figures 5 G–5I). However, a combination of the described mutations or the introduction of charge mutations at all four sites almost completely abolished the interaction between PDGFRα and the trimer ( Figure 5 H). Thus, the extensive interaction interface between the trimer and PDGFRα consists of numerous, highly conserved residues that facilitate a high affinity and highly selective binding of the trimer to the surface of the fibroblasts through engagement of PDGFRα.
Trimer is required for HCMV tropism into all cell types, including endothelial and epithelial cells ( Ryckman et al., 2008 41. Ryckman, B.J. ∙ Rainish, B.L. ∙ Chase, M.C. ...

Virol. 2015; 89 :8999-9009 Crossref Scopus (135) PubMed Google Scholar ). This requirement suggests that the trimer may directly contribute to HCMV host-cell tropism by directly interacting with multiple receptors. Accordingly, we recently identified TGFβR3 as a high affinity binder to the trimer and a putative HCMV receptor ( Martinez-Martin et al., 2018 31. Martinez-Martin, N. ∙ Marcandalli, J. ∙ Huang, C.S. ... An Unbiased Screen for Human Cytomegalovirus Identifies Neuropilin-2 as a Central Viral Receptor Cell. 2018; 174 :1158-1171.e19 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (150) PubMed Google Scholar ). The TGFβR3 glycoprotein is a member of the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling pathway receptor superfamily, which has essential roles in mediating cell proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, and cellular migration in most human tissues ( Zhang et al., 2017 58. Zhang, Y. ∙ Alexander, P.B. ∙ Wang, X.F. TGF-β family signaling in the control of cell proliferation and survival Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2017; 9 :a022145 Crossref Scopus (425) PubMed Google Scholar ). Despite the homology between TGFβR3 and TGFβR1, TGFβR2 or endoglin, we observed no binding between these additional proteins and HCMV Trimer ( Figure 6 A) ( Martinez-Martin et al., 2018 31. Martinez-Martin, N. ∙ Marcandalli, J. ∙ Huang, C.S. ... An Unbiased Screen for Human Cytomegalovirus Identifies Neuropilin-2 as a Central Viral Receptor Cell. 2018; 174 :1158-1171.e19 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (150) PubMed Google Scholar ). The extracellular domain of TGFβR3 is composed of two N-terminal membrane-distal orphan domain (OD2 and OD1) and the membrane-proximal zona pellucida (ZP) domain ( Kim et al., 2019 23. Kim, S.K. ∙ Whitley, M.J. ∙ Krzysiak, T.C. ... Structural Adaptation in Its Orphan Domain Engenders Betaglycan with an Alternate Mode of Growth Factor Binding Relative to Endoglin Structure. 2019; 27 :1427-1442.e4 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (10) PubMed Google Scholar ). Each OD is comprised of two β sandwich domains, whereas the ZP domain adopts a classical immunoglobulin-like fold ( Figure 6 B, ( Lin et al., 2011 27. Lin, S.J. ∙ Hu, Y.X. ∙ Zhu, J. ... Structure of betaglycan zona pellucida (ZP)-C domain provides insights into ZP-mediated protein polymerization and TGF-β binding Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108 :5232-5236 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar )).
To gain direct structural insights into TGFβR3 recognition by Trimer, we reconstituted a stoichiometric complex of TGFβR3 containing the OD and ZP domains with the HCMV Trimer and the Fabs 13H11 and MSL-109 and used cryo-EM to determine the structure to an overall resolution of ∼2.6 Å ( Figures 6 C–6G and S6 A–S6F). Because the trimer associated with the Ig-like D1–D3 domains of PDGFRα, we anticipated that the binding of TGFβR3 would occur through its Ig-like domains. Unexpectedly, our structure reveals that TGFβR3 exclusively utilizes the OD2 domain to bind to conserved residues on gO and gL at three major sites ( Figures 6 D–6J), whereas the density for the TGFβR3 OD1 domain appeared weak, due to the absence of direct contacts to the trimer. Notably, binding of TGFβR3 does not induce any major structural rearrangement on the trimer ( Figure S6 G), similarly to what we observed for PDGFRα.
Human TGFβR3 OD2 domain is comprised of 10 β strands and two α helices, one between β6 and β7 (α1), and the other one between β7 and β8 (α2) ( Figure S6 H) and the regions surrounding both helices make key contacts with the HCMV Trimer. Specifically, TGFβR3 utilizes a looped structure surrounding the α1 region to hydrogen bond with the S143 carbonyl and Q136 side chain to the gO side chains K118 and R117, respectively, at the N-terminal domain of gO (site 1) ( Figures 6 H and S6 H). Hydrophobic contacts between TGFβR3 F137 and gO L116 further support the interaction at site 1 ( Figure 6 H). At site 2, TGFβR3 R151 at strand β7 forms a pi-stacking interaction with gO Y188 and hydrogen bonds to gL N97 ( Figure 6 J). At site 3, TGFβR3 W163 at α2 and the carbonyl of K166 hydrogen bond with the gL side chains E94 and T92, respectively ( Figure 6 I).
The OD2 domains of TGFβR3 and endoglin are highly similar in structure ( Figure 6 K). A detailed view, especially at the key interaction areas of sites 1 and 2, reveals that the endoglin OD2 domain lacks the looped structure at α1 and does not adopt an extended beta-strand secondary structure at β7 ( Figures 6 K and S6 H). Overall, the multitude of interacting residues with contrasting properties rationalizes the strong interaction between TGFβR3 and the HCMV Trimer, and the key differences to endoglin at site 1 and site 2 provides an explanation for the high specificity and selectivity of the TGFβR3-Trimer interaction.
The HCMV Trimer is able to bind with high affinity to two completely different domain architectures present on divergent receptors: the Ig-like D1-D3 domains of PDGFRα and the OD2 domain of TGFβR3 ( Figures 5 and 6 ). Although both receptors interact at the membrane distal region of the trimer, PDGFRα and TGFβR3 bind to the trimer across different interaction surfaces ( Figures 5 E and 6 E). Despite this, superposition of the Trimer-PDGFRα and Trimer-TGFβR3 complex structures suggested that these receptors share a partially overlapping binding site at the interface between gH, gL, and gO and therefore cannot bind the trimer at the same time ( Figure 7 A). Moreover, an N-linked glycan chain on PDGFRα N179 points into the direction of the TGFβR3 binding site, which might further limit simultaneous receptor binding ( Figure 7 A).
To test the hypothesis that PDGFRα and TGFβR3 binding to the trimer are mutually exclusive, we performed competition experiments by incubating HCMV Trimer bound to TGFβR3 with equimolar amounts of PDGFRα ( Figures 7 B and S7 ). Our results indicate that PDGFRα can completely substitute for bound TGFβR3 ( Figure 7 B), consistent with the reported higher affinity between HCMV Trimer and PDGFRα as compared to TGFβR3 ( Martinez-Martin et al., 2018 31. Martinez-Martin, N. ∙ Marcandalli, J. ∙ Huang, C.S. ... An Unbiased Screen for Human Cytomegalovirus Identifies Neuropilin-2 as a Central Viral Receptor Cell. 2018; 174 :1158-1171.e19 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (150) PubMed Google Scholar ). Taken together, our structural and biophysical data suggest that PDGFRα and TGFβR3 do not function as co-receptors, but rather mediate HCMV tropism by acting as independent receptors.
The presented cryo-EM structures of the trimer, Trimer-PDGFRα, and Trimer-TGFβR3 reveal the functionally important and highly conserved surfaces on the trimer involved in receptor binding which are likely the target of potent neutralizing antibodies ( Figures 4 and 5 and 6 ). Thus, we wondered whether the trimer interactions with PDGFRα might interfere with key cellular signaling pathways. For PDGFRα, binding of the PDGF growth factors dimerizes the receptor and activates the intracellular kinase domain to induce the signaling cascade ( Shim et al., 2010 45. Shim, A.H.R. ∙ Liu, H. ∙ Focia, P.J. ... Structures of a platelet-derived growth factor/propeptide complex and a platelet-derived growth factor/receptor complex Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107 :11307-11312 Crossref Scopus (153) PubMed Google Scholar ). A structural superposition of the Trimer-PDGFRα complex with a homology model of the dimeric (signaling active) PDGFRα-PDGF complex shows multiple steric clashes of gO and PDGF at the PDGFRα D2 and D3 interaction interfaces ( Figures 7 C and S5 E). Given the strong interaction of the trimer and PDGFRα at nanomolar affinities ( Kabanova et al., 2016 22. Kabanova, A. ∙ Marcandalli, J. ∙ Zhou, T. ... Platelet-derived growth factor-α receptor is the cellular receptor for human cytomegalovirus gHgLgO trimer Nat. Microbiol. 2016; 1 :16082 Crossref Scopus (141) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 5 G) and the moderate binding affinity of PDGF-AA to PDGFRα characterized by three digit nanomolar affinities ( Mamer et al., 2017 30. Mamer, S.B. ∙ Chen, S. ∙ Weddell, J.C. ... Discovery of High-Affinity PDGF-VEGFR Interactions: Redefining RTK Dynamics Sci. Rep. 2017; 7 :16439 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ), we hypothesized that the trimer can compete with PDGF for binding to PDGFRα and thereby prevent the induction of the signaling cascade. To test this hypothesis, we first purified the HCMV Trimer with charge mutations at gO (Trimer mut ; sites 2–4: M84R, F111R, R117E, F136R, R212E, R230E, R234E, R336E, F342E, A351R, and N358R) and observed an ∼10,000 times reduced in vitro binding to PDGFRα (KD T rimer-WT : 2.25 × 10 −9 ± 1.1 M versus KDT rimer-mut : 4.25 × 10 −5 ± 0.5 M) ( Figure 7 D). We next assessed PDGFRα activation and signaling in MRC-5 fibroblast cells on addition of PDGF-AA and Trimer WT or Trimer mut by detecting the auto-phosphorylated PDGFRα residues Y762 and Y849 as well as phosphorylated AKT as downstream substrate. Although PDGF-AA alone induced strong activation signals at PDGFRα and AKT, titration of Trimer WT strongly reduced the PDGF-AA induced activity of PDGFRα ( Figure 7 E). On the contrary, addition of the PDGFRα binding-deficient Trimer mut did not reduce the activity of PDGFRα in presence of PDGF-AA ( Figure 7 E). Thus, HCMV Trimer competes directly with PDGF-AA for the binding to PDGFRα and can interfere with PDGFRα signaling, which is an important consideration for the design of an effective and safe trimer-based antiviral strategy.

Section: Discussion

In this work, we present structures of the HCMV Trimer that have revealed unprecedented insights into the architecture of the trimer complex, binding of broadly neutralizing antibodies, the mechanism of trimer-mediated HCMV receptor interaction, and the consequences on cellular signaling pathways. These results have important consequences for the design of trimer-based anti-viral therapeutics.
In the trimer, the three subunits gH, gL, and gO, interact in a linear orientation to assemble a boot-like structure ( Figures 1 A and 1B) consistent with previous low-resolution observations ( Ciferri et al., 2015a 8. Ciferri, C. ∙ Chandramouli, S. ∙ Donnarumma, D. ... Structural and biochemical studies of HCMV gH/gL/gO and Pentamer reveal mutually exclusive cell entry complexes Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112 :1767-1772 Crossref Scopus (122) PubMed Google Scholar ). The overall trimer architecture is similar in shape and length to the pentamer, in part, because the conformation of the shared subunits gH and gL are nearly identical ( Figures 2 A and S2 A) ( Chandramouli et al., 2017 4. Chandramouli, S. ∙ Malito, E. ∙ Nguyen, T. ... Structural basis for potent antibody-mediated neutralization of human cytomegalovirus Sci. Immunol. 2017; 2 :eaan1457 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ). Two previously determined pentamer crystal structures depicted distinct conformations with a bend originating at a linker helix between gH D1 and D2 ( Chandramouli et al., 2017 4. Chandramouli, S. ∙ Malito, E. ∙ Nguyen, T. ... Structural basis for potent antibody-mediated neutralization of human cytomegalovirus Sci. Immunol. 2017; 2 :eaan1457 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ), but we did not observe distinct conformations within the cryo-EM trimer structures ( Figure S1 ). Instead, we observed a small degree of flexibility throughout the trimer and applied focused refinements to improve the map quality ( Figure S1 ). The domain organization of gH/gL observed in both HCMV Trimer and Pentamer places it in-between the gH/gL conformations described for EBV and HSV, respectively ( Chandramouli et al., 2017 4. Chandramouli, S. ∙ Malito, E. ∙ Nguyen, T. ... Structural basis for potent antibody-mediated neutralization of human cytomegalovirus Sci.

USA. 2010; 107 :22641-22646 Crossref Scopus (143) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Direct comparison between the membrane distal regions of the Trimer and Pentamer structures reveals a structural rearrangement of the gL C144 and surrounding amino acids to facilitate the stable interaction with the trimer-specific subunit gO or the pentamer-specific subunit UL128, respectively ( Figures 2 C–2F). The conformational change and local refolding of gL that we observed finally provides the structural context for allowing the previously described alternative disulfide bond formation of gL C144 with gO C343 or UL128 C162 ( Ciferri et al., 2015a 8.

USA. 2015; 112 :1767-1772 Crossref Scopus (122) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Broadly neutralizing antibodies 13H11 and MSL-109 bind at two opposite sides of gH ( Figures 1 A and 3 ), consistent with previous low resolution studies ( Ciferri et al., 2015a 8. Ciferri, C. ∙ Chandramouli, S. ∙ Donnarumma, D. ... Structural and biochemical studies of HCMV gH/gL/gO and Pentamer reveal mutually exclusive cell entry complexes Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Both Fabs make extensive contacts to gH, but the high structural similarity to the pentamer structure which was determined in the absence of gH-binding Fabs suggests that the binding of 13H11 and MSL-109 does not significantly alter the conformation of gH ( Figure S2 ). In addition, binding of both Fabs to the trimer does not prevent the interactions with PDGFRα or TGFβR3 ( Figures 5 and 6 ) ( Kabanova et al., 2016 22. Kabanova, A. ∙ Marcandalli, J. ∙ Zhou, T. ... Platelet-derived growth factor-α receptor is the cellular receptor for human cytomegalovirus gHgLgO trimer Nat. Microbiol. 2016; 1 :16082 Crossref Scopus (141) PubMed Google Scholar ), which raises the question of how binding of 13H11 and MSL-109 antibodies mediates HCMV neutralization. In situ cryogenic electron tomography (cryo-ET) studies of glycoprotein interactions on the surface of HCMV suggested an interaction of gB in its pre-fusion conformation with gH ( Si et al., 2018 46. Si, Z. ∙ Zhang, J. ∙ Shivakoti, S. ... Different functional states of fusion protein gB revealed on human cytomegalovirus by cryo electron tomography with Volta phase plate PLoS Pathog. 2018; 14 :e1007452 Crossref Scopus (65) PubMed Google Scholar ) that appears to occur at the membrane proximal side of gH and results in a kinked orientation of gHgL complexes relative to the virion surface ( Si et al., 2018 46. Si, Z. ∙ Zhang, J. ∙ Shivakoti, S. ... Different functional states of fusion protein gB revealed on human cytomegalovirus by cryo electron tomography with Volta phase plate PLoS Pathog. 2018; 14 :e1007452 Crossref Scopus (65) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 7 F). Based on this model, 13H11 and MSL-109 binding to gH might neutralize HCMV entry by either directly competing for gB binding or indirectly by disrupting the kinked orientation of the gHgL complex relative to the virion surface ( Figure 7 F). Future studies are required to address the structural basis of the gB-gH interaction at high-resolution and the physiological consequences in the context of the trimer and pentamer mediated HCMV entry.
The receptor proteins PDGFRα and TGFβR3 bind to the trimer across a conserved, glycosylation-free surface comprising a large portion of the trimer-specific subunit gO, but also extending into gL and the N-terminal region of gH ( Figures 5 and 6 ). The mode of Trimer-PDGFRα interaction is consistent with prior low-resolution studies ( Kabanova et al., 2016 22. Kabanova, A. ∙ Marcandalli, J. ∙ Zhou, T. ... Platelet-derived growth factor-α receptor is the cellular receptor for human cytomegalovirus gHgLgO trimer Nat. Microbiol. 2016; 1 :16082 Crossref Scopus (141) PubMed Google Scholar ), alanine scanning mutations of gO ( Stegmann et al., 2019 51. Stegmann, C. ∙ Rothemund, F. ∙ Laib Sampaio, K. ... The N Terminus of Human Cytomegalovirus Glycoprotein O Is Important for Binding to the Cellular Receptor PDGFRα J. Virol. 2019; 93 e00138-19 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ), and competition experiments with PDGFRα-derived peptides ( Stegmann et al., 2016 49. Stegmann, C. ∙ Abdellatif, M.E.A. ∙ Laib Sampaio, K. ... Importance of Highly Conserved Peptide Sites of Human Cytomegalovirus gO for Formation of the gH/gL/gO Complex J. Virol. 2016; 91 :e01339-16 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ). We therefore speculate that glycosylation-free areas may similarly be used by the HCMV Pentamer to bind to the NRP2 receptor ( Figure S2 C) ( Martinez-Martin et al., 2018 31. Martinez-Martin, N. ∙ Marcandalli, J. ∙ Huang, C.S. ... An Unbiased Screen for Human Cytomegalovirus Identifies Neuropilin-2 as a Central Viral Receptor Cell. 2018; 174 :1158-1171.e19 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (150) PubMed Google Scholar ). Notably, it was previously proposed that Pentamer would undergo a large conformational change on NRP2 binding to trigger gB mediated membrane fusion and HCMV entry ( Chandramouli et al., 2017 4. Chandramouli, S. ∙ Malito, E. ∙ Nguyen, T. ... Structural basis for potent antibody-mediated neutralization of human cytomegalovirus Sci. Immunol. 2017; 2 :eaan1457 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ); but this mechanism was proposed in the absence of a high-resolution structure of the HCMV Pentamer bound to NRP2. Although we cannot exclude that the presence of gHgL specific neutralizing antibodies in our complexes might stabilize the trimer in a specific locked conformation, our work suggests that the interaction with PDGFRα or TGFβR3 does not significantly alter the conformation of the trimer ( Figures S5 D and S6 G). The lack of large structural rearrangements within the trimer on receptor binding suggests a mechanism for trimer-specific HCMV entry into host-cells. We propose that receptor binding may function as a high-affinity tether of the virus to the host cell membrane rather than induce HCMV Trimer conformational changes. The trimer-receptor interactions may additionally act as a spacer to bring the viral and host cell membranes into an optimal distance range to efficiently trigger the transition of gB from its pre- to post-fusion conformation and to initiate membrane fusion. Based on recent cryo-ET studies of the HCMV surface, it is also conceivable that receptor binding would induce a rigid body motion of the trimer that would affect gB-gH binding and activate gB ( Si et al., 2018 46. Si, Z. ∙ Zhang, J. ∙ Shivakoti, S. ... Different functional states of fusion protein gB revealed on human cytomegalovirus by cryo electron tomography with Volta phase plate PLoS Pathog. 2018; 14 :e1007452 Crossref Scopus (65) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 7 F). Future high-resolution structural studies of the HCMV Pentamer bound to NRP2 will indicate if this model is generally applicable to both complexes during HCMV entry.
The mutually exclusive binding of PDGFRα and TGFβR3 to the trimer revealed by our structural and biophysical studies ( Figures 7 A and 7B) suggests a role of both receptor interactions for entry into different cell types. Although the Trimer-PDGFRα interaction has been studied extensively for its function to mediate entry of HCMV into fibroblasts ( Kabanova et al., 2016 22. Kabanova, A. ∙ Marcandalli, J. ∙ Zhou, T. ... Platelet-derived growth factor-α receptor is the cellular receptor for human cytomegalovirus gHgLgO trimer Nat.

Human cytomegalovirus glycoprotein complex gH/gL/gO uses PDGFR-α as a key for entry PLoS Pathog. 2017; 13 :e1006281 Crossref Scopus (117) PubMed Google Scholar ), the specific contribution of the Trimer-TGFβR3 interaction for HCMV entry is still largely unknown. Initial studies in HUVECs did not demonstrate a measurable effect for TGFβR3 in viral entry ( Martinez-Martin et al., 2018 31. Martinez-Martin, N. ∙ Marcandalli, J. ∙ Huang, C.S. ... An Unbiased Screen for Human Cytomegalovirus Identifies Neuropilin-2 as a Central Viral Receptor Cell. 2018; 174 :1158-1171.e19 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (150) PubMed Google Scholar ). Nevertheless, TGFβR3 is ubiquitously expressed and thus a plausible hypothesis is that this receptor facilitates entry into additional cell types during infection, including those where PDGFRα is expressed to very low levels or absent. In addition, given the proposed functions of TGFβR3 as a modulator of TGF signaling ( Chu et al., 2011 7. Chu, W. ∙ Li, X. ∙ Li, C. ...

Overall, our results indicate the possibility that PDGFRα and TGFβR3 may function as alternative, independent receptors, suggesting additional entry routes or regulatory roles for these interactions during viral infection.
The unique role of the trimer during HCMV infections into all cell types ( Liu et al., 2018 28. Liu, J. ∙ Jardetzky, T.S. ∙ Chin, A.L. ... The Human Cytomegalovirus Trimer and Pentamer Promote Sequential Steps in Entry into Epithelial and Endothelial Cells at Cell Surfaces and Endosomes J. Virol. 2018; 92 :e01336-18 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the recent discovery of potent antibodies specifically neutralizing the trimer ( Falk et al., 2018 12. Falk, J.J. ∙ Winkelmann, M. ∙ Stöhr, D. ... Identification of elite neutralizers with broad and potent neutralizing activity against human cytomegalovirus (hcmv) in a population of hcmv-seropositive blood donors J. Infect. Dis. 2018; 218 :876-885 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ) highlight its increasing importance as a main target for the development of HCMV vaccines or anti-viral therapeutics. Importantly, our studies directly establish the possibility that the glycan-free surface of gO may be targeted for the potential discovery and development of novel broadly neutralizing antibodies. Additionally, blocking the trimer interaction to PDGFRα and TGFβR3 would also provide a new strategy for targeting HCMV entry. Importantly, the trimer makes extensive contacts across multiple interaction sites with PDGFRα and TGFβR3 and our attempts to disrupt binding at single sites completely failed to abolish PDGFRα binding ( Figure 5 ). Instead, we show that multiple interaction sites in gO need to be targeted simultaneously to block the interaction of HCMV Trimer with PDGFRα ( Figure 5 H). Thus, it is conceivable that a broadly neutralizing antibody with a sufficiently large interaction footprint on gO may be able to displace the interaction of both PDGFRα and TGFβR3 receptor proteins. Alternatively, for the development of an anti-viral therapeutic, it is possible to conceive the utilization of the D1–D3 domains of PDGFRα to block trimer binding to endogenous host receptors. As a proof-of-concept, Park and colleagues recently designed a soluble PDGFRα protein carrying targeted mutations to block PDGF binding while retaining HCMV Trimer binding and neutralization ( Park et al., 2020 37. Park, J. ∙ Gill, K.S. ∙ Aghajani, A.A. ... Engineered receptors for human cytomegalovirus that are orthogonal to normal human biology PLoS Pathog. 2020; 16 :e1008647 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ). Additional trimer-based therapeutic strategies might include the design of a trimer protein covering multiple interaction sites to PDGFRα and TGFβR3; however, a purified trimer would compete with PDGF for the binding to PDGFRα and thereby interfere with endogenous receptor activation and signaling ( Figures 7 C and 7E). A solution to this problem might involve the de novo design of proteins or peptides to block PDGFRα binding to the trimer while not interfering with PDGFRα signaling.
In summary, we have presented the structure of HCMV Trimer and elucidated the structural basis for receptor recognition and antibody neutralization. Together, these findings will guide the development of a new generation of HCMV therapeutics aimed to block receptor binding and to elicit potent and clinically relevant protective neutralizing antibody responses.

The structures of HCMV Trimer apo and bound to PDGFRα and TGFβR3 are accessible.The accession number for the structures reported in this paper are PDB: 7LBE , 7LBF , 7LBG (atomic models) and EMDB: EMD-23252, EMD-23253 and EMD-23254 (maps).
The cell line Expi293F is a human embryonic kidney cell line (female) transformed and adopted to grow in suspension (Thermo Fisher) and was used for protein expression. Expi293F cells were cultured in SMM 293T-I medium at 37°C and 5% CO 2 . The cell line MRC-5 (male) is a human fetal lung fibroblast cell line and was used to study receptor phosphorylation and downstream signaling of PDGFRα. MRC-5 cells were cultured in RPMI media supplemented with 10% FBS, glutamine and antibiotics at 37°C and 5% CO 2 . E. coli 34B8 cells were used for fab expression and cultured in phosphate limiting media (C.R.A.P) for 20 h at 30°C. Expi293F cells were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific, authenticated and tested for Mycoplasma contamination. MRC-5 cells were authenticated by analysis of Short tandem repeat (STR) loci at ATCC.
Optimized coding DNAs for human PDGFRα (1-528) and TGFβR3 (1-787) and human herpesvirus 5, gH (1-716), gL and gO (HCMV strain Merlin for gH and gL and strain VR1814 for gO) were each cloned into a pRK vector behind a CMV promoter. A C-terminal FLAG-tag was added to TGFβR3, a C-terminal human IgG1 (Fc) tag was added to PDGFRα constructs, a C-terminal Myc-Avi-His tag was added to gH and a C-terminal Twin-Strep-tag was added to gO. Expi293F cells in suspension were cultured in SMM 293T-I medium under 5% CO 2 at 37°C and transfected using polyethylenimine (PEI) with DNAs at a 1:1:1 ratio for the gHgLgO expression when the cell density reached 4 × 10 6 cells per ml. Transfected cells were cultured for 7 days before harvesting of the expression supernatant.
The HCMV Trimer gHgLgO was purified in three-steps. The expression supernatant corresponding to a 35 l expression was concentrated via tangential flow filtration (TFF) to a volume of 1-2 l, loaded on a 20 mL Ni Sepharose Excel (cytiva) resin, washed with 13 column volumes (CV) wash buffer (30 mM TRIS pH 8.0, 250 mM NaCl, 5% Glycerol, 20 mM imidazole) and eluted in 5 CV elution buffer (30 mM TRIS pH 8.0, 250 mM NaCl, 5% Glycerol, 400 mM imidazole). The eluent was applied to 3 mL Strep-Tactin XT high affinity resin (IBA) and bound for 2h. The resin was washed with 10 CV Strep-wash buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 5% Glycerol) and eluted from the beads in Strep-wash buffer supplemented with 50 mM biotin. The eluate was concentrated with an Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter device (30 kDa MWCO) and loaded on a Superdex 200 10/300 or 10/60 column equilibrated in Trimer-SEC buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 5% Glycerol).
Human Fc-tagged PDGFRα proteins were expressed in 30 mL cultures of Expi293F cells, transfected with 30 μg of plasmid DNA, and grown for 7 days. After harvesting the expression media culture supernatants, the Fc-fusion proteins were purified with 0.15 mL Toyopearl AF-r Protein A HC-650F (Tosoh Bioscience, Grove City, OH). Unbound proteins and media components were removed by washing with 10 CV of Phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4). PDGFRα-huFc fusions were eluted from the resin using elution buffer (50 mM Phosphoric acid, pH 2.9) and immediately neutralized to a pH of ∼6.0 by adding 0.05 mL of 20X PBS pH 11.0. The proteins were further polished by Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC) purification, performed on a Zenix-C SEC 300 column (Sepax Technology, Newark, DE), connected to an UltiMate 3000 HPLC System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). The column was equilibrated in 1X PBS, pH 7.4 and the samples were separated by isocratic elution at a flowrate of 1.5 ml/min.
Human TGFβR3-Flag was purified from a 10 l expression supernatant. The supernatant was incubated with 10 mL M2 agarose Flag resin (Sigma) and incubated for 20 h at 4°C. The resin was washed with 10 CV FLAG-wash Buffer (30 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol) and eluted with FLAG-wash buffer supplemented with 0.2 mg/ml FLAG peptide. The eluate was concentrated with an Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter device (30 kDa MWCO) and loaded on a Superdex 200 10/60 column equilibrated in TGFβR3-SEC-1 buffer (30 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 5% Glycerol).
The heavy and light chain of fab MSL-109 were co-expressed under a phoA promoter in E. coli 34B8 cells (in-house strain) in phosphate limiting media (C.R.A.P) for 20 h at 30°C. The pellet from a 1 l expression was resuspended in 70 mL lysis buffer (1x PBS, 25 mM EDTA) supplemented with Roche protease inhibitor tablets and lysed by sonication. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 25.000xg for 1 h and subsequently passed through a 0.45 μm filter. The cleared lysate was loaded onto a 5 mL HiTrap Protein G HP (cytiva) column that was equilibrated in lysis buffer. The column was washed with 10-20 CV lysis buffer and eluted in 0.58% (v/v) acetic acid. The pH of the eluate was immediately adjusted by addition of SP-A buffer (20 mM MES pH 5.5) and loaded onto a 5 mL HiTrap SP HP cation exchange chromatography column (cytiva). The fab was eluted in a linear 20 CV gradient to SP-B buffer (20 mM MES pH 5.5, 500 mM NaCl). The eluate was concentrated using an Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter device (10 kDa MWCO) and further purified on a Superdex 200 10/300 column equilibrated in fab-S200 buffer (25 mM Tris pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl). The purified fab was concentrated an Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter device (10 kDa MWCO), frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −80°C. The heavy and light chain of fab 13H11 were co-expressed under a phoA promoter in E. coli 34B8 cells (in-house strain) in phosphate limiting media (C.R.A.P) for 20 h at 30°C. The pellet from a 4 l expression was resuspended in 250 mL lysis buffer (25mM Tris pH7.5, 150mM NaCl, 5mM EDTA, 2mM NaN 3 ) supplemented with Roche protease inhibitor tablets and lysed by sonication. Subsequent purification followed similar protocol as described for MSL-109.
PDGFRα (1-524) with five amino acids (DDDDK) at the C terminus (Sino Biological) was used for cryo-EM sample preparation and the in vitro competition experiments. The lyophilized powder was resuspended in ddH2O, concentrated in an Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter device (30 kDa MWCO) and purified on a Superose 6 3.2/300 column equilibrated in PDGFRα-SEC buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 250 mM NaCl) prior reconstitution with the HCMV Trimer gHgLgO and the neutralizing fabs.
TGFβR3 (1-781) with a C-terminal His-tag (Sino Biological) was used for cryo-EM sample preparation. The lyophilized powder was resuspended in ddH2O, concentrated in an Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter device (30 kDa MWCO) and purified on a Superdex 200 3.2/300 Increase column equilibrated in TGFβR-SEC-2 buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl) prior assembling with the HCMV Trimer gHgLgO and the neutralizing fabs.
The gHgLgO-13H11-MSL-109 complex was assembled by incubation of 18.3 μM gHgLgO (300 μg) with an excess of the fabs 13H11 at 30 μM (150 μg) and MSL-109 at 30 μM (150 μg) for 30 min on ice. The excess of the fabs was removed by purification on a Superose 6 3.2/300 column equilibrated in SEC-reconst-1 buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl). The main peak fraction of gHgLgO-13H11-MSL-109 was diluted with SEC-reconst-1 buffer to a concentration of 0.4 mg/ml for cryo-EM sample preparation.
The PDGFRα-gHgLgO-13H11-MSL-109 complex was assembled by incubation of 5 μM (83.3 μg) gHgLgO with an excess of PDGFRα at 6 μM (33.3 μg) and the fabs 13H11 and MSL-109 at each 18 μM (50 μg) for at least 30 min on ice. The excess of the fabs was removed by purification on a Superose 6 3.2/300 column equilibrated in SEC-reconst-2 buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl). The main peak fractions of gHgLgO-13H11-MSL-109 were combined and concentrated to 0.5 mg/ml for cryo-EM sample preparation.
The TGFβR3-gHgLgO-13H11-MSL-109 complex was assembled by incubation of 7.6 μM (85.5 μg) gHgLgO with an excess of TGFβR3 at 9.2 μM (54 μg) of the fabs 13H11 at 22.6 μM (78 μg) and MSL-109 at 61 μM (210 μg) for at least 30 min on ice. The excess of the fabs was removed by purification on a Superose 6 3.2/300 column equilibrated in SEC-reconst-2 buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl). The main peak fractions of gHgLgO-13H11-MSL-109 were combined and concentrated to 0.5 mg/ml for cryo-EM sample preparation.
The gHgLgO-13H11-MSL-109 complex and the PDGFRα-gHgLgO-13H11-MSL-109 complex were prepared in the following manner. Holey carbon grids (C-Flat 45 nm R 1.2/1.3 300 mesh coated with Au/Pd 80/20; Protochips) were glow-discharged for 10 s using the Solarus plasma cleaner (Gatan). The complex was gently cross-linked with 0.025% EM-grade glutaraldehyde for 10 min at room temperature and quenched with 9 mM Tris pH 7.5. 3 μl of the sample (now at about 0.4 mg/ml) was applied to the grid. Grids were blotted with a Vitrobot Mark IV (Thermofisher) using 2.5 s blotting time with 100% humidity and plunge-frozen in liquid ethane cooled by liquid nitrogen.
The TGFβR3-gHgLgO-13H11-MSL-109 complex was prepared in the following manner. Holey carbon grids (Ultrafoil 25 nM Au R 1.2/1.3 300 mesh; Quantifoil) were glow-discharged for 10 s using the Solarus plasma cleaner (Gatan). 3 μl of the sample was applied to the grid and blotted single-sided with a Leica EM GP (Leica) using 3.5 s blotting time with 100% humidity and plunge-frozen in liquid ethane cooled by liquid nitrogen.
Movie stacks were collected using SerialEM ( Mastronarde, 2005 32. Mastronarde, D.N. Automated electron microscope tomography using robust prediction of specimen movements J. Struct. Biol. 2005; 152 :36-51 Crossref Scopus (3217) PubMed Google Scholar ) on a Titan Krios operated at 300 keV with bioquantum energy filter equipped with a K2 Summit direct electron detector camera (Gatan). Images were recorded at 165,000 × magnification corresponding to 0.824 Å per pixel, using a 20 eV energy slit. Each image stack contains 50 frames recorded every 0.2 s for an accumulated dose of ∼50 e Å −2 and a total exposure time of 10 s. Images were recorded with a set defocus range of 0.5 to 1.5 μm.
Cryo-EM data were processed using a combination of the RELION ( Scheres, 2012 43. Scheres, S.H.W. RELION: implementation of a Bayesian approach to cryo-EM structure determination J. Struct. Biol. 2012; 180 :519-530 Crossref Scopus (3642) PubMed Google Scholar ) and cisTEM ( Grant et al., 2018 17. Grant, T. ∙ Rohou, A. ∙ Grigorieff, N. cis TEM, user-friendly software for single-particle image processing eLife. 2018; 7 :e35383 Crossref Scopus (568) PubMed Google Scholar ) software packages.
For the gHgLgO-13H11-MSL-109 complex, a total of 14,717 movies were corrected for frame motion using the MotionCor2 ( Zheng et al., 2017 59. Zheng, S.Q. ∙ Palovcak, E. ∙ Armache, J.P. ... MotionCor2: Anisotropic correction of beam-induced motion for improved cryo-electron microscopy Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :331-332 Crossref Scopus (4513) PubMed Google Scholar ) implementation in RELION and contrast-transfer function parameters were fit using the 30-4.5 Å band of the spectrum with CTFFIND-4 ( Rohou and Grigorieff, 2015 39. Rohou, A. ∙ Grigorieff, N. CTFFIND4: Fast and accurate defocus estimation from electron micrographs J. Struct. Biol. 2015; 192 :216-221 Crossref Scopus (2863) PubMed Google Scholar ). For the generation of the first ab-inito 3D reconstruction, images were filtered on the basis of the detected fit resolution better than 4 Å. A total of 974,766 particles were picked using the circular blob picking tool within cisTEM. Particle were sorted in 2 rounds of cisTEM 2D classification to select the best aligning particles yielding 313,196 particles. These particles were subjected to an ab-initio generation within cisTEM with three target volumes. The volume corresponding to a single HCMV Trimer was used as a reference for cisTEM auto-refine and manual refinement with a mask around a single (monomeric) gHgLgO-13H11-MSL-109 complex and by applying low-pass filter (LPF) outside the mask. This map was used as a 3D reference for the high-resolution 3D refinements.
For the generation of a high-resolution 3D reconstruction of the gHgLgO-13H11-MSL-109 complex, CTF fitted images were filtered on the basis of the detected fit resolution better than 6 Å. A total of 1,478,640 particles were picked by template-matching with gautomatch ( https://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/research/locally-developed-software/zhang-software/#gauto ) using a 30 Å low-pass filtered gHgLgO-13H11-MSL-109 complex reference structure. Particles were sorted during RELION 2D classification and 1,350,211 selected particles were imported into cisTEM for 3D refinements. The gHgLgO-13H11-MSL-109 3D reconstruction was obtained after auto-refine and manual refinements with a mask around a single (monomeric) gHgLgO-13H11-MSL-109 complex and by applying low-pass filter outside the mask (filter resolution 20 Å) and a score threshold of 0.25, so that only the best-scoring 25% of particle images would be included in the 3D reconstruction at each cycle. The weight outside of the mask was incrementally reduced from 0.5 to 0.15 in iterative rounds of manual refinements. The 3D refinement, which at no point used any data at frequencies higher than 3.6 Å, converged to a map resolution of 2.9 Å (Fourier shell correlation (FSC) = 0.143, determined in cisTEM). To improve the quality of the map, focused refinements were conducted after dividing the map into three distinct regions using masks and applying low-pass filter outside the mask (filter resolution 20 Å) and a score threshold of 0.25. The focused maps were sharpened in cisTEM with the following parameters: flattening from a resolution of 8 Å, applying a pre-cut-off B-factor of −90 Å 2 from the origin of reciprocal space and applying a figure-of-merit filter ( Rosenthal and Henderson, 2003 40. Rosenthal, P.B. ∙ Henderson, R. Optimal determination of particle orientation, absolute hand, and contrast loss in single-particle electron cryomicroscopy J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 333 :721-745 Crossref Scopus (1610) PubMed Google Scholar ). For model building and figure preparation, a composite map was generated from the three individual focused 3D maps using phenix combine_focused_maps ( Afonine et al., 2018 1. Afonine, P.V. ∙ Poon, B.K. ∙ Read, R.J. ... Real-space refinement in PHENIX for cryo-EM and crystallography Acta Crystallogr. D. Struct.

The PDGFRα-gHgLgO-13H11-MSL-109 complex was processed similarly as for the gHgLgO-13H11-MSL-109 complex. A total of 34,829 movies were collected from two grids, corrected for frame motion using the MotionCor2 ( Zheng et al., 2017 59. Zheng, S.Q. ∙ Palovcak, E. ∙ Armache, J.P. ... MotionCor2: Anisotropic correction of beam-induced motion for improved cryo-electron microscopy Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :331-332 Crossref Scopus (4513) PubMed Google Scholar ) Implementation in RELION and contrast-transfer function parameters were fit using the 30-4.5 Å band of the spectrum with CTFFIND-4 ( Rohou and Grigorieff, 2015 39. Rohou, A. ∙ Grigorieff, N. CTFFIND4: Fast and accurate defocus estimation from electron micrographs J. Struct. Biol. 2015; 192 :216-221 Crossref Scopus (2863) PubMed Google Scholar ). CTF fitted images were selected on the basis of a detected fit resolution better than 8 Å. A total of 4,151,085 particles were picked by template-matching with gautomatch using a 30 Å low-pass filtered gHgLgO-13H11-MSL-109 complex reference structure. Particles were sorted during RELION 2D classification and 3,560,620 selected particles were imported into cisTEM for 3D refinements. The PDGFRα-gHgLgO-13H11-MSL-109 3D reconstruction was obtained after auto-refine and manual refinements with a mask, by applying low-pass filter outside the mask (filter resolution 20 Å) and a score threshold of 0.25. The outside weight was thereby incrementally reduced from 0.5 to 0.15 in iterative rounds of manual refinements. The 3D reconstructions converged to a map resolution of 2.8 Å (FSC = 0.143, determined in cisTEM; no data beyond 3.4 Å were used during refinement). To improve the quality of the map, focused refinements were obtained after dividing the map into three distinct regions using masks and of the manual refinements low-pass filter outside the mask (filter resolution 20 Å) and a score threshold of 0.25. The focused maps were sharpened in cisTEM and combined using phenix with the following parameters: flattening from a resolution of 8 Å, applying a pre-cut-off B-factor of −90 Å 2 from the origin of reciprocal space and applying a figure-of-merit filter ( Rosenthal and Henderson, 2003 40.

The TGFβR3-gHgLgO-13H11-MSL-109 complex was processed similarly as for the gHgLgO-13H11-MSL-109 complex. A total of 19,993 movies were corrected for frame motion using the MotionCor2 ( Zheng et al., 2017 59. Zheng, S.Q. ∙ Palovcak, E. ∙ Armache, J.P. ... MotionCor2: Anisotropic correction of beam-induced motion for improved cryo-electron microscopy Nat.

Rohou, A. ∙ Grigorieff, N. CTFFIND4: Fast and accurate defocus estimation from electron micrographs J. Struct. Biol. 2015; 192 :216-221 Crossref Scopus (2863) PubMed Google Scholar ). A total of 2,780,519 particles were picked by template-matching with gautomatch using a 30 Å low-pass filtered gHgLgO-13H11-MSL-109 complex reference structure. Particles were sorted during RELION 2D classification and 2,780,519 selected particles were imported into cisTEM for 3D refinements. The TGFβR3-gHgLgO-13H11-MSL-109 3D reconstruction was obtained after auto-refine and manual refinements with a mask and by applying low-pass filter (LPF) outside the mask (filter resolution 20 Å) and a score threshold of 0.25. The outside weight was thereby incrementally reduced from 0.5 to 0.15 in iterative rounds of manual refinements. The 3D reconstructions converged to a map resolution of 2.6 Å (FSC = 0.143, determined in cisTEM; no data beyond 3.1 Å were used during refinement).

Biol. 2003; 333 :721-745 Crossref Scopus (1610) PubMed Google Scholar ). Local resolution was determined in cisTEM using a re-implementation of the blocres algorithm ( Cardone et al., 2013 3. Cardone, G. ∙ Heymann, J.B. ∙ Steven, A.C. One number does not fit all: mapping local variations in resolution in cryo-EM reconstructions J. Struct.

The gH and gL subunits of the HCMV pentamer structure ( Chandramouli et al., 2017 4. Chandramouli, S. ∙ Malito, E. ∙ Nguyen, T. ... Structural basis for potent antibody-mediated neutralization of human cytomegalovirus Sci. Immunol. 2017; 2 :eaan1457 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ) were fit as a rigid body into the cryo-EM map. The gO subunit was built de-novo into the high-resolution cryo-EM map. The structure of PDGFRα (PDB: 3MJG ) was used as a template for modeling of PDGFRα D1-D3 and the structure of zebrafish TGFβR3 (PDB: 6MZN ) was used as a template for modeling human TGFβR3 OD-2. The resulting model was fit as a rigid body into the cryo-EM map. After extensive rebuilding and manual adjustments, multiple rounds of real space refinement using the phenix.real_space_refinement ( Afonine et al., 2018 1. Afonine, P.V. ∙ Poon, B.K. ∙ Read, R.J. ... Real-space refinement in PHENIX for cryo-EM and crystallography Acta Crystallogr. D. Struct. Biol. 2018; 74 :531-544 Crossref Scopus (1516) PubMed Google Scholar ) tool was used to correct global structural differences between the initial model and the map. The model was further manually adjusted in Coot ( Emsley et al., 2010 11. Emsley, P. ∙ Lohkamp, B. ∙ Scott, W.G. ... Features and development of Coot Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :486-501 Crossref Scopus (20200) PubMed Google Scholar ) through iterative rounds of model building and real space refinements in Isolde ( Croll, 2018 10. Croll, T.I. ISOLDE: A physically realistic environment for model building into low-resolution electron-density maps Acta Crystallogr. D. Struct. Biol. 2018; 74 :519-530 Crossref Scopus (779) PubMed Google Scholar ) and Phenix ( Afonine et al., 2018 1. Afonine, P.V. ∙ Poon, B.K. ∙ Read, R.J. ... Real-space refinement in PHENIX for cryo-EM and crystallography Acta Crystallogr. D. Struct. Biol. 2018; 74 :531-544 Crossref Scopus (1516) PubMed Google Scholar ). The model was validated using phenix.validation_cryoem ( Afonine et al., 2018 1. Afonine, P.V. ∙ Poon, B.K. ∙ Read, R.J. ... Real-space refinement in PHENIX for cryo-EM and crystallography Acta Crystallogr. D. Struct. Biol. 2018; 74 :531-544 Crossref Scopus (1516) PubMed Google Scholar ) with built-in MolProbity scoring ( Williams et al., 2018 55. Williams, C.J. ∙ Headd, J.J. ∙ Moriarty, N.W. ... MolProbity: More and better reference data for improved all-atom structure validation Protein Sci. 2018; 27 :293-315 Crossref Scopus (2301) PubMed Google Scholar ). Figures were made using PyMOL (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, v.2.07 Schrödinger, LLC), UCSF ChimeraX ( Goddard et al., 2018 16. Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ∙ Meng, E.C. ... UCSF ChimeraX: Meeting modern challenges in visualization and analysis Protein Sci. 2018; 27 :14-25 Crossref Scopus (2591) PubMed Google Scholar ). 3D homology structural analysis was performed using the DALI server ( Holm, 2020 19. Holm, L. Using Dali for Protein Structure Comparison Methods Mol. Biol. 2020; 2112 :29-42 Crossref Scopus (353) PubMed Google Scholar ). Sequences were aligned using Clustal Omega ( Sievers et al., 2011 47. Sievers, F. ∙ Wilm, A. ∙ Dineen, D. ... Fast, scalable generation of high-quality protein multiple sequence alignments using Clustal Omega Mol. Syst. Biol. 2011; 7 :539 Crossref Scopus (10804) PubMed Google Scholar ) within JalView ( Waterhouse et al., 2009 53. Waterhouse, A.M. ∙ Procter, J.B. ∙ Martin, D.M.A. ... Jalview Version 2--a multiple sequence alignment editor and analysis workbench Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :1189-1191 Crossref Scopus (6757) PubMed Google Scholar ) and illustrated with ESPript 3.0 ( Robert and Gouet, 2014 38. Robert, X. ∙ Gouet, P. Deciphering key features in protein structures with the new ENDscript server Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 W320-4 Crossref Scopus (4576) Google Scholar ) followed by manual adjustment based on considerations from the PDGFRα-gHgLgO-13H11-MSL-109 or the TGFβR3-gHgLgO-13H11-MSL-109 structure models.
HCMV Trimer gHgLgO, PDGFRα and TGFβR3 alone or a combination of gHgLgO + PDGFRα, gHgLgO + TGFβR3 or gHgLgO + PDGFRα + TGFβR3 were co-incubated at a concentration of 3 μM in SEC-competition buffer (25 mM HEPES 7.5, 300 mM NaCl) for at least 60 min on ice and loaded on a Superose 6 3.2/300 column equilibrated in SEC-competition buffer.
The interactions between the PDGFRα proteins and the HCMV Trimer (WT and mutant) were analyzed by biolayer interferometry using an Octet Red96 system (ForteBio). All data were collected at 25°C using 96-well black flat bottom plates (Greiner Bio-One). For calculation of binding affinities, recombinant PDGFRα proteins were captured onto anti human Fc-coated (AHC) sensors (Sartorius), and tested for binding to the CMV trimer as soluble analyte. Sensors were equilibrated for 10 min before the assay in PBS, following manufacturer’s instructions. All steps, loading, baseline, association and dissociation were performed in PBS.
For comparison of relative binding between the HCMV trimer and the PDGFRα WT and mutant proteins, the PDGFRα proteins were captured onto AHC sensors, and tested for binding to the trimer as soluble analyte at 50 nM concentration. Binding to PDGFRα mutant proteins was represented relative to trimer binding to the PDGFRα WT protein. Binding units at the end of the association step were used to calculate the relative binding shown in the plot. In all cases, data was acquired using the Octet Red instrument (Forte Pall software version 9.0) and subsequently the Biaevaluation software version 4.1 (GE Healthcare) was utilized for calculations of kinetic parameters. Data were fit to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model.
The fibroblast cell line MRC-5 was used to study receptor phosphorylation and downstream signaling. MRC-5 were grown in RPMI media supplemented with 10% FBS, glutamine and antibiotics. Cells were cultured at 37°C and 5% CO 2 . The cells were seeded in M6 well plates, grown to ∼75% confluency and starved O/N prior to stimulation. The day of the assay, cells were stimulated with PDGF-AA (3.7 nM concentration), CMV trimer, or PDGF-AA:CMV trimer at increasing molar ratios. Stimulations were performed at 37°C for 10 minutes in serum free media. Following treatment, the cells were washed with cold PBS and lysed (lysis buffer: 50 mM Tris HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% (v/v) NP40, supplemented with protease (Roche) and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma)). Samples were diluted in loading buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using denaturing conditions, and analyzed by western blotting using a LI-COR instrument. Cell lysates were centrifuged for 20 minutes at 14,000 rpm and the resulting samples were diluted in reducing SDS-PAGE loading buffer (Thermo Fisher). Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE using NuPAGE Bis-Tris gels (Thermo Fisher) and imaged using a LI-COR instrument. Western blot images were not processed beyond modification of the image contrast and cropping of the region of interest to facilitate visualization. None of the lanes in the blots were removed, and the aforementioned modifications were applied to the entire image.
All primary antibodies used in this study were purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies. Secondary antibodies used for detection (IRDyes) were acquired from LI-COR Biosciences. All antibodies were used at the dilutions recommended by the manufacturer and incubations were performed O/N (primary antibodies) or 1hr at RT (Li-COR antibodies).
Human PDGF-AA used for cell stimulation was purchased from StemCell Technologies, Inc. All other recombinant proteins were produced in house.
In Figures 5 G–5I and 7 D the kinetic parameters are representative of two or three independent assays, as indicated in the figure legends, and calculated using the Biaevaluation software version 4.1 (GE Healthcare). Data were fit to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model. No methods were used to determine whether the data met assumptions of the statistical approach.
In Figures S1 , S4 , and S6 the resolution estimations of cryo-EM density maps are based on the 0.143 Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC) criterion ( Chen et al., 2013 5.
