Title: Tissue-resident FOLR2 + macrophages associate with CD8 + T cell infiltration in human breast cancer


Abstract: Summary

Macrophage infiltration is a hallmark of solid cancers, and overall macrophage infiltration correlates with lower patient survival and resistance to therapy. Tumor-associated macrophages, however, are phenotypically and functionally heterogeneous. Specific subsets of tumor-associated macrophage might be endowed with distinct roles on cancer progression and antitumor immunity. Here, we identify a discrete population of FOLR2 + tissue-resident macrophages in healthy mammary gland and breast cancer primary tumors. FOLR2 + macrophages localize in perivascular areas in the tumor stroma, where they interact with CD8 + T cells. FOLR2 + macrophages efficiently prime effector CD8 + T cells ex vivo . The density of FOLR2 + macrophages in tumors positively correlates with better patient survival. This study highlights specific roles for tumor-associated macrophage subsets and paves the way for subset-targeted therapeutic interventions in macrophages-based cancer therapies.

Section: Introduction

Macrophages are a major cellular component of the breast tumor microenvironment ( Cassetta and Pollard, 2018 15. Cassetta, L. ∙ Pollard, J.W. Targeting macrophages: therapeutic approaches in cancer Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2018; 17 :887-904 Google Scholar ). The extent of macrophage infiltration in tumors correlates with poor clinical outcome ( Zhao et al., 2017 83. Zhao, X. ∙ Qu, J. ∙ Sun, Y. ... Prognostic significance of tumor-associated macrophages in breast cancer: a meta-analysis of the literature Oncotarget. 2017; 8 :30576-30586 Google Scholar ). Indeed, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play protumorigenic roles by promoting angiogenesis, by providing tumor growth factors, and by enhancing tumor cell invasion and metastasis ( Ruffell and Coussens, 2015 69. Ruffell, B. ∙ Coussens, L.M. Macrophages and therapeutic resistance in cancer Cancer Cell. 2015; 27 :462-472 Google Scholar ). TAMs also exert immunosuppressive functions thereby preventing tumor cell destruction by NK and T lymphocytes ( Lewis and Pollard, 2006 45. Lewis, C.E. ∙ Pollard, J.W. Distinct role of macrophages in different tumor microenvironments Cancer Res. 2006; 66 :605-612 Google Scholar ; Engblom et al., 2016 28. Engblom, C. ∙ Pfirschke, C. ∙ Pittet, M.J. The role of myeloid cells in cancer therapies Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2016; 16 :447-462 Google Scholar ). Therefore, targeting TAM recruitment, survival, and function has become a major therapeutic goal ( Ries et al., 2014 66. Ries, C.H. ∙ Cannarile, M.A. ∙ Hoves, S. ... Targeting tumor-associated macrophages with anti-CSF-1R antibody reveals a strategy for cancer therapy Cancer Cell. 2014; 25 :846-859 Google Scholar ; Mantovani et al., 2017 53. Mantovani, A. ∙ Marchesi, F. ∙ Malesci, A. ... Tumour-associated macrophages as treatment targets in oncology Nat. Rev. Clin. Oncol. 2017; 14 :399-416 Google Scholar ). Even though the current paradigm ascribes protumorigenic functions to TAMs, several studies have highlighted protective roles for TAMs in specific disease stages or organs ( Ruffell and Coussens, 2015 69. Ruffell, B. ∙ Coussens, L.M. Macrophages and therapeutic resistance in cancer Cancer Cell. 2015; 27 :462-472 Google Scholar ; Bonapace et al., 2014 9. Bonapace, L. ∙ Coissieux, M.M. ∙ Wyckoff, J. ...

Patrolling monocytes control tumor metastasis to the lung Science. 2015; 350 :985-990 Google Scholar ). Distinct populations of macrophages with opposite pro- and anti-tumorigenic functions might coexist within the same tumor ( Mantovani et al., 2004 54. Mantovani, A. ∙ Sica, A. ∙ Sozzani, S. ... The chemokine system in diverse forms of macrophage activation and polarization Trends Immunol. 2004; 25 :677-686 Google Scholar ; Ali et al., 2016 1. Ali, H.R. ∙ Chlon, L. ∙ Pharoah, P.D.P. ... Patterns of immune infiltration in breast cancer and their clinical implications: a gene-expression-based retrospective study PLoS Med. 2016; 13 :e1002194 Google Scholar ). Therefore, establishing the extent of heterogeneity in the macrophage compartment is a prerequisite for the rational design of macrophage-targeting therapies. Macrophage heterogeneity might potentially arise from (1) alternative activation states ( Mantovani et al., 2017 53. Mantovani, A. ∙ Marchesi, F. ∙ Malesci, A. ... Tumour-associated macrophages as treatment targets in oncology Nat. Rev. Clin. Oncol. 2017; 14 :399-416 Google Scholar ), (2) imprinting by tissue- or tumor-associated cues defining macrophage niches ( Cassetta et al., 2019 14. Cassetta, L. ∙ Fragkogianni, S. ∙ Sims, A.H. ...

Guilliams, M. ∙ Scott, C.L. Does niche competition determine the origin of tissue-resident macrophages? Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2017; 17 :451-460 Google Scholar ), (3) distinct TAM ontogenetic origins (adult monocyte versus embryonic progenitors) ( Franklin et al., 2014 32. Franklin, R.A. ∙ Liao, W. ∙ Sarkar, A. ... The cellular and molecular origin of tumor-associated macrophages Science. 2014; 344 :921-925 Google Scholar ; Loyher et al., 2018 52. Loyher, P.-L. ∙ Hamon, P. ∙ Laviron, M. ... Macrophages of distinct origins contribute to tumor development in the lung The J. Exp. Med. 2018; 215 :2536-2553 Google Scholar ), and (4) tumor-induced systemic modification of circulating monocytes ( Gallina et al., 2006 33. Gallina, G. ∙ Dolcetti, L. ∙ Serafini, P. ...

CD163 + tumor-associated macrophage accumulation in breast cancer patients reflects both local differentiation signals and systemic skewing of monocytes Clin. Transl. Immunology. 2020; 9 :e1108 Google Scholar ). In human breast cancer (BC), macrophage infiltration has been assessed with markers such as CD14, CSF1R, or CD68 ( Ruffell et al., 2012 67. Ruffell, B. ∙ Au, A. ∙ Rugo, H.S. ... Leukocyte composition of human breast cancer Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109 :2796-2801 Google Scholar ; Cassetta et al., 2019 14.

Yuan, Z.-Y. ∙ Luo, R.-Z. ∙ Peng, R.-J. ... High Infiltration of Tumor-Associated Macrophages in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer is Associated with a Higher Risk of Distant Metastasis Dove Press, 2014 Google Scholar ). However, CD14 and CSF1R also mark undifferentiated monocytes, whereas CD68 expression among phagocytes is not fully characterized ( Colonna et al., 2004 20. Colonna, M. ∙ Trinchieri, G. ∙ Liu, Y.J. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells in immunity Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5 :1219-1226 Google Scholar ). Other markers like CD163, TIE2, MRC1/CD206, or MARCO have been implemented to assess TAM phenotypic heterogeneity ( Cassetta and Pollard, 2018 15. Cassetta, L. ∙ Pollard, J.W. Targeting macrophages: therapeutic approaches in cancer Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2018; 17 :887-904 Google Scholar ). Pioneer single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) studies have invalidated alternative activation as the main mechanism accounting for TAM heterogeneity ( Azizi et al., 2018 5. Azizi, E. ∙ Carr, A.J. ∙ Plitas, G. ... Single-cell map of diverse immune phenotypes in the breast tumor microenvironment Cell. 2018; 174 :1293-1308.e36 Google Scholar ). In summary, the phenotypic and functional diversities of TAM infiltrating human BC remain to be elucidated.
Here, we implement scRNA-seq of tumor-associated CD14 + HLA-DR + cells isolated from metastatic lymph nodes (LNs) and primary breast tumors to assess the cellular heterogeneity within the CD14 + compartment. We identify two phenotypically distinct macrophage populations: (1) TREM2 + macrophages expressing triggering receptor expressed by myeloid cells-2 ( TREM2 ) and osteopontin ( SPP1 ) genes, (2) FOLR2 + macrophages expressing folate receptor 2 (FOLR2), hyaluronan receptor ( LYVE-1 ), and mannose receptor C-Type 1 ( MRC1/CD206 ) genes. We show that TREM2 + and FOLR2 + TAMs are evolutionarily conserved between human and mouse BC. TREM2 + macrophages are poorly represented in healthy breast tissues but increase with tumor development. By contrast, we show that FOLR2 + macrophages are tissue-resident macrophages (TRMs) populating healthy mammary glands (MGs) prior the onset of cancer development. Specific gene signatures defining FOLR2 + macrophages correlate with better survival of patients with BC. Accordingly, FOLR2 + macrophages positively correlate with signatures of major cellular players of antitumor immunity, including CD8 + T cells. We further show that FOLR2 + macrophages locate in the tumor stroma near vessels and cluster with CD8 + T cell aggregates. This FOLR2 + macrophage/CD8 + T cell colocalization correlates with favorable clinical outcomes suggesting an antitumorigenic role for this newly characterized macrophage subset.

Section: Results

To unambiguously identify TAMs within breast tumors, we sought to define specific features enabling their distinction from infiltrating CD14 + CD1c − monocytes, CD14 + CD1c + inflammatory DCs/DC3 or CD14 − CD1c + cDC2 ( Villani et al., 2017 77. Villani, A.C. ∙ Satija, R. ∙ Reynolds, G. ... Single-cell RNA-seq reveals new types of human blood dendritic cells, monocytes, and progenitors Science. 2017; 356 :eaah4573 Google Scholar ; Bourdely et al., 2020 10. Bourdely, P. ∙ Anselmi, G. ∙ Vaivode, K. ... Transcriptional and functional analysis of CD1c + human dendritic cells identifies a CD163 + subset priming CD8 + CD103 + T cells Immunity. 2020; 53 :335-352.e8 Google Scholar ; Dutertre et al., 2019 27. Dutertre, C.A. ∙ Becht, E. ∙ Irac, S.E. ... Single-cell analysis of human mononuclear phagocytes reveals subset-defining markers and identifies circulating inflammatory dendritic cells Immunity. 2019; 51 :573-589.e8 Google Scholar ). First, we quantified mononuclear phagocytes of matched primary tumors—non-metastatic and metastatic LNs—from a cohort of treatment-naive patients with luminal BC ( Table S1 ). We found that CD1c − CD14 + monocyte/macrophage population increased most significantly in metastatic LNs as compared with matched non-metastatic LNs ( Figures 1 A and S1 A). CD14 + cell infiltration correlated with the extent of tumor invasion in LNs ( Figure 1 B). We next sought to characterize the heterogeneity within the entire tumor-infiltrating CD14 + cells in an unbiased manner. To this end, we isolated mononuclear phagocytes from metastatic LNs, primary tumors, and blood of untreated patients with luminal BC by FACS-sorting CD11c + HLA-DR + cells and performed scRNA-seq ( Figure 1 C; Table S1 ). We used the SEURAT pipeline to process the data ( Figure 1 D) and merged ∼18,000 myeloid cells from all the patients ( Figures 1 D and S1 B). Louvain graph-based clustering identified 4 clusters of mononuclear phagocytes and populations of cycling ( mKI67 , TOP2A , and CDC20 ) and “stressed” cells ( HSPA1A and HSPB1 ) ( Figure S1 C; Table S2 ). Cluster 0 (c0) was characterized by the selective expression of markers defining CD14 + CD16 − monocytes ( S100A8 , S100A9 , S100A12 , and VCAN ) ( Villani et al., 2017 77. Villani, A.C. ∙ Satija, R. ∙ Reynolds, G. ... Single-cell RNA-seq reveals new types of human blood dendritic cells, monocytes, and progenitors Science. 2017; 356 :eaah4573 Google Scholar ; Figures 1 D and 1E; Table S2 ). Cluster 1 (c1) was characterized by genes defining CD1c + DCs, whereas cluster 4 (c4) was identified as CD14 − CD16 + monocytes ( Villani et al., 2017 77. Villani, A.C. ∙ Satija, R. ∙ Reynolds, G. ... Single-cell RNA-seq reveals new types of human blood dendritic cells, monocytes, and progenitors Science. 2017; 356 :eaah4573 Google Scholar ; Dutertre et al., 2019 27. Dutertre, C.A. ∙ Becht, E. ∙ Irac, S.E. ... Single-cell analysis of human mononuclear phagocytes reveals subset-defining markers and identifies circulating inflammatory dendritic cells Immunity. 2019; 51 :573-589.e8 Google Scholar ; Bourdely et al., 2020 10. Bourdely, P. ∙ Anselmi, G. ∙ Vaivode, K. ... Transcriptional and functional analysis of CD1c + human dendritic cells identifies a CD163 + subset priming CD8 + CD103 + T cells Immunity. 2020; 53 :335-352.e8 Google Scholar ). Cluster 2 (c2) was identified as TAMs because it selectively expressed high levels of a TAM signature ( Figure 1 F; Azizi et al., 2018 5. Azizi, E. ∙ Carr, A.J. ∙ Plitas, G. ... Single-cell map of diverse immune phenotypes in the breast tumor microenvironment Cell. 2018; 174 :1293-1308.e36 Google Scholar ). Cluster 2 expressed high levels of APOE , APOC1 , C1QA , and C1QC enabling the distinction from monocytes ( Figures 1 E and S1 D). We show that homogenous expression of APOE selectively discriminate TAMs from both CD14 + monocytes and CD1c + DCs ( Figure 1 F). No other commonly used markers ( CSF1R , CD68 , and CD14 ) achieved this discrimination ( Figure 1 F). We next validated protein expression distinguishing macrophages/TAMs from monocytes within CD1c − CD14 + cells. The best monocyte/macrophage discrimination was obtained by staining with APOE and CCR2 ( Figures 1 G and S1 E). We analyzed the contribution of CCR2 + monocytes versus APOE + macrophages to the CD14 + cell compartment within luminal BC lesions and tumor-free tissues. We found that the frequency of APOE + macrophages increased with tumor burden, whereas the frequency of CCR2 + monocytes decreased ( Figure 1 G). Finally, we found that APOE + cells located near and inside the tumor lesions in metastatic LNs and primary tumors ( Figures 1 H and S1 F). Altogether, our results establish APOE as a specific marker to identify macrophages in luminal BC primary tumors and metastatic LNs.
We next investigated the heterogeneity of APOE + TAMs. Louvain graph-based clustering identified 3 clusters of TAMs ( Figures 2 A, S2 A, and S2B). Hierarchical clustering showed that clusters 0 and 1 (c0 and c1) were transcriptionally closer to each other as compared with cluster 2 (c2) ( Figure 2 B). To further explore the transcriptional heterogeneity found within the APOE + macrophages, we implemented single-cell regulatory network inference and clustering (SCENIC) to study the gene regulatory network (regulon) of each macrophage cluster. Hierarchical clustering revealed that c0 and c1 shared around half of their regulons including CEBPB and BHLHE41, whereas c2 presented mostly unique regulons like NR1H3 and MAF ( Figure 2 C; Table S2 ). Analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) revealed that FOLR2 , SEPP1 , SLC40A1 , MRC1 , and LYVE1 discriminated c2 from both c0 and c1 ( Figure 2 D; Table S2 ). Conversely, TREM2 , SPP1 , and ISG15 discriminated both c0 and c1 from c2 ( Figure 2 D; Table S2 ). Altogether, we show that FOLR2 is a defining marker for c2, whereas TREM2 defines c0 and c1 ( Figure 2 E). We conclude that APOE + TAMs comprise two distinct populations: the TREM2 + macrophages and the FOLR2 + macrophages.
We next sought to validate this finding by prospective isolation of these populations for bulk transcriptome analysis. We searched for surface proteins differentially expressed between the two populations. We failed to detect TREM2 at the cell surface of TAMs after tissue dissociation. Alternatively, we found that c1 (TREM2 high macrophages) specifically expressed and stained positive for CADM1 ( Figures 2 F, 2G, and S2 C). Flow cytometry analysis of FOLR2 and CADM1 expression revealed mutually exclusive expression patterns within CD11c + HLADR + XCR1 − CD1c − CCR2 − CD14 + macrophage population ( Figure 2 G). We isolated FOLR2 + CADM1 − and FOLR2 low CADM1 + macrophages from primary tumors and metastatic LNs by FACS sorting ( Figure S2 D). FOLR2 + CADM1 − macrophages presented a typical macrophage shape and were filled with vacuoles. In contrast, FOLR2 low CADM1 + macrophages were smaller in size, with a morphology closer to monocytes ( Figure 2 G). We next performed bulk RNA-seq on FOLR2 + CADM1 − macrophages, FOLR2 low CADM1 + macrophages, and CD14 + CCR2 + monocytes ( Figures 2 H–2J; Table S1 ). Hierarchical clustering showed that FOLR2 + CADM1 − macrophages from primary tumors and metastatic LNs clustered together away from FOLR2 low CADM1 + macrophages or CD14 + CCR2 + monocytes ( Figure 2 H). We confirmed our scRNA-seq results showing that FOLR2 + macrophages isolated from metastatic LNs or primary tumors expressed higher levels of FOLR2 , SEPP1 , SLC40A1 , and LYVE1 as compared with FOLR2 low CADM1 + macrophages and CD14 + CCR2 + monocytes ( Figures 2 I and S2 E). FOLR2 low CADM1 + macrophages from primary tumors clustered together with CD14 + CCR2 + monocytes ( Figure 2 H) but specifically expressed TREM2 and genes found to be overexpressed in c1 ( C3 , FN1 , and SPP1 ) of the scRNA-seq analysis ( Figure 2 J). Some of these phenotypic differences were confirmed by CyTOF profiling of CD14 + CCR2 − macrophages from metastatic LNs. Coexpression of LYVE1, MRC1/CD206, and CD163 was found in a macrophage population distinct from CADM1 + expressing macrophages ( Figure 2 K). Altogether, our results show that breast TAMs comprise two populations separable by their mutually exclusive expression of TREM2/CADM1 and FOLR2.
A recent study identifies the infiltration of TREM2 + macrophages as an event associated to cancer development ( Molgora et al., 2020 58. Molgora, M. ∙ Esaulova, E. ∙ Vermi, W. ... TREM2 modulation remodels the tumor myeloid landscape enhancing anti-PD-1 immunotherapy Cell. 2020; 182 :886-900.e17 Google Scholar ). Our data establish their transcriptional proximity to CD14 + CCR2 + monocytes in breast tumors ( Figure 2 H). These results suggest that TREM2 + CADM1 + macrophages arise from infiltration of circulating monocytes during tumor progression. The origin of FOLR2 + macrophages is not known, and we therefore wondered whether they correspond to mammary TRMs (i.e., present in healthy breast) or tumor-recruited monocyte-derived macrophages like the TREM2 + macrophages. To address this question, we quantified FOLR2 + macrophages by flow cytometry in healthy tissues versus luminal breast tumor lesion. We found that among APOE + macrophages, FOLR2 + macrophages were enriched in healthy and juxta-tumor tissues ( Figure 3 A). Upon tumor progression, the frequency of FOLR2 + macrophages got relatively diluted among APOE + macrophages by FOLR2 − macrophages (comprising TREM2 + macrophages) ( Figure 3 A). However, the population of FOLR2 + macrophages did not decrease in tumor lesion as their frequency among total live cells remain constant between healthy and tumor tissue ( Figure S3 A). The enrichment of FOLR2 + macrophages in adjacent normal tissue versus tumor lesions was also confirmed at the transcriptional level by analyzing BC samples of different subtypes (Her2 + , triple negative BC [TNBC], luminal) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database ( Figures 3 B and S3 B; Li et al., 2017 46. Li, T. ∙ Fan, J. ∙ Wang, B. ... TIMER: a web server for comprehensive analysis of tumor-infiltrating immune cells Cancer Res. 2017; 77 :e108-e110 Google Scholar ). In contrast, TREM2 transcripts were enriched in breast tumor lesions as compared with tumor-adjacent normal and nondisease healthy tissues ( Figures 3 B and S3 B). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis revealed that FOLR2 + macrophages were present in all subtypes of BC ( Figure 3 C). Bulk RNA-seq ( Figure 2 J) and CyTOF ( Figure 2 K) analysis of FOLR2 + macrophages show that FOLR2 + macrophages specifically express LYVE1 and MRC1/CD206, both markers of perivascular (PV) macrophages ( Lin et al., 2006 49.

Chakarov, S. ∙ Lim, H.Y. ∙ Tan, L. ... Two distinct interstitial macrophage populations coexist across tissues in specific subtissular niches Science. 2019; 363 :eaau0964 Google Scholar ). Confocal imaging on tumor resection specimens showed that indeed FOLR2 + CD206 + macrophages located near CD31 + vessels in both tumor and adjacent tissue ( Figures 3 D and S3 C). Altogether, these results show that FOLR2 + macrophages are PV TRMs associated with healthy MGs.
We next analyzed macrophage subsets in healthy or malignant MGs in mouse models, enabling a longitudinal analysis of immune populations in steady state and during tumor progression. In a published scRNA-seq dataset performed on hematopoietic cells from healthy MGs ( Han et al., 2018 38. Han, X. ∙ Wang, R. ∙ Zhou, Y. ... Mapping the mouse cell atlas by microwell-seq Cell. 2018; 172 :1091-1107.e17 Google Scholar ), we identified a subset of TRMs coexpressing Folr2 , Mrc1 , and Lyve1 , like human FOLR2 + macrophages ( Figure S3 D). These cells align to previously described MRC1 + LYVE1 + TRMs ( Franklin et al., 2014 32. Franklin, R.A. ∙ Liao, W. ∙ Sarkar, A. ...

Tissue-resident macrophages promote extracellular matrix homeostasis in the mammary gland stroma of nulliparous mice Elife. 2020; 9 :e57438 Google Scholar ; Figure S3 G). We next performed scRNA-seq on CD45 + CD3 − CD19 − B220 − NKP46 − cells isolated from breast tumors of the MMTV-PyMT (PyMT) autochthonous model developing mammary tumors that morphology closely resemble human luminal BC ( Lin et al., 2003 48.

The cellular and molecular origin of tumor-associated macrophages Science. 2014; 344 :921-925 Google Scholar ; Figures 3 E and S3 E). Contaminating lymphocytes, Ly6c2 + monocytes (c3), Ly6c2 − Nr4a1 high monocytes (c6), cycling cells (c4), and cells with high content of ribosomal genes (c1) were excluded ( Figure S3 E). Among the remaining Fcgr1 + cells, we identified 3 clusters of macrophages, among which, two expressed Cadm1 (c0 and c1) ( Figure 3 E). In addition, we identified a discrete population of Folr2 + Mrc1 + macrophages (c2). Mouse and human FOLR2 + macrophages shared the expression of FOLR2 , MRC1 , LYVE1 , and MAF ( Figure 3 F; Table S3 ). On the other hand, Cadm1 + Cx3cr1 + mouse macrophages (c0 and c1) resembled human CADM1 + TREM2 high macrophages (c1, Figure 2 A) and shared the expression of CADM1 , HAVCR2 , IFI44 ( Figure 3 F; Table S3 ). Of note, the Trem2 expression pattern was more conspicuous in murine as compared with human macrophages ( Figure S3 F). To probe the similarity between human and mouse FOLR2 + macrophages, we performed a similarity analysis across orthologous genes at the level of each cell ( Figure 3 G; Table S3 ). This unbiased analysis confirmed the marker-based alignment of murine Folr2 + macrophage to human FOLR2 + macrophages. Conversely, the Cadm1 + Cx3cr1 + murine macrophages (c0 and c1) presented high similarity with CADM1 + TREM2 + human macrophages. Thus, we conclude that FOLR2 + macrophages are evolutionarily conserved between murine and human luminal mammary tumors.
We next analyzed longitudinally the dynamics of FOLR2 + and CADM1 + macrophages during tumor development by quantifying MG macrophages in healthy littermate (WT), prelesion PyMT mice, neoplastic lesions, early carcinoma, and advanced carcinoma. We found that FOLR2 + macrophages constitute around 80% of total macrophages in healthy MG (WT) ( Figures 3 H and S3 I). The frequency, but not the absolute number, of FOLR2 + macrophages progressively decreased upon carcinoma progression reaching a minimum of 10%–20% in advanced carcinoma lesion of 20-week-old PyMT mice ( Figures 3 H, S3 H, and S3J). In contrast, carcinoma development was accompanied by the de novo expansion of CADM1 + macrophages representing up to 80% of total macrophage in 20-week-old PyMT mice ( Figure 3 H). Altogether, we conclude that FOLR2 + macrophages represent an evolutionarily conserved TRM subset persisting in advanced carcinoma.
Macrophages are generally thought to promote tumor growth and inhibit antitumor immunity. This is particularly well established in mouse models ( Lin et al., 2006 49. Lin, E.Y. ∙ Li, J.F. ∙ Gnatovskiy, L. ... Macrophages regulate the angiogenic switch in a mouse model of breast cancer Cancer Res. 2006; 66 :11238-11246 Google Scholar ; Qian et al., 2011 64. Qian, B.Z. ∙ Li, J. ∙ Zhang, H. ... CCL2 recruits inflammatory monocytes to facilitate breast-tumour metastasis Nature. 2011; 475 :222-225 Google Scholar ; Franklin et al., 2014 32. Franklin, R.A. ∙ Liao, W. ∙ Sarkar, A. ... The cellular and molecular origin of tumor-associated macrophages Science. 2014; 344 :921-925 Google Scholar ; Linde et al., 2018 50. Linde, N. ∙ Casanova-Acebes, M. ∙ Sosa, M.S. ... Macrophages orchestrate breast cancer early dissemination and metastasis Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :21 Google Scholar ). In human, macrophages generally correlate with poor prognosis and higher tumor grade. However, clinical studies have probed the association of macrophages to patient survival by using markers shared by DCs, monocytes, and macrophages ( CSF1R , CD68 , MRC1/CD206 , and CD163 e.g ) ( Figures S2 F and S2G). Therefore, we wondered whether FOLR2 + macrophages are similarly associated with worse survival in patients with BC. To this end, we defined gene signatures enabling to infer the abundance of total macrophages or the FOLR2 + macrophage subset within bulk tumor transcriptomes. Three genes ( C1QA , C1QB , and C1QC ) define a core macrophage signature shared by the 3 macrophage clusters identified in this study ( Figures 2 A and 4 A) and suffice to distinguish macrophages from other leukocytes lineages ( Figures 4 A and 4B; Table S2 ). Three genes ( FOLR2 , SEPP1 , and SLC40A1 ) uniquely distinguish FOLR2 + macrophages from other macrophages and other leukocytes lineages ( Figures 4 A and 4B; Azizi et al., 2018 5. Azizi, E. ∙ Carr, A.J. ∙ Plitas, G. ... Single-cell map of diverse immune phenotypes in the breast tumor microenvironment Cell. 2018; 174 :1293-1308.e36 Google Scholar ; Table S2 ). LYVE1 was not included in the signature because of its endothelial expression. We analyzed the representation of these gene signatures within bulk transcriptomes of luminal BC ( Curtis et al., 2012 21. Curtis, C. ∙ Shah, S.P. ∙ Chin, S.F. ... The genomic and transcriptomic architecture of 2,000 breast tumours reveals novel subgroups Nature. 2012; 486 :346-352 Google Scholar ). In accordance with previous reports ( Ruffell and Coussens, 2015 69. Ruffell, B. ∙ Coussens, L.M. Macrophages and therapeutic resistance in cancer Cancer Cell. 2015; 27 :462-472 Google Scholar ), we found that the highest level of macrophage infiltration correlated with worse overall survival ( Figures 4 C and S4 A). In stark contrast, high FOLR2 gene signature correlated with increased overall survival ( Figures 4 C and S4 A). The association between the FOLR2 gene-signature and patient clinical outcome was confirmed in an independent BC patient cohort using the same cutoff ( Wang et al., 2005a 79. Wang, Y. ∙ Klijn, J.G.M. ∙ Zhang, Y. ... Gene-expression profiles to predict distant metastasis of lymph-node-negative primary breast cancer Lancet. 2005; 365 :671-679 Google Scholar ; Figure S4 B). We also analyzed the association between FOLR2 protein expression and patient prognosis within 52 ER + /HER2 − patients with BC from the CPTAC dataset. We found that FOLR2 protein abundance positively correlated with better survival ( Figure 4 C). We next wanted to directly assess if the cellular density of FOLR2 + macrophages was associated with favorable clinical outcomes. To this end, we used multispectral imaging to analyze tissue microarrays comprising tumors from two retrospective and independent cohorts of patients with BC. We stained the tumors for FOLR2, cytokeratin (CK), and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and calculated the cellular density of FOLR2 + macrophages ( Figure 4 D). Using the best performing threshold as a cutoff, we found that FOLR2 + macrophage density positively correlated with patient survival ( Figure 4 E). Since FOLR2 + macrophages are a tissue-resident population in healthy MG, FOLR2 mRNA abundance could be associated to smaller tumors. To test whether this could be a confounding factor, we analyzed the level of expression of FOLR2 mRNA for breast tumors of different stages and grade. We found no significant differences in FOLR2 expression between grades and a slight increase in late-stage tumors ( Figure S4 C). Moreover, multivariate analysis of the prognostic value of the FOLR2 gene signature adjusted for various clinical parameters showed that the FOLR2 gene signature was an independent prognostic factor correlated with better survival of patients with luminal BC ( Figure S4 D, S4E, and S4F). Altogether, these results showed that the FOLR2 gene signature and FOLR2 + macrophage abundance associate with better prognosis in patients with BC.
We have shown that FOLR2 + macrophages are MG TRMs. Moreover, others have recently shown that macrophages expressing FOLR2 are found in healthy human tissues ( Samaniego et al., 2014 70. Samaniego, R. ∙ Palacios, B.S. ∙ Domiguez-Soto, Á. ... Macrophage uptake and accumulation of folates are polarization-dependent in vitro and in vivo and are regulated by activin A J. Leukoc. Biol. 2014; 95 :797-808 Google Scholar ; Sharma et al., 2020 71. Sharma, A. ∙ Seow, J.J.W. ∙ Dutertre, C.-A. ... Onco-fetal reprogramming of endothelial cells drives immunosuppressive macrophages in hepatocellular carcinoma Cell. 2020; 183 :377-394.e21 Google Scholar ; Thomas et al., 2021 73. Thomas, J.R. ∙ Appios, A. ∙ Zhao, X. ... Phenotypic and functional characterization of first-trimester human placental macrophages, Hofbauer cells J. Exp. Med. 2021; 218 :e20200891 Google Scholar ). Therefore, we wondered whether we could detect FOLR2 + macrophages across cancer types. To address this question, we analyzed the spatial distribution of FOLR2 + cells in 80 histological tumor sections of distinct human cancers ( Table S1 ). We found FOLR2 + macrophages across all these cancers ( Figures 5 A and S5 A). Spatial distribution quantification showed that FOLR2 + cells were consistently found within the tumor stroma and rarely infiltrated tumor nests ( Figures 5 A and S5 B). We stained FOLR2 and TREM2 on serial sections of various cancer types and showed that they were often spatially separated ( Figure 5 B). TREM2 + macrophages infiltrate or localize close to the tumor nest, whereas FOLR2 + macrophages largely locate in the tumor stroma ( Figure 5 B). This spatial distribution was found in hepatocellular ( Figure 5 Ba), lung ( Figure 5 Bb), and pancreatic carcinomas ( Figure 5 Bc). In some cancers, TREM2 + cells were found in both tumor stroma and tumor nests ( Figures 5 Bd and S5 C), whereas FOLR2 + cells remain located in the tumor stroma. Altogether, these results show that FOLR2 + and TREM2 + macrophages are associated with specific locations in the tumor microenvironment across various cancer types.
To quantitatively assess the spatial distribution of FOLR2 + and TREM2 + macrophages in breast tumors, we used multispectral imaging on the tissue microarray comprising tumors from 122 patients ( Figure 4 D). Tumor nests were identified by their expression of CK ( Figure S5 D). Automated classification of tumor regions (tumor nest CK + versus tumor stroma CK NEG ) and spatial distribution of FOLR2 + and TREM2 + cells were performed ( Figure S5 D). Consistent with our IHC results, we found that FOLR2 + macrophages located in the tumor stroma at a mean distance of 95 μm from the tumor nest ( Figures 5 C and S5 E). By contrast, TREM2 + macrophages were found inside tumor nests and at the invasive margin near to tumor nests (mean distance 47 μm, Figure S5 E). TREM2 + macrophages surrounding the tumor nests often formed cells clusters (see IFs Figures S2 C, S5 E, and S5F). We conclude that FOLR2 + macrophages mainly locate in the tumor stroma and are further away from tumor nests as compared with TREM2 + macrophages ( Figure 5 C). In the tissue microarrays from cohorts 1 and 2 ( Figures 4 D and 4E), TREM2 + cell density was not reproducibly and significantly associated with survival ( Figure S5 G). Interestingly, TREM2 or the TREM2 gene-signature mRNA levels in the TCGA whole tumor transcriptome dataset was associated with worse survival in TNBC ( Table S4 tab “TCGA”), kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD), low grade glioma (LGG), and liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) ( Table S4 ; Figure S5 H). To test whether FOLR2 + and TREM2 + macrophage abundance in tumor stroma was associated with clinical outcome, we analyzed a microarray dataset generated by laser capture microdissection of BC peritumor stroma ( Finak et al., 2008 30. Finak, G. ∙ Bertos, N. ∙ Pepin, F. ... Stromal gene expression predicts clinical outcome in breast cancer Nat. Med. 2008; 14 :518-527 Google Scholar ). We found that the FOLR2 gene signature strongly associated with better survival and that low FOLR2 gene-signature expressers had poor clinical outcome ( Figure 5 D). Conversely, patients with higher expression of the TREM2 gene signature had decreased survival probability and high expresser patients felt into the poor outcome patient group ( Figure 5 D).
In sum, we conclude that FOLR2 + and TREM2 + macrophages are spatially separated within the tumor microenvironment and that their abundance in tumor stroma associates to distinct clinical outcome for patients with BC.
To gain further functional insight, we used the FOLR2 gene signature or FOLR2 expression alone to correlate abundance of FOLR2 + macrophages with other immune and stromal cell types in the tumor microenvironment ( Figure 6 A; Table S4 ). We found that the FOLR2 gene signature (or FOLR2 gene) positively correlated with known players of antitumor immunity like CD8 + T cells, DCs, B cells, and tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) ( Figures 6 A and S6 A). In contrast, TREM2 + macrophage gene signature or TREM2 expression alone did not correlate with T cells, CD8 + T cells, NK cells, or B cells ( Figure 6 A). In addition, the highest level of FOLR2 expression in bulk tumor transcriptomes coincides, in the same tumor, with coordinated infiltration by multiple lymphocyte lineages and a gene signature of TLS ( Figure 6 B). No correlation was found when patients were stratified according to levels of TREM2 transcript ( Figure 6 B). We analyzed the gene pathways represented in all genes positively correlated to FOLR2 (or TREM2 ) expression in whole tumor transcriptome ( Figure S6 B). We found a strong correlation between FOLR2 expression in tumors and various immune pathways, including TCR and PD-1 signaling and antigen processing. We also analyzed gene pathways enriched in FOLR2 + macrophages as compared with CADM1 + TREM2 + macrophages in our bulk RNA-seq dataset and found that chemotaxis and functional modules of immune response regulation were gene pathways enriched in FOLR2 + macrophages ( Figures 6 C and S6 C; Bindea et al., 2009 8. Bindea, G. ∙ Mlecnik, B. ∙ Hackl, H. ... ClueGO: a cytoscape plug-in to decipher functionally grouped gene ontology and pathway annotation networks Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :1091-1093 Google Scholar ). Altogether, these results suggest that FOLR2 + macrophages are part of an immune contexture underlying the onset of antitumor immunity.
Since CD8 + T cells are associated to better survival in various cancer types including BC ( DeNardo et al., 2011 25. DeNardo, D.G. ∙ Brennan, D.J. ∙ Rexhepaj, E. ... Leukocyte complexity predicts breast cancer survival and functionally regulates response to chemotherapy Cancer Discov. 2011; 1 :54-67 Google Scholar ; Ali et al., 2014 2. Ali, H.R. ∙ Provenzano, E. ∙ Dawson, S.J. ... Association between CD8 + T-cell infiltration and breast cancer survival in 12,439 patients Ann. Oncol. 2014; 25 :1536-1543 Google Scholar ; Pagès et al., 2018 62. Pagès, F. ∙ Mlecnik, B. ∙ Marliot, F. ... International validation of the consensus Immunoscore for the classification of colon cancer: a prognostic and accuracy study Lancet. 2018; 391 :2128-2139 Google Scholar ), we investigated whether FOLR2 + macrophages were interacting with tumor-infiltrating CD8 + T cells. We used confocal microscopy on tumor resection samples and found that FOLR2 + macrophages located near CD31 + vessels were closely associated with CD8 + T cell aggregates ( Figure 6 D). To confirm the spatial association between FOLR2 + macrophages and CD8 + T cells, we stained the previous tissue microarray patient cohorts for both CD8 + and FOLR2 + cells and calculated their respective cellular density. FOLR2 + and CD8 + cell densities were not significantly different between BC subtypes nor between tumor stages and grades ( Figures S6 D and S6E). However, tumors with high FOLR2 + macrophage content had significantly higher CD8 + T cell density than tumors with low FOLR2 + macrophage content ( Figures 6 E and S6 F). There was no significant association between the abundance of TREM2 + cells and CD8 + cell infiltration ( Figures S5 F and S6 F). FOLR2 + macrophages could also be detected within TLS ( Figure S6 G). Altogether, these results show that stroma-associated FOLR2 + macrophages are structural component of lymphoid aggregates near tumor nests.
To further investigate whether FOLR2 + macrophages productively engage with CD8 + T cells, we performed confocal live imaging on fresh human BC lesions. We stained endogenous CD8 + T cells, FOLR2 + macrophages, and EPCAM + tumor cells from the tumor lesion with fluorescently coupled antibodies against CD8, FOLR2, and EPCAM and subsequently imaged the cellular dynamics by time-lapse microscopy ( Figure 6 F). We observed that FOLR2 + macrophages localized within the tumor stroma and formed a network of sessile cells with active membrane ruffling ( Video S1 ). Quantification of the speed of displacement of CD8 + T cells showed a heterogeneous behavior with more or less motile cells. Importantly, we reproducibly found that CD8 + T cells reduced their speed and established long-lasting contacts with FOLR2 + macrophages ( Video S1 ). This was in contrast with a higher motility of CD8 + T cells in FOLR2-deprived tumor regions ( Figure 6 F; Videos S2 and S3 ). We conclude that CD8 + T cells establish prolonged interactions with FOLR2 + macrophages, a behavior likely to promote T cell activation. In line with this result, FOLR2 expression in whole tumor transcriptome positively correlated with genes controlling cytotoxic function in T cells ( GZMA , GZMB , GZMK , PFR1 , KLRB1 , and KLRD1 ) but not with genes of T cell dysfunction like LAG3 ( Figure 6 G). TREM2 expression showed no significant correlation with genes controlling the cytotoxic function of CD8 + T cells.

It has been previously proposed that TAMs in the tumor stroma of lung or in pleural and peritoneal cavities sequester T cells from reaching the tumors and may have a negative impact on antitumor immunity ( Peranzoni et al., 2018 63. Peranzoni, E. ∙ Lemoine, J. ∙ Vimeux, L. ... Macrophages impede CD8 T cells from reaching tumor cells and limit the efficacy of anti-PD-1 treatment Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115 :E4041-E4050 Google Scholar ; Chow et al., 2021 18. Chow, A. ∙ Schad, S. ∙ Green, M.D. ... Tim-4 + cavity-resident macrophages impair anti-tumor CD8 + T cell immunity Cancer Cell. 2021; 39 :973-988.e9 Google Scholar ). In other studies, long-lasting interactions between antigen presenting cells and T cells precede T cell activation and may therefore promote T cell immunity ( Hugues et al., 2004 40. Hugues, S. ∙ Fetler, L. ∙ Bonifaz, L. ... Distinct T cell dynamics in lymph nodes during the induction of tolerance and immunity Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5 :1235-1242 Google Scholar ; Mempel et al., 2004 57. Mempel, T.R. ∙ Henrickson, S.E. ∙ Von Andrian, U.H. T-cell priming by dendritic cells in lymph nodes occurs in three distinct phases Nature. 2004; 427 :154-159 Google Scholar ). To assess whether CD8 + T cell/macrophages interactions translate into favorable clinical outcome in BC, we performed a quantitative spatial analysis of the cellular interactions between CD8 + T cells and macrophage subsets in T cell-infiltrated tumors. To this end, we performed multiplex imaging of tumors from <60 patients with BC, in which the density of CD8 + T cells was superior to 50 CD8 + T cells per mm 2 . We quantified the percentage of CD8 + T cells in close proximity (<30 μm) with either FOLR2 + or TREM2 + macrophages and stratified the patients according to the percentage “high” or “low” of CD8 + T cells in close contact with these two macrophage subsets. We found that a high percentage of CD8 + T cells in close contact with FOLR2 + macrophages associated with a better outcome for patients with BC, whereas this was not the case for CD8 + T cells interacting with TREM2 + macrophages ( Figure S6 H). We therefore conclude that tumor-infiltrating CD8 + T cells actively engage with FOLR2 + macrophages and that this interaction positively correlates with CD8 + T cell activation and patient survival.
Nascent tumors have been shown to engage in cellular cross talk with TRMs, which in turn promote tumor growth, motility, and invasiveness ( Cassetta and Pollard, 2018 15. Cassetta, L. ∙ Pollard, J.W. Targeting macrophages: therapeutic approaches in cancer Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2018; 17 :887-904 Google Scholar ). To explore the functional characteristics of FOLR2 + macrophages, we turn to the PyMT BC murine model. First, we ask whether FOLR2 + macrophages of healthy MG would respond to the developing tumor. To this end, we used bulk RNA-seq to profile FOLR2 + macrophages isolated from healthy versus small or medium tumor murine MGs ( Figures 7 A, 7B, and S7 A). Principal component (PC) analysis using the 10,000 most variable genes showed that FOLR2 + macrophages isolated from mammary tumors changed their transcriptomic profile in a tumor-size dependent manner as seen by the variations in the PC2 axis ( Figure 7 A). Interestingly, the transcriptome of CADM1 + macrophages was not influenced by the tumor size and clustered separately from FOLR2 + macrophages. We found 6,139 DEG between FOLR2 + and CADM1 + macrophages isolated from the same tumors. We conclude that FOLR2 + macrophages respond to the developing tumor but remain separable cellular entities from CADM1 + macrophages. We found 1,356 DEG between mammary tumor FOLR2 + macrophages and healthy MG FOLR2 + macrophages. Among these DEG, mammary tumor FOLR2 + macrophages expressed genes involved in the positive regulation of immune system processes including B and T cell chemoattractants ( Ccl6 to 9 , Ccl12 , Cxcl2 , Cxcl13 , Cxcl14 , and Cxcl16 ), adhesion molecules ( Icam1 , Vcam1 , and Fn1 ), and lysosomal proteins ( Ctse and Rab32 ) ( Figures 7 B and 7C). In contrast, FOLR2 + macrophages isolated from healthy MGs were enriched in genes regulating metabolic processes ( Igf1 , Srebf2 , and Abcd2 ) ( Figures 7 B and 7C). Therefore, our data show that FOLR2 + TRMs respond to tumor development.
Macrophage activation in tumors is often referred as “proinflammatory/M1” versus “anti-inflammatory/M2” ( Mantovani et al., 2002 55. Mantovani, A. ∙ Sozzani, S. ∙ Locati, M. ... Macrophage polarization: tumor-associated macrophages as a paradigm for polarized M2 mononuclear phagocytes Trends Immunol. 2002; 23 :549-555 Google Scholar ; Murray et al., 2014 59. Murray, P.J. ∙ Allen, J.E. ∙ Biswas, S.K. ... Macrophage activation and polarization: nomenclature and experimental guidelines Immunity. 2014; 41 :14-20 Google Scholar ). To test whether mammary tumor FOLR2 + and CADM1 + macrophage subsets harbor such functional specialization, we analyzed the expression of genes defining M1 or M2 gene signatures in the two macrophage subsets ( Azizi et al., 2018 5. Azizi, E. ∙ Carr, A.J. ∙ Plitas, G. ... Single-cell map of diverse immune phenotypes in the breast tumor microenvironment Cell. 2018; 174 :1293-1308.e36 Google Scholar ). We found that both mammary tumor FOLR2 + and CADM1 + macrophages concomitantly express individual M1 and M2 genes ( Figure 7 D). For example, FOLR2 + macrophages expressed Cd80 , Cd40 , and Il6 “M1 genes” and Cd163 , Mrc1 , and Il10 “M2 genes.” CADM1 + macrophages expressed Cd86 , Cxcl9 , and Il12b “M1 genes” and Vegfa , Cd276 , and Tgfb3 “M2 genes.” This shows that macrophage activation in the tumor microenvironment does not fit with the in vitro M1/M2 polarization model and reveals the complexity of macrophage activation in the tumor microenvironment. Interestingly, mammary tumor FOLR2 + and CADM1 + macrophage subsets expressed distinct sets of functional genes that could be linked to T cell activation ( Figures 7 D and S7 B). Therefore, to directly test the T cell-activation potential of the macrophage subsets, we set up two assays using FOLR2 + and CADM1 + macrophages isolated from the same tumors and cocultured with CD8 + T cells. First, we set up a T cell suppression assay, in which purified TAMs were cocultured with polyclonal activated CD8 + T cells. Here, FOLR2 + macrophage did not display suppressive activity. Instead, FOLR2 + macrophage improved CD8 + T cell proliferation and differentiation (loss of CD62L and upregulation of CD44 and CD25) ( Figure S7 C). CADM1 + macrophages did not suppress CD8 + T cell activation either, but their ability to promote effector T cell differentiation was weaker than that of FOLR2 + macrophages ( Figure S7 C). In previous studies ( Ruffell et al., 2014 68. Ruffell, B. ∙ Chang-Strachan, D. ∙ Chan, V. ... Macrophage IL-10 blocks CD8 + T cell-dependent responses to chemotherapy by suppressing IL-12 expression in intratumoral dendritic cells Cancer Cell. 2014; 26 :623-637 Google Scholar ; Katzenelenbogen et al., 2020 42. Katzenelenbogen, Y. ∙ Sheban, F. ∙ Yalin, A. ... Coupled scRNA-seq and intracellular protein activity reveal an immunosuppressive role of TREM2 in Cancer Cell. 2020; 182 :872-885.e19 Google Scholar ), immunosuppressive activity was restricted to MHCII NEG tumor-associated myeloid cells. Instead, MHCII + TAMs were not exerting T cell inhibition. Here, we show that both CADM1 + and FOLR2 + TAMs express high levels of MHCII ( Figure 3 H) consistent with their lack of immunosuppressive activity. Since neither FOLR2 + and CADM1 + macrophage strongly suppressed T cell expansion, we set up an antigen-specific T cell-priming assay. Purified FOLR2 + and CADM1 + macrophages were loaded with the OTI-specific SIINFEKL peptide, washed, and subsequently cocultured with naive OTI CD8 + T cells. In comparison to CADM1 + macrophages isolated from the same tumors, FOLR2 + macrophages showed higher capacity to induce the activation of naive T cells, their expansion, their polyfunctionality (IL-2, IFN-γ, and TNF-α), and cytotoxic function (expression of granzyme B) ( Figures 7 E and 7F). Furthermore, we found that FOLR2 + macrophages isolated from healthy MGs did not efficiently activate OTI CD8 + T cells, whereas FOLR2 + macrophages isolated from mammary tumors could induce T cell expansion and differentiation ( Figure 7 E). These results confirm that FOLR2 + macrophages are activated during tumor development and acquire the ability to prime CD8 + T cells. In sum, we provide evidence that FOLR2 + macrophages do not behave like immunosuppressive cells. Instead, tumor-associated FOLR2 + macrophages are potent antigen presenting cells displaying the functional ability to trigger CD8 + T cell activation.

Section: Discussion

We have identified an evolutionarily conserved TRM population expressing FOLR2 that is present in both human and mouse healthy MG. Human FOLR2 + macrophages express MRC1 and LYVE1 and align to murine MRC1 + TRMs that had been described in adult MG of healthy nulliparous mice ( Jäppinen et al., 2019 41. Jäppinen, N. ∙ Félix, I. ∙ Lokka, E. ... Fetal-derived macrophages dominate in adult mammary glands Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :281 Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2020 78. Wang, Y. ∙ Chaffee, T.S. ∙ LaRue, R.S. ... Tissue-resident macrophages promote extracellular matrix homeostasis in the mammary gland stroma of nulliparous mice Elife. 2020; 9 :e57438 Google Scholar ). In mice, MRC1 + TRMs arise from fetal precursors as demonstrated by genetic labeling in Csf1r Mer-iCre-Mer or Cx3cr1 Cre-ERT2 mice ( Jäppinen et al., 2019 41. Jäppinen, N. ∙ Félix, I. ∙ Lokka, E. ... Fetal-derived macrophages dominate in adult mammary glands Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :281 Google Scholar ) and are locally maintained in adult mice through self-renewal ( Wang et al., 2020 78. Wang, Y. ∙ Chaffee, T.S. ∙ LaRue, R.S. ... Tissue-resident macrophages promote extracellular matrix homeostasis in the mammary gland stroma of nulliparous mice Elife. 2020; 9 :e57438 Google Scholar ). MRC1 + TRMs coexist with a minor fraction of monocyte-derived, intraductal CX3CR1 high MRC1 − TRMs expanding during tissue remodeling imposed by lactation ( Dawson et al., 2020 23. Dawson, C.A. ∙ Pal, B. ∙ Vaillant, F. ... Tissue-resident ductal macrophages survey the mammary epithelium and facilitate tissue remodelling Nat. Cell Biol. 2020; 22 :546-558 Google Scholar ). Interestingly, most breast tumor-invading murine macrophages align transcriptionally to healthy intraductal CX3CR1 high MRC1 − TRM ( Dawson et al., 2020 23. Dawson, C.A. ∙ Pal, B. ∙ Vaillant, F. ... Tissue-resident ductal macrophages survey the mammary epithelium and facilitate tissue remodelling Nat. Cell Biol. 2020; 22 :546-558 Google Scholar ). Altogether, these findings highlight the ontogenetic and functional diversities within MG macrophage subsets. Here, we identify FOLR2 + human macrophages as orthologs of murine MRC1 + breast TRMs. We found that human FOLR2 + macrophages represent the main macrophage population in healthy breast tissue, thereby qualifying for MG TRMs. In contrast, we show that CADM1 + TREM2 + macrophages are scarce in healthy tissue and increase in primary tumors. We show that human CADM1 + TREM2 + macrophages align with murine monocyte-derived CX3CR1 high MRC1 − TAMs. Our bulk RNA-seq analysis of human CADM1 + TREM2 + macrophages demonstrate their transcriptional closeness to CCR2 + monocytes further suggesting a monocytic origin. CADM1 + TREM2 + macrophages are likely to align to TREM2 + macrophages recently identified in multiple cancer types ( Molgora et al., 2020 58. Molgora, M. ∙ Esaulova, E. ∙ Vermi, W. ... TREM2 modulation remodels the tumor myeloid landscape enhancing anti-PD-1 immunotherapy Cell. 2020; 182 :886-900.e17 Google Scholar ).
Recent studies have highlighted protumorigenic roles for murine TRMs. For instance, depletion of embryonic-derived TRMs delays the progression of tumor lesions in pancreatic cancer ( Zhu et al., 2017 84. Zhu, Y. ∙ Herndon, J.M. ∙ Sojka, D.K. ... Tissue-resident macrophages in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma originate from embryonic hematopoiesis and promote tumor progression Immunity. 2017; 47 :323-338.e6 Google Scholar ). However, the impact on overall survival has not been assessed. Also, depletion of CD163 + TRMs in ovarian cancer reduces epithelial to mesenchymal transition and overall tumor growth ( Etzerodt et al., 2020 29. Etzerodt, A. ∙ Moulin, M. ∙ Doktor, T.K. ... Tissue-resident macrophages in omentum promote metastatic spread of ovarian cancer J. Exp. Med. 2020; 217 :e20191869 Google Scholar ). CD169 + alveolar macrophages promote epithelial to mesenchymal transition of lung cancer cells in vitro ( Casanova-Acebes et al., 2021 13. Casanova-Acebes, M. ∙ Dalla, E. ∙ Leader, A.M. ... Tissue-resident macrophages provide a pro-tumorigenic niche to early NSCLC cells Nature. 2021; 595 :578-584 Google Scholar ). In murine PyMT BC, MHCII + CD11b + MRC1 + TRMs present in healthy MGs persist in developing breast tumors despite dilution by incoming monocyte-derived TAMs ( Franklin et al., 2014 32. Franklin, R.A. ∙ Liao, W. ∙ Sarkar, A. ... The cellular and molecular origin of tumor-associated macrophages Science. 2014; 344 :921-925 Google Scholar ). TRM depletion in vivo prior to carcinogenesis did not affect T cell activation nor tumor growth in autochthonous BC models ( Franklin et al., 2014 32. Franklin, R.A. ∙ Liao, W. ∙ Sarkar, A. ... The cellular and molecular origin of tumor-associated macrophages Science. 2014; 344 :921-925 Google Scholar ; Linde et al., 2018 50. Linde, N. ∙ Casanova-Acebes, M. ∙ Sosa, M.S. ... Macrophages orchestrate breast cancer early dissemination and metastasis Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :21 Google Scholar ) but increased early cancer cell dissemination ( Linde et al., 2018 50. Linde, N. ∙ Casanova-Acebes, M. ∙ Sosa, M.S. ... Macrophages orchestrate breast cancer early dissemination and metastasis Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :21 Google Scholar ). FOLR2 + macrophages resemble MRC1 + TRMs described by Franklin et al. (2014) 32. Franklin, R.A. ∙ Liao, W. ∙ Sarkar, A. ... The cellular and molecular origin of tumor-associated macrophages Science. 2014; 344 :921-925 Google Scholar . We did not evidence any T cell inhibitory activity by FOLR2 + macrophages. Instead, we show that FOLR2 + TRMs acquire the ability to prime naive CD8 + T cells into polyfunctional effectors (Granzyme B + , IFN-γ + , TNF-α + ) upon activation associated to tumor development.
FOLR2 + macrophages present a transcriptional signature of steady-state PV macrophages ( LYVE1 , MRC1 , and TIMD4 ). Accordingly, we found that some FOLR2 + macrophages were located in close proximity to CD31 + vessels in human tissues. In mice, various studies have identified PV macrophages across organs ( Chakarov et al., 2019 16. Chakarov, S. ∙ Lim, H.Y. ∙ Tan, L. ...

Early fate defines microglia and non-parenchymal brain macrophage development Cell. 2020; 181 :557-573.e18 Google Scholar ). In mouse models, a protumoral subset of PV macrophages expressing the angiopoietin receptor TIE2 has been implicated in angiogenesis and tumor spreading ( De Palma et al., 2005 24. De Palma, M. ∙ Venneri, M.A. ∙ Galli, R. ... Tie2 identifies a hematopoietic lineage of proangiogenic monocytes required for tumor vessel formation and a mesenchymal population of pericyte progenitors Cancer Cell. 2005; 8 :211-226 Google Scholar ; Lewis et al., 2016 44. Lewis, C.E. ∙ Harney, A.S. ∙ Pollard, J.W. The multifaceted role of perivascular macrophages in tumors Cancer Cell. 2016; 30 :18-25 Google Scholar ). However, we do not favor the hypothesis according to which FOLR2 + macrophages correspond to TIE2 + macrophages for two reasons: (1) we did not find TIE2 expression in FOLR2 + macrophages and (2) TIE2 + PV macrophages differentiate from inflammatory proangiogenic TIE2 + monocytes ( Coffelt et al., 2010 19. Coffelt, S.B. ∙ Tal, A.O. ∙ Scholz, A. ... Angiopoietin-2 regulates gene expression in TIE2-expressing monocytes and augments their inherent proangiogenic functions Cancer Res. 2010; 70 :5270-5280 Google Scholar ; Arwert et al., 2018 4. Arwert, E.N. ∙ Harney, A.S. ∙ Entenberg, D. ... A unidirectional transition from migratory to perivascular macrophage is required for tumor cell intravasation Cell Rep. 2018; 23 :1239-1248 Google Scholar ).
A recent study has identified a subset of potentially immunosuppressive FOLR2 + TAMs associated to human hepatocellular carcinoma ( Sharma et al., 2020 71. Sharma, A. ∙ Seow, J.J.W. ∙ Dutertre, C.-A. ... Onco-fetal reprogramming of endothelial cells drives immunosuppressive macrophages in hepatocellular carcinoma Cell. 2020; 183 :377-394.e21 Google Scholar ). To probe the function of FOLR2 + macrophages in large BC datasets, we designed a gene signature that enabled us to infer FOLR2 + macrophages abundance in BC bulk transcriptomes. We found that the abundance of FOLR2 + TAMs associated with better prognosis in patients with BC. We provide a validation of this finding by showing that the cellular density of FOLR2 + macrophages assessed by immunofluorescence positively correlates with increased BC patient survival. We next found that FOLR2 + —but not TREM2 + —macrophage abundance positively correlates with tumor-infiltrating CD8 + T cell, B cells, and DCs. In addition, we found by confocal imaging that FOLR2 + macrophages colocalized with CD8 + T cell aggregates in the vicinity of endothelial cells. We validated the correlation between FOLR2 + macrophage and CD8 + T cell abundance by multispectral imaging: tumor lesions highly infiltrated with FOLR2 + TAMs display significantly higher CD8 + T cell density. Using live imaging on fresh human tumor sections, we showed that tumor-infiltrating CD8 + T cells engage in long-lasting interactions with FOLR2 + TAMs. Since CD8 + T cell infiltration correlates with better survival probability in many cancers including BC, these results suggest that FOLR2 + TAMs participate to the onset of antitumor immunity. Further studies are needed to identify the mechanisms by which FOLR2 + TAMs regulate lymphocyte infiltration in tumors, a key event for the development of efficient antitumor immune responses.
Tools enabling the in vivo specific deletion of FOLR2 + TAMs, without impacting other monocyte/macrophage subsets are required to address the specific contribution of FOLR2 + TAMs to tumor immunity. In addition, extension of the findings of this study beyond BC needs further thorough characterization of FOLR2 + TAMs in other cancer types. We found that patients with luminal BC receiving endocrine therapy alone and presenting high FOLR2 gene-signature score have a significantly improved survival. Moreover, we showed that the FOLR2 gene signature is a significant prognostic factor when adjusted by several reported prognostic features of BC. Further studies are required to thoroughly benchmark the FOLR2 gene signature against other available stratification methods and to address its utility in specific, clinically relevant patient subgroups. Given the pronounced correlation with CD8 + T cells and the well-established prognostic power of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and cytotoxic cells in BC, future studies should aim to distinguish whether FOLR2 + TAMs hold independent prognostic power from CD8 + T cells.

This study did not generate new unique reagents.
Primary tumors, tissues adjacent to the tumor (juxta-tumor), metastatic and non-metastatic tumor-draining lymph nodes were surgically resected from treatment-free luminal breast cancer patients at the Institut Curie Hospital (Paris, France), in accordance with institutional ethical guidelines and after informed consent of patient was obtained. The protocol was approved by the Ethical Committee of Institut Curie (“Comité de la Recherche Institutionel” CRI-0804-2015). Patients clinical and pathological information are summarized in Table S1 . Tumor metastasis in tumor draining lymph nodes were diagnosed by the pathology department of Institut Curie and further confirmed by measuring by flow cytometry the percentage of EPCAM + CD45 - cells among live cells.
FOLR2 and TREM2 immunohistochemistry were performed on tumor sections retrieved from the archive of the Pathology Unit, ASST Spedali Civili di Brescia (see Table S1 ).
Murine tumor cell lines were grown in a humidified atmosphere at 37°C in 5% CO2. Py8119 and Py230 cell lines (ATCC) were cultured in F12K media (ATCC), complemented with 10% FCS (Eurobio), 1% Pencillin/Streptomycin, 0,1% β-Mercaptoethanol (LifeTechnologies) and 0,1% Mito+ serum extender (Corning) for Py230 cells. 4T1 cells were a gift from Dr. Clotilde Thery (Institut Curie, Paris) and were cultured in RPMI 1640 GlutaMAX (Gibco) containing 10% FCS (Eurobio), 1% Pencillin/Streptomycin, 1mM Sodium Pyruvate and 10mM HEPES (Gibco).
Transgenic MMTV-PyMT mice in C57Bl/6 background ( Davie et al., 2007 22. Davie, S.A. ∙ Maglione, J.E. ∙ Manner, C.K. ... Effects of FVB/NJ and C57BL/6J strain backgrounds on mammary tumor phenotype in inducible nitric oxide synthase deficient mice Transgen. Res. 2007; 16 :193-201 Google Scholar ), OTI x Rag -/- mice and NOD-scid-IL2rγ -/- (NSG) mice were maintained in a specific pathogen-free animal facility in accordance with Institut Curie guidelines. Healthy C57BL/6J and BALB/c female mice were obtained from Charles River Laboratories, maintained in a non-barrier facility and included at 8-12 weeks of age for experimental procedures. Animal care and use for this study were performed in accordance with the recommendations of the European Community (2010/63/UE) for the care and use of laboratory animals. Experimental procedures were specifically approved by the ethics committee of the Institut Curie CEEA-IC #118 (Authorization APAFiS#31138-2021042219022400-v1 given by National Authority) in compliance with the international guidelines.
MMTV-PyMT transgenic mice develop mammary tumors in all mammary glands. Tumors were allowed to grow for 12 weeks (neoplasia) to 24 weeks (late carcinoma) before harvest.
For analysis of tissue-resident macrophages, inguinal LNs were removed on the right and left sides and healthy 4 th mammary gland fat-pad were harvested in 8-12 weeks old WT C57Bl/6, BALB/c or NSG mice or MMTV-PyMT littermate controls.
Patient samples were processed as previously described ( Núñez et al., 2020 61. Núñez, N.G. ∙ Tosello Boari, J. ∙ Ramos, R.N. ... Tumor invasion in draining lymph nodes is associated with Treg accumulation in breast cancer patients Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :3272 Google Scholar ). In brief, freshly resected human samples were cut into small fragments and digested with 0.1 mg/ml Liberase TL (Roche) and 0.1 mg/ml DNase (Roche) in CO2-independent medium (Gibco) containing 0,4 g/l of human albumin (Vialebex) for 30 min at 37°C. Single cell suspension of dissociated tissues was filtered on a 40μm cell strainer (BD Biosciences), washed with CO2-independent medium + 0.4 g/l of human albumin and resuspended in medium for cell counting.
Py230 (10 6 cells), Py8119 (10 6 cells), 4T1 (0,5x10 6 cells) suspended in 200μl of PBS 1X were injected sub-cutaneously in the 4 th mammary gland fat-pad of C57Bl/6 (Py230, Py8119) or BALB/c (4T1) mice. Tumors were allowed to grow during 30 days before harvest and analysis.
For macrophage subset analysis, mammary tumors from MMTV-PyMT transgenic mice or from WT mice orthotopically transplanted with mammary tumor cell lines (Py230, Py8119, 4T1) were cut into small pieces and enzymatically digested for 1h at 37°C in CO2-independent medium (Gibco) containing 150 μg/mL DNAse and 75 μg/mL Liberase TL (Roche). Healthy mammary glands from MMTV-PyMT littermate controls were digested following the same enzymatic digestion protocol for 20 minutes. After digestion, remaining tissue-pieces were mashed with a plunger and cell suspensions were filtered on a 40μm cell-strainer (BD Biosciences). For both healthy and malignant mammary glands tissue-suspension, red blood cells were lysed with homemade red blood lysis buffer (8,32mg/ml of NH4CL + 0,84mg/ml of NaHCo3 + 0,043mg/ml of EDTA in H2O) for 2 minutes at room temperature. Finally, cells were resuspended in cold FACS buffer (1x PBS containing 2mM EDTA (Invitrogen) and 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma)) for further analysis.
CD8 + T cells used for T cell assays were isolated from OTI x Rag -/- mice or WT C57Bl/6 mice. To this end, spleen and peripheral LNs were harvested, mashed through a 40μm cell strainer and washed in cold PBS before red blood cell lysis (2 minutes at room temperature). Cells were further washed in cold 1x PBS + 2mM EDTA + 0.5% BSA for further assays.
After tissue-dissociation, cells were incubated with primary antibodies for 30 minutes at 4°C, washed twice and resuspended in FACS buffer (1x PBS containing 2mM EDTA (Invitrogen) and 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma)). Fc receptors were blocked with the anti-mouse CD16/CD32 (clone 2.4.G2) mAb (BD) for murine cells or with FcR blocking reagent (Miltenyi) for human cells. For CADM1 staining, cells were washed after the primary staining and incubated with a secondary antibody for an additional 30 minutes at 4°C, washed twice and resuspended in FACS buffer. Live/dead cell discrimination was performed by extemporaneous DAPI staining (working concentration 0,01μg/ml, Invitrogen). Cells were sorted using BD FACS-ARIA III flow cytometer (BD Biosciences).
Murine macrophages were sorted as Lineage(CD3/CD19/NKP46/B220/Ly6G) - Ly6C - F4/80 + CD64 + Folr2 + or Lineage(CD3/CD19/NKP46/B220/Ly6G) - Ly6C - F4/80 + CD64 + Folr2 - Cadm1 +
Human macrophages were sorted as CD45 + Lineage(CD3/CD19/CD56/CD1c) - CD11c + HLA-DR + XCR1 - CD14 + CCR2 - CD64 + CADM1 - FOLR2 + or CD45 + Lineage(CD3/CD19/CD56/CD1c) - CD11c + HLA-DR + XCR1 - CD14 + CCR2 - CD64 + CADM1 + FOLR2 - . Human monocytes were sorted as Lineage(CD3/CD19/CD56/CD1c) - CD11c + HLA-DR + XCR1 - CD14 + CCR2 + .
Flat bottom 96 well culture plate were coated with 10μg/ml of anti-CD3e (BD Bioscience) diluted in 1X PBS overnight at 4°C or 2h at 37°C. Plate was washed once with 1X PBS.
CD8 + T cells from spleens and LNs of C57BL/6 WT mice were harvested and purified using the CD8a + T Cell Isolation Kit, (130-104-075, Miltenyi) after red blood cell lysis. For proliferation assay, purified CD8 + T cells were labeled with 2μM of carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE, Invitrogen) at 37° C for 8 minutes.
Lineage(CD3/CD19/NKP46/B220/Ly6G) - Ly6C - F4/80 + CD64 + FOLR2 + or Lineage (CD3/CD19/NKP46/B220/Ly6G) - Ly6C - F4/80 + CD64 + CADM1 + macrophages were isolated by FACs-sorting from mammary tumors of 22-24 weeks old PyMT mice or age-matched littermate controls ( Figure S7 A).
50,000 macrophages were plated in 100μl/well in the anti-CD3-coated 96w-plate in complete RPMI medium (10% FCS + 1% Pencillin/Streptomycin + 1mM Sodium Pyruvate and 10mM HEPES). Anti-CD28 (1μg/ml final concentration, BD Bioscience) was added to the CFSE labelled T cells before plating at a ratio of 1 T cell for 2 macrophages. In some instance recombinant TGFβ (100ng/ml, Peprotech) was added to the culture.
after 3 days of co-culture, T cells were stained for CD44, CD25, CD62L, PD-1 to analyze their activation status. CFSE dilution was analyzed to assess T cell proliferation.
OTI CD8 + T cells from spleens and lymph nodes of OTI x Rag1 -/- mice were labeled for proliferation assay with 2μM of CellTrace Violet (CTV, Invitrogen) at 37°C for 20 minutes, washed and counted before culture with macrophages.
Lineage (CD3/CD19/NKP46/B220/Ly6G)-Ly6C - F4/80 + CD64 + FOLR2 + or Lineage (CD3/CD19/NKP46/B220/Ly6G)-Ly6C - F4/80 + CD64 + CADM1 + macrophages were isolated by FACs-sorting from healthy mammary glands or mammary tumors of 22-24 weeks old PyMT mice or age-matched littermate controls.
25,000 macrophages were plated in flat-bottom 96 well plates and incubated with various doses of the SIINFEKL OVA peptide (0,1 to 100nM) in complete RPMI medium (10% FCS + 1% Pencillin/Streptomycin + 1mM Sodium Pyruvate and 10mM HEPES) for 45 minutes at 37°C. After 2 washes, 25,000 CTV labeled OTI CD8 + T cells were added on top of the SIINFEKL pulsed macrophages at a 1:1 ratio.
after 3 days of co-culture, T cells were stained for CD8, CD44, CD25, CD62L, PD-1 to analyze their activation status. CTV dilution was analyzed to assess T cell proliferation. For intracellular cytokine detection, T cells were first stained for cell surface CD8 expression, 30 minutes at 4°C, washed in complete RPMI medium and incubated for 4 hours at 37°C with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (20 ng/ml; Sigma-Aldrich), 1 μM ionomycin (Sigma-Aldrich), and BD GolgiPlug in complete RPMI. After washing, re-stimulated T cells were stained for CD8 prior fixation with BD PermFix buffer for 20 minutes. Intracellular staining for GZMB, IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-2 was performed in BD PermWash buffer for 30 minutes.
For mass cytometry, pre-conjugated or purified antibodies were obtained from Invitrogen, Fluidigm (pre-conjugated antibodies), Biolegend, eBioscience, Becton Dickinson or R&D Systems. For some markers, fluorophore-conjugated or biotin-conjugated antibodies were used as primary antibodies, followed by secondary labeling with anti-fluorophore metal-conjugated antibodies (such as the anti-FITC clone FIT 22) or metal-conjugated streptavidin, produced as previously described ( Becher et al., 2014 6. Becher, B. ∙ Schlitzer, A. ∙ Chen, J. ... High-dimensional analysis of the murine myeloid cell system Nat. Immunol. 2014; 15 :1181-1189 Google Scholar ). Briefly, patient lymph nodes cell suspension (around 30x10 6 cells/well in a U-bottom 96 well plate; BD Falcon, Cat# 3077) were washed once with 200 mL FACS buffer (4% FBS, 2mM EDTA, 0.05% Azide in 1X PBS), then stained with 100 mL 200 mM cisplatin (SigmaAldrich, Cat# 479306-1G) for 5 min on ice to exclude dead cells. Cells were then washed with FACS buffer and once with PBS before fixing with 200 mL 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA; Electron Microscopy Sciences, Cat# 15710) in PBS overnight or longer. Following fixation, the cells were pelleted and resuspended in 200μL 1X permeabilization buffer (Biolegend, Cat# 421002) for 5 min at room temperature to enable intracellular labeling. Bromoacetamidobenzyl-EDTA (BABE)-linked metal barcodes were prepared by dissolving BABE (Dojindo, Cat# B437) in 100mM HEPES buffer (GIBCO, Cat# 15630) to a final concentration of 2 mM. Isotopically-purified PdCl2 (Trace Sciences) was then added to the 2 mM BABE solution to a final concentration of 0.5 mM. Similarly, DOTA-maleimide (DM)-linked metal barcodes were prepared by dissolving DM (Macrocyclics, Cat# B-272) in L buffer (MAXPAR, Cat# PN00008) to a final concentration of 1 mM. RhCl3 (Sigma) and isotopically-purified LnCl3 was then added to the DM solution at a final concentration of 0.5 mM. Six metal barcodes were used: BABE-Pd-102, BABE-Pd-104, BABE-Pd-106, BABE-Pd-108, BABE-Pd-110 and DMLn-113. All BABE and DM-metal solution mixtures were immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80C. A unique dual combination of barcodes was chosen to stain each tissue sample. Barcode Pd-102 was used at a 1:4000 dilution, Pd-104 at a 1:2000, Pd-106 and Pd-108 at a 1:1000, and Pd-110 and Ln-113 at a 1:500. Cells were incubated with 100 mL barcode in PBS for 30 min on ice, washed in permeabilization buffer and then incubated in FACS buffer for 10 min on ice. Cells were then pelleted and resuspended in 100 mL nucleic acid Ir-Intercalator (MAXPAR, Cat# 201192B) in 2% PFA/PBS (1:2000), at room temperature. After 20 min, cells were washed twice with FACS buffer and twice with water before being resuspended in water. In each set, the cells were pooled from all tissue types, counted, and diluted to 0.5x106 cells/mL. EQ Four Element Calibration Beads (DVS Science, Fluidigm) were added at a 1% concentration prior to acquisition.
After tissue processing, dissociation and cell counting, cell suspensions were maintained on ice and stained for FACS-sorting with DAPI and fluorophore-conjugated antibodies: Lineage (CD3, CD19, NKP46, B220, Ly6G) and CD45. CD45 + Lineage- cells were sorted with a FACS-ARIA III (BD) and collected in cold 1x PBS containing 0.04% of BSA for cell counting. The concentration of single cell suspensions was adjusted to 600 cells/μl. Approximately 6,000 to 10,000 sorted cells were loaded in a 10x Genomics Chromium chip.
After tissue processing, dissociation and cell counting, cell suspensions were maintained on ice and stained for FACS-sorting with DAPI and fluorophore-conjugated antibodies (see key resources table ). Cells were isolated using FACS-ARIA III (BD) cell sorter according to the gating strategies shown in Figure S2 D and collected in cold 1x PBS containing 0.04% of BSA for cell counting. PBMC were obtained from fresh blood samples by density gradient centrifugation using Lymphoprep (Stemcell Technologies) according to the manufacturer instructions, then washed and resuspended in CO2-independent medium + 0.4 g/l of human albumin prior FACS-sorting. Patients samples were processed within 1 hour after tumor resection. The concentration of single cell suspensions was adjusted to 300 cells/μl, and 3,000 to 5,000 sorted cells were loaded in a 10x Genomics Chromium chip within 6 hours.
Human and mouse cellular suspensions were loaded on a 10x Chromium Controller (10X Genomics) according to manufacturer’s protocol based on the 10x GEMCode proprietary technology. Single-cell RNA-Seq libraries were prepared using Chromium Single Cell 3′ v2 or v3 Reagent Kit (10x Genomics) according to manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, the initial step consisted in performing an emulsion where individual cells were isolated into droplets together with gel beads coated with unique primers bearing 10X cell barcodes, unique molecular identifiers (UMI), and poly(dT) sequences. Reverse transcription reactions were engaged to generate barcoded full-length cDNA followed by the disruption of emulsions using the recovery agent and cDNA clean up with DynaBeads MyOne Silane. Bulk cDNA was amplified using a GeneAmp PCR System 9700 with 96-Well Gold Sample Block Module (Applied Biosystems) (98 °C for 3 min; cycled 11/12 ×: 98 °C for 15 s, 63 °C for 20 s and 72 °C for 1 min; held at 4 °C). Amplified cDNA product was cleaned up with the SPRI select Reagent Kit (Beckman Coulter). Indexed sequencing libraries were constructed using the reagents from the Chromium Single Cell 3′ v3 Reagent Kit, following these steps: (1) fragmentation, end repair, and a-tailing; (2) size selection with SPRI select; (3) adaptor ligation; (4) post ligation cleanup with SPRI select; (5) sample index PCR and cleanup with SPRI select beads. Library quantification and quality assessment was performed using Qubit fluorometric assay (Invitrogen) with dsDNA HS (High Sensitivity) Assay Kit and Bioanalyzer Agilent 2100 using a High Sensitivity DNA chip (Agilent). Indexed libraries were pooled according to number of cells and sequenced on a NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina) using paired-end 28 × 91 bp. A depth around 50,000 reads per cell was obtained.
After tissue processing and cell count, cell suspensions were washed in cold FACS buffer (PBS + 0.5% BSA + 2mM EDTA) and stained with fluorophore conjugated antibodies and Fc-receptors blocking (Miltenyi) for 30 minutes at 4°C. Myeloid cell subsets were isolated using FACS-ARIA III (BD) cell sorter and directly collected on lysing TCL buffer (QIAGEN) containing 1% of beta-mercaptoethanol before storage at -80°C. RNA were extracted and isolated using the Single Cell RNA purification kit (Norgen, Cat#51800) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After extraction, total RNA was analyzed using Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer System. RNA quality was estimated based on capillary electrophoresis profiles using the RNA Integrity Number (RIN). RNA sequencing libraries were prepared using the SMARTer Stranded Total RNA-Seq Kit v2 - Pico Input Mammalian (Clontech/Takara). The input quantity of total RNA was comprised between 1 and 22ng. This protocol includes a first step of RNA fragmentation, using a proprietary fragmentation mix at 94°C. The time of incubation was set up for each sample, based on the RNA quality, and according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. After fragmentation, indexed cDNA synthesis was performed. Then the ribodepletion step was performed, using probes specific to mammalian rRNA. PCR amplification was finally achieved to amplify the indexed cDNA libraries, with a number of cycles set up according to the input quantity of tRNA. Library quantification and quality assessment was performed using Qubit fluorometric assay (Invitrogen) with dsDNA HS (High Sensitivity) Assay Kit and LabChip GX Touch using a High Sensitivity DNA chip (Perkin Elmer). Libraries were then equimolarly pooled and quantified by qPCR using the KAPA library quantification kit (Roche). Sequencing was carried out on the NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina), targeting between 10 and 15M reads per sample and using paired-end 2 x 100 bp.
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks were cut with a microtome into fine slivers of 3 microns. Immunohistochemistry was processed in a Bond RX automated (Leica) with Bond Polymer refine detection kit (Leica, DS9800). Antigen retrieval was performed in BOND Epitope Retrieval Solution 1 (Leica, AR9961). Primary antibody APOE (Abcam; ab52607) was incubated 30 minutes at room temperature. Slides were counterstained with hematoxylin before mounting with resin. Images were acquired by using Digital Pathology slide scanner (Ultra Fast Scanner 1.8, Philips)
FOLR2 expression was tested on human tissues by using immunohistochemistry. Sample included reactive lymph nodes (n=7), primary carcinomas (n=47), metastatic tumor draining lymph nodes (n=7) and distant metastasis to lung (n=8) and liver (n=11) from different primary site (breast, bladder, gastro-intestinal, lung, kidney and skin) ( Table S1 ) retrieved from the archive of the Pathology Unit, ASST Spedali Civili di Brescia. Briefly, anti-FOLR2 (clone OTI4G6, 1:100, Thermo Fisher SCIENTIFIC) and anti-TREM2 (clone D814C, 1:100, Cell Signaling Technology) antibodies were revealed using Novolink Polymer (Leica) followed by DAB. For double staining, FOLR2 was combined with anti-CD3 (clone LN10, 1:70, Leica Biosystem), anti-CD20 (clone L26, 1:200, Leica Biosystem), anti-CD31 (clone PECAM-1, 1:50, Leica) and anti-TREM2. Briefly, after completing the first immune reaction, the second immune reaction was visualized using Mach 4 MR-AP (Biocare Medical), followed by Ferangi Blue. Localization of FOLR2 + cells within TLS was confirmed by double for the B-cell marker CD20 and the T-cell marker CD3.
Biopsies were fixed overnight at 4°C in a Periodate-Lysine-Paraformaldehyde solution (0.05 M phosphate buffer containing 0.1 M L-lysine [pH 7.4], 2 mg/ml NaIO4, and 10 mg/ml paraformaldehyde). Fixed tumors were then embedded in 5% low-gelling-temperature agarose (type VII-A, Sigma-Aldrich) and cut into 400 μm-thick slices as previously described ( Peranzoni et al., 2018 63. Peranzoni, E. ∙ Lemoine, J. ∙ Vimeux, L. ... Macrophages impede CD8 T cells from reaching tumor cells and limit the efficacy of anti-PD-1 treatment Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115 :E4041-E4050 Google Scholar ). Tumor slices were stained for 15 minutes at 37°C with fluorophore conjugated antibodies (see key resources table ). All antibodies were diluted in 1x PBS and used at a concentration of 5 μg/ml, except anti-FOLR2 and anti-CD31 antibodies that were used at 10 μg/ml. Z-stack images of 5x5 fields were taken with a 10x water immersion objective (10x/0.3 N.A.) on an inverted spinning disk confocal microscope (IXplore, Olympus). Virtual slices were reconstituted and analyzed with the ImageJ software.
To evaluate resident CD8 + T cell migration, tumor slices were prepared following the protocol described previously ( Peranzoni et al., 2018 63. Peranzoni, E. ∙ Lemoine, J. ∙ Vimeux, L. ... Macrophages impede CD8 T cells from reaching tumor cells and limit the efficacy of anti-PD-1 treatment Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115 :E4041-E4050 Google Scholar ). Briefly, samples were embedded in 5% low-gelling-temperature agarose (type VII-A; Sigma-Aldrich) prepared in 1x PBS. Slices (400 μm) were cut with a vibratome (VT 1000S; Leica) in a bath of ice-cold PBS. Slices were transferred to 0.4-μm organotypic culture inserts (merck millipore Cat# PICM03050) in 35-mm Petri dishes containing 1 ml RPMI 1640 without Phenol Red. Live vibratome sections were stained with the following antibodies: BV421-anti-human EpCAM (9C4 clone; BioLegend), PerCP-Cy5.5-anti-human- CD8a (SK1 clone; BioLegend) and APC-anti-human FOLR2 (94b clone; BioLegend) at 10 μg/mL in RPMI 1640 without Phenol Red supplemented with 3% of huma serum. T cells were imaged with a DM500B upright microscope equipped with an upright spinning disk confocal microscope (Leica) with a 37°C thermostatic chamber. For dynamic imaging, tumor slices were secured with a stainless-steel slice anchor (Warner Instruments) and perfused at a rate of 0.3 mL/min with a solution of RPMI without Phenol Red, bubbled with 95% O 2 and 5% CO 2 . Images from a first microscopic field were acquired with a 25× water immersion objective (20×/0.95 N.A.; Olympus). For four-dimensional analysis of cell migration, stacks of 6–10 sections (z step = 8 μm) were acquired every 20 s for 20 min at depths up to 80 m. Regions were selected for imaging when tumor parenchyma, stroma, FOLR2 + macrophages, and CD8 + T cells were simultaneously present in the same microscopic field. Between two and four microscopic fields were selected for each tumor samples for time-lapse experiments.
After tissue processing and cell counting, cell suspensions (around 2x10 6 human cells or 5x10 6 murine cells) were stained with Live/Dead Fixable Aqua Dead Cell Stain Kit (Life Technologies) in PBS for 10 minutes at room temperature. Cells were then washed in 1x PBS + 2mM EDTA + 0.5% BSA and stained with fluorophore-conjugated antibodies in the presence of Fc-receptors blocking reagent during 30 minutes at 4°C. When needed, cell suspensions were subsequently washed with FACs buffer and submitted to intracellular staining (1 hour at 4°C) using fixation/permeabilization kit (eBiosciences for human cells or BD Biosciences for murine cells) according to the manufacturer instructions. Data acquisition was performed using an LSR-Fortessa (BD), compensation and analysis were done using FlowJo software (TreeStar).
Cell data were acquired and analyzed using a CyTOF Mass cytometer (Fluidigm). The CyTOF data were exported in a conventional flow-cytometry file (.fcs) format and normalized using previously-described software ( Finck et al., 2013 31. Finck, R. ∙ Simonds, E.F. ∙ Jager, A. ... Normalization of mass cytometry data with bead standards Cytometry A. 2013; 83 :483-494 Google Scholar ). Events with zero values were randomly assigned a value between 0 and –1 using a custom R script employed in a previous version of the mass cytometry software ( Newell et al., 2012 60. Newell, E.W. ∙ Sigal, N. ∙ Bendall, S.C. ... Cytometry by time-of-flight shows combinatorial cytokine expression and virus-specific cell niches within a continuum of CD8 + T cell phenotypes Immunity. 2012; 36 :142-152 Google Scholar ). Cells for each barcode were deconvolved using the Boolean gating algorithm within FlowJo. The CD45 + Lineage (CD3/CD19/CD20) - HLA-DR +/- CD14+ population of lymph nodes were gated using FlowJo, exported as a.fcs file and uploaded into R studio (R software environment, version R4) using “flowCore” packages. To obtain an unbiased overview, we systematically reduced the flow cytometry data to two dimensions by applying uniform manifold approximation (UMAP, R package “umap”). All cells were clustered using the FlowSOM algorithm (R package “FlowSOM”) ( Van Gassen et al., 2015 76. Van Gassen, S. ∙ Callebaut, B. ∙ Van Helden, M.J. ... FlowSOM: using self-organizing maps for visualization and interpretation of cytometry data Cytometry A. 2015; 87 :636-645 Google Scholar ) in conjunction with consensus clustering (R package “ConsensusClusterPlus”) and subsequently manually annotated accordingly to Brummelman et al. (2019) 11. Brummelman, J. ∙ Haftmann, C. ∙ Núñez, N.G. ... Development, application and computational analysis of high-dimensional fluorescent antibody panels for single-cell flow cytometry Nat. Protoc. 2019; 14 :1946-1969 Google Scholar .
Human and mouse raw sequencing data were respectively aligned on reference genome GRCh38/84 and GRCm38/84 (genome assembly/ENSEMBL release) using 10X software CellRanger (Version 3.0.2) with default parameters. Gene expression counts for individual cells were generated using cellranger count.
For both human and mouse raw count matrix, we kept cells expressing at least 200 genes. Cells with mitochondrial content greater than 10 to 20 % were removed. After this quality control, data were normalized by total counts following the Seurat 3 R pipeline ( Butler et al., 2018 12. Butler, A. ∙ Hoffman, P. ∙ Smibert, P. ... Integrating single-cell transcriptomic data across different conditions, technologies, and species Nat. Biotechnol. 2018; 36 :411-420 Google Scholar ). Cells identified as contaminant of the gating strategy (T/B/NK cells, LAMP3 + DCs e.g. ) or cells with high heat-shock-protein or ribosomal coding genes content in which no myeloid cell identifying gene could be detected, were filtered out.
For sample merging we applied a VST (Variance Stabilizing Transformation) method selecting for the most variable genes. We performed the Seurat V3 integration pipeline using the most 8000 genes for the ten human samples. The 3000 most variable genes were used to merge the two mice samples. For both anchors selection and integration steps we used the default parameters of Seurat V3 functions.
Data were scaled by applying a regression using as variation factors, the total UMI counts, the percent of expressed mitochondrial genes, the origin sample and tissue of each cell and the version of CellRanger chemistry kit used for sequencing. Heatmaps are showing z-scores of this scaled matrix. The UMAP visualization was built using respectively the 50 and 30 most informative components of the PCA for Human and Mouse.
The clustering was processed by constructing a Shared Nearest Neighbor (SNN) Graph. The 20 neighbors of each cell were first determined. The resulting KNN graph was used to construct the SNN graph by calculating the neighborhood overlap (Jaccard index) between every cell and its 20 nearest neighbors. Clustering was then applied on this graph using the Louvain graph-based algorithm. Differential gene expression analysis was applied on each sample log normalized matrix. We used the Seurat function FindAllMarkers() , with a Logistic Regression test, and adding as variation factors, the origin sample and tissue of each cell and the version of CellRanger sequencing kit used. Only genes expressed in more than 10% of the cells in a cluster and having at least 0.10 of log Fold-Change between compared groups were tested. We were able to detect low signals produced by genes with dropouts. For the volcano plots only the first condition was kept. At the end, only genes with a significative adjusted p-value (pv<0.05, false discovery rate (FDR) adjusted p-value) were kept and used to define each cluster.
To compare mouse and human macrophages, we selected conserved orthologue genes between both species. Corresponding gene symbols table was provided by the Mouse Genome Informatics database ( Table S3 ). For genes with more than one corresponding orthologue in the other species, we took the mean expression of all orthologues. Seurat label transfer scoring algorithm was applied from mouse (as query) to human dataset (as reference) ( Stuart et al., 2019 72. Stuart, T. ∙ Butler, A. ∙ Hoffman, P. ... Comprehensive integration of single-cell data Cell. 2019; 177 :1888-1902.e21 Google Scholar ). For the anchors searching step, we used the 10 000 most variable genes of the reference dataset. The following steps of the Seurat pipeline was applied with default parameters.
We downloaded the dataset of Azizi et al. (2018) 5. Azizi, E. ∙ Carr, A.J. ∙ Plitas, G. ... Single-cell map of diverse immune phenotypes in the breast tumor microenvironment Cell. 2018; 174 :1293-1308.e36 Google Scholar (GSE114725). We used the classical pipeline for single cell analysis of Seurat V3 (without integration correction) from the raw count matrix (supplementary file GSE114725_rna_raw.csv.gz). We next perform Louvain graph-based clustering. At the resolution 0.9 we obtained 39 clusters: 14 clusters of T cells, 6 clusters of B cells, 5 clusters of NK cells, 1 cluster of pDCs, DC1, DC2, CD16 + monocytes, CD14 + monocytes, neutrophils or mast cells, 3 clusters of macrophages and 4 clusters of contaminating cells. We merged clusters of the same immune cell types ( Figure 4 B). We downloaded the dataset of Han et al. (2018) 38. Han, X. ∙ Wang, R. ∙ Zhou, Y. ... Mapping the mouse cell atlas by microwell-seq Cell. 2018; 172 :1091-1107.e17 Google Scholar (GSE108097). We integrated 2 samples of virgin mammary gland and 1 sample of pregnant mammary gland from the raw data (supplementary file GSE108097_RAW.tar). We used the same pipeline described above including the integration step. Figure S3 D shows clustering at the resolution 0.1.
The raw sequencing data was initially aligned on the human reference genome hg19 or the murine reference genome mm10, using STAR aligner (v2.5.3a) ( Dobin et al., 2013 26. Dobin, A. ∙ Davis, C.A. ∙ Schlesinger, F. ... STAR: ultrafast universal RNA-seq aligner Bioinformatics. 2013; 29 :15-21 Google Scholar ). Raw read counts matrix was made with STAR (using the parameter --quantMode GeneCounts). FastQ files quality control were applied with FastQC (removing of adapters and low-quality bases). Non-expressed genes (the sum of counts in all samples less than 2) and lowly expressed genes (background; log 2 of the average of raw counts in all samples less than 2) were removed from the raw read count matrix. For differential expression analysis, we used the R package DESeq2 (version 1.24.0) ( Love et al., 2014 51. Love, M.I. ∙ Huber, W. ∙ Anders, S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2 Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :550 Google Scholar ) with a p-value correction. The DESeq matrix was designed using the information of the patient and the cell type (following the formula design = ∼ batch + condition). For the normalization, we used the median of ratios method ( Anders and Huber, 2010 3. Anders, S. ∙ Huber, W. Differential expression analysis for sequence count data Genome Biol. 2010; 11 :R106 Google Scholar ) and the rlog transformation for visualization and clustering as proposed in the DESeq2 tutorial. We used ClueGO and Cytoscape for pathway annotation in Figures 6 C and 7 C ( Bindea et al., 2009 8. Bindea, G. ∙ Mlecnik, B. ∙ Hackl, H. ... ClueGO: a cytoscape plug-in to decipher functionally grouped gene ontology and pathway annotation networks Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :1091-1093 Google Scholar ).
A 3D image analysis was performed on x, y, and z planes using Imaris 7.4 (Oxford Instruments). Cellular motility parameters were then calculated. Tracks of >10% of the total recording time were included in the analysis. Tracks with high fluorescence intensity of FOLR2 in more than 3 time-points were assigned as« cells in contact ».
Paraffin-embedded tissue blocks from Institut Curie Hospital were cut with a microtome into fine slivers of 5 microns for subsequent analysis. Tissue microarrays (TMA) from breast cancer patients (TMA#1 n=122 spots; TMA#2 n=126 spots) were obtained commercially (AMSBIO, England). Immunostaining was processed in a Bond RX automated (Leica) with Opal™ 7-Color IHC Kits (Akoya Biosciences, NEL821001KT) according to the manufacturer’s instructions using antibodies (see key resources table ). Tissue sections were coverslipped with Prolong™ Diamond Antifade Mountant (Thermo Fisher) and stored at 4°C. Subsequently, slides were scanned using the Vectra® 3 automated quantitative pathology imaging system (Vectra 3.0.5; Akoya Biosciences). Multispectral images were unmixed and analyzed using the inForm Advanced Image Analysis Software (inForm 2.4.6; Akoya Biosciences) and the HALO software for immune subsets quantification.
METABRIC gene expression data ( Curtis et al., 2012 21. Curtis, C. ∙ Shah, S.P. ∙ Chin, S.F. ... The genomic and transcriptomic architecture of 2,000 breast tumours reveals novel subgroups Nature. 2012; 486 :346-352 Google Scholar ), as well as clinical and sample level metadata were downloaded from cBioPortal. We annotated patient breast cancer subtypes by the following definitions: Luminal A (ER or PR positive, HER2 negative), Luminal B (ER positive, PR negative, HER2 positive), HER2 (ER and PR negative, HER2 positive) and TNBC (ER, PR, HER2 negative). Patients that died of other causes not related to their disease, as well as patients with breast sarcomas were removed. TNBC expression data was submitted to the TNBC type ( Chen et al., 2012 17. Chen, X. ∙ Li, J. ∙ Gray, W.H. ... TNBCtype: a subtyping tool for triple-negative breast cancer Cancer Inform. 2012; 11 :147-156 Google Scholar ) algorithm that removed a further 6 patients from the TNBC cohort (MB-3297, MB-7269, MB-5008, MB-6052, MB-0179, MB-2993. The final cohort consisted of 1381 samples (250 TNBC, 114 HER2, 968 Luminal A and 49 Luminal B). To score individual samples for gene-signatures of interest, we Z-score normalised the gene expression data, and then calculated a mean level of expression across signature genes. To define the optimal cut-off by which to stratify patients into high and low groups according to the FOLR2 gene-signature and macrophage gene-signature expression, we fit univariate CoxPH models for the signature using cut-off values between 0.2 and 0.8 with increments of 0.02. The optimal cut-off was defined as that with the lowest Wald test P value. We carried out survival analysis using the survival (3.1-12) and survminer (0.4.6) packages in R. To obtain the PAM50 subtype of patients we harnessed the R package genefu (2.22.1) ( Gendoo et al., 2016 34. Gendoo, D.M.A. ∙ Ratanasirigulchai, N. ∙ Schröder, M.S. ... Genefu: an R/Bioconductor package for computation of gene expression-based signatures in breast cancer Bioinformatics. 2016; 32 :1097-1099 Google Scholar ) and the function molecular.subtyping . We computed pairwise Spearman correlations between signatures of interest and plotted these as a correlation heatmap using the corrplot R package (0.84). The MCP counter algorithm was used to infer immune cell abundance ( Becht et al., 2016 7. Becht, E. ∙ Giraldo, N.A. ∙ Lacroix, L. ... Estimating the population abundance of tissue-infiltrating immune and stromal cell populations using gene expression Genome Biol. 2016; 17 :218 Google Scholar ). Correlations that were statistically non-significant (p<0.05) were marked with a dash (-). We used ggplot2 (3.3.0) and ComplexHeatmap (2.7.6.1003) for plotting data ( Gu et al., 2016 36. Gu, Z. ∙ Eils, R. ∙ Schlesner, M. Complex heatmaps reveal patterns and correlations in multidimensional genomic data Bioinformatics. 2016; 32 :2847-2849 Google Scholar ).
Data used in this publication were generated by the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (NCI/NIH). Log-ratio normalized proteomic data including clinical information and RNA sequencing data from the CPTAC BRCA study were downloaded ( http://linkedomics.org/data_download/TCGA-BRCA/ ). BRCA patient samples annotated as either ER or PR positive, and HER2 negative, were selected for downstream analysis. Patients were then stratified according to a 25% cut-off by FOLR2 protein expression and univariate Cox regression analysis was carried out. Logrank test scores were plotted on Kaplan-Meier plots.
Breast stroma microarray gene expression data ( Finak et al., 2008 30. Finak, G. ∙ Bertos, N. ∙ Pepin, F. ... Stromal gene expression predicts clinical outcome in breast cancer Nat. Med. 2008; 14 :518-527 Google Scholar ) was downloaded from the GEO database under accession GSE9014. For genes with multiple mapped probes, the probe with the highest variance was selected. Signature score were computed as in other datasets, and for samples with duplicates the mean value was taken as the final per-patient signature score. Wilcoxon tests were used to compare patients with poor (increased rate of recurrence and shorter relapse-free survival) versus mixed/ good outcome. Gene expression data from the Wang dataset (Wang et al., 2005b) was downloaded from GEO (GSE2034). Again, in instances where multiple probes mapped to the same gene, the probe with the highest variance was selected. Patients could only be stratified into ER positive and negative groups based on the clinical data provided. Signature scores were computed as above.
We downloaded transcriptomic data (files ending.uncv2.mRNAseq_RSEM_normalized_log2.txt) generated by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) from the Broad Institute portal ( http://gdac.broadinstitute.org ). Samples from tumor-adjacent, healthy tissue were excluded (TCGA barcode ID ending in 11 or 12). Pan-cancer overall survival, progression-free interval and immune biomarker data were obtained from the supplemental information (Supp1a.txt) of Thorsson et al. (2018) 74. Thorsson, V. ∙ Gibbs, D.L. ∙ Brown, S.D. ... The immune landscape of cancer Immunity. 2018; 48 :812-830.e14 Google Scholar . Melanomas were split into those from the primary tumour and those from metastatic samples. Gene-signatures were calculated as above. Univariate Cox regression models were fit for predictors of interest as continuous variables. Hazard ratios, 95% confidence intervals and Wald test P values were extracted from each model. For the TCGA BRCA study, subtyping was carried out as above. HER2 positivity was determined by IHC or by FISH assay status. Altogether, there were 45 HER2 patients, 675 Luminal A, 35 Luminal B and 180 TNBC. 328 were indeterminate due to a lack of data. Additional clinical data were obtained using the TCGAbiolinks R package (2.18.0).
To compare TREM2 and FOLR2 mRNA expression between non-disease healthy tissue, tumour-adjacent normal tissue, and tumour tissue, we harnessed datasets from GTEx and TCGA consortia. For breast, colon and lung studies, we downloaded normalised transcriptomic data from Github ( https://github.com/mskcc/RNAseqDB/tree/master/data/normalized ). We used non-parametric, Wilcoxon T tests to compare TREM2 and FOLR2 expression between tissue types. The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Project was supported by the Common Fund of the Office of the Director of the National Institutes of Health, and by NCI, NHGRI, NHLBI, NIDA, NIMH, and NINDS.
The tests used for statistical analyses are described in the legends of each concerned figure and have been performed using GraphPad Prism v8 or R v3.4. Symbols for significance: ns, non-significant; ∗ , <0.05, ∗∗ , <0.01; ∗∗∗ , <0.001; ∗∗∗∗ , <0.0001. Values were expressed as mean ± SEM or median of biological replicates, as specified.
