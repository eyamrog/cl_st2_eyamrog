Title: A Genome-wide ER-phagy Screen Highlights Key Roles of Mitochondrial Metabolism and ER-Resident UFMylation


Abstract: Summary

Selective autophagy of organelles is critical for cellular differentiation, homeostasis, and organismal health. Autophagy of the ER (ER-phagy) is implicated in human neuropathy but is poorly understood beyond a few autophagosomal receptors and remodelers. By using an ER-phagy reporter and genome-wide CRISPRi screening, we identified 200 high-confidence human ER-phagy factors. Two pathways were unexpectedly required for ER-phagy. First, reduced mitochondrial metabolism represses ER-phagy, which is opposite of general autophagy and is independent of AMPK. Second, ER-localized UFMylation is required for ER-phagy to repress the unfolded protein response via IRE1α. The UFL1 ligase is brought to the ER surface by DDRGK1 to UFMylate RPN1 and RPL26 and preferentially targets ER sheets for degradation, analogous to PINK1-Parkin regulation during mitophagy. Our data provide insight into the cellular logic of ER-phagy, reveal parallels between organelle autophagies, and provide an entry point to the relatively unexplored process of degrading the ER network.

Section: Introduction

Macroautophagy (herein referred to as autophagy) mediates the delivery of cellular cargo to the lysosome for degradation. Once thought to be a non-specific process, it has become clear that autophagy is complexly regulated and induced by various stresses to remove damaged or excessive cellular components. Targeted removal of entire organelles by autophagy is necessary for cellular homeostasis, and, during selective autophagy of mitochondria (mitophagy), the surface proteins of damaged mitochondria are marked by phosphorylation and ubiquitylation to recruit autophagic machinery ( Nguyen et al., 2016; Youle and Narendra, 2011 57.

Mechanisms of mitophagy Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 12 :9-14 Crossref Scopus (2482) PubMed Google Scholar ). Dysregulation of selective organelle autophagy negatively impacts cellular fitness and is linked to degenerative diseases, particularly in non-regenerative cell types such as neurons. For example, mutations of key mitophagy genes, such as PINK1 and Parkin, are strongly associated with disorders such as Parkinson’s disease ( Deas et al., 2011; Dodson and Guo, 2007; Geisler et al., 2010; Pickrell and Youle, 2015; Pilsl and Winklhofer, 2012 15.

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) plays a critical role in numerous cellular functions, such as the the storage of calcium, the biosynthesis of lipids, and the maturation and transport of secretory and membrane proteins ( Schwarz and Blower, 2016 70. Schwarz, D.S. ∙ Blower, M.D. The endoplasmic reticulum: structure, function and response to cellular signaling Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2016; 73 :79-94 Crossref Scopus (894) PubMed Google Scholar ). The ER is tightly regulated by multiple quality-control mechanisms, such as ER-associated degradation (ERAD) and ER to Lysosome Associated Degradation (ERLAD) ( Fregno et al., 2018; Ruggiano et al., 2014 21. Fregno, I. ∙ Fasana, E. ∙ Bergmann, T.J. ...

Cell Biol. 2014; 204 :869-879 Crossref Scopus (448) PubMed Google Scholar ). The ER-autophagy (ER-phagy) pathway intersects with the selective autophagy machinery to send portions of the ER for wholesale lysosomal degradation. While ER-phagy has long been observed in yeast ( Hamasaki et al., 2005 30. Hamasaki, M. ∙ Noda, T. ∙ Baba, M. ... Starvation triggers the delivery of the endoplasmic reticulum to the vacuole via autophagy in yeast Traffic. 2005; 6 :56-65 Crossref Scopus (148) PubMed Google Scholar ), it has only recently been described in mammalian cells ( Khaminets et al., 2015 39. Khaminets, A. ∙ Heinrich, T. ∙ Mari, M. ... Regulation of endoplasmic reticulum turnover by selective autophagy Nature. 2015; 522 :354-358 Crossref Scopus (636) PubMed Google Scholar ).
During ER-phagy, several ER surface proteins, including FAM134B, RTN3L, TEX264, and ATL3, act as specific receptors through LC3/GABARAP-interacting regions (LIRs/GIMs) to recruit autophagy machinery ( An et al., 2019; Chino et al., 2019; Grumati et al., 2017; Khaminets et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2019 4.

ER expansion can also be reversed via ER-phagy that is mediated by the SEC62 and CCPG1 LIR-containing ER-phagy receptors ( Fumagalli et al., 2016; Smith et al., 2018 23. Fumagalli, F. ∙ Noack, J. ∙ Bergmann, T.J. ... Translocon component Sec62 acts in endoplasmic reticulum turnover during stress recovery Nat.

The reticular ER network is remodeled for delivery to the lysosome by Atlastin GTPases that are also involved in basal ER morphology maintenance ( Liang et al., 2018; Rismanchi et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2016 48.

Cell Res. 2016; 349 :32-44 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ). But beyond the few receptors and remodelers most proximal to autophagosomal function, relatively little is known about the signals that regulate ER-phagy.
We performed a genome-wide CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) reporter-based screen to discover new players in ER-phagy, identifying both activators and inhibitors in a variety of cellular compartments. We deeply interrogated two pathways that positively regulate ER-phagy: (1) mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and (2) ER-resident UFMylation. While inhibition of OXPHOS reduces cellular energy levels and stimulates general autophagy, genetic or chemical inhibition of OXPHOS instead represses ER-phagy. Surprisingly, OXPHOS-dependent ER-phagy bypasses the canonical energy-sensing AMP-dependent protein kinase (AMPK). We furthermore found that UFMylation, a ubiquitin-like post-translational modification, is required for ER-phagy. The protein DDRGK1 recruits UFMylation machinery to the ER surface in a striking parallel to the mitophagic recruitment of Parkin by PINK1. DDRGK1 is specifically required for the ER-phagy of ER sheets, including ER-phagy mediated by LIR/GIM receptors located on these subdomains. Unbiased proteomics identified Ribophorin 1 (RPN1), an ER-localized quality control factor, as an ER sheet-localized target of DDRGK1-dependent UFMylation. Interfering with UFMylation-dependent ER-phagy leads to the accumulation of misfolded proteins and induces the unfolded protein response (UPR) via IRE1α signaling. Overall, our data provide a detailed map of ER-phagy regulators and highlight how organelle crosstalk and ER-resident factors mediate this emerging process of quality control.

Section: Results

To develop a genome-wide screen for ER-phagy, we employed the previously-developed ER-autophagy tandem reporter (EATR) system ( Figure 1 A) ( Liang et al., 2018 48. Liang, J.R. ∙ Lingeman, E. ∙ Ahmed, S. ... Atlastins remodel the endoplasmic reticulum for selective autophagy J. Cell Biol. 2018; 217 :3354-3367 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ). We first exposed HCT116 colon cancer cells stably expressing either the EATR construct or a general autophagy reporter (mCherry-eGFP-LC3B) to several stresses that could induce general autophagy and/or ER stress. Only prolonged amino acid starvation (16 h) using Earl’s buffered saline solution (EBSS) robustly induced both ER-phagy and general autophagy ( Figures S1 A–S1C). Torin1, which induces general autophagy via inactivation of mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes, triggered general autophagy but did not induce ER-phagy ( Figures S1 A–S1C) ( Thoreen et al., 2009 78. Thoreen, C.C. ∙ Kang, S.A. ∙ Chang, J.W. ... An ATP-competitive mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor reveals rapamycin-resistant functions of mTORC1 J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284 :8023-8032 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1467) PubMed Google Scholar ). Rapamycin, which partially inhibits mTORC1 but spares mTORC2, induced neither general autophagy nor ER-autophagy in HCT116 cells ( Figures S1 A–S1C) ( Jacinto et al., 2004; Thoreen and Sabatini, 2009 35. Jacinto, E. ∙ Loewith, R. ∙ Schmidt, A. ... Mammalian TOR complex 2 controls the actin cytoskeleton and is rapamycin insensitive Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6 :1122-1128 Crossref Scopus (1760) PubMed Google Scholar 77. Thoreen, C.C. ∙ Sabatini, D.M. Rapamycin inhibits mTORC1, but not completely Autophagy. 2009; 5 :725-726 Crossref Scopus (231) PubMed Google Scholar ). Direct activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) using tunicamycin or thapsigargin also failed to stimulate general autophagy or ER-phagy ( Figures S1 A–S1C). By quantifying the ratio of eGFP/mCherry reporter fluorescence, we found that EBSS starvation induces ER-phagy in up to 80% of cells, with an average of 8% of the ER present in an acidified compartment at any given time ( Figures S1 B and S1D).
Having established amino acid starvation (using EBSS) as a robust ER-phagy stimulus, we coupled EATR-based fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) screening with genome-wide CRISPR transcriptional inhibition (CRISPRi) to identify novel pathways involved in ER-phagy ( Figures 1 A and 1B) ( Gilbert et al., 2014; Horlbeck et al., 2016; Liang et al., 2018 26.

Since autophagy is influenced by the availability of cellular energy, we reasoned that complete knockout of ER-phagy regulators via CRISPR cutting could be detrimental to cells and mask interesting players. Indeed, mTOR is an essential gene and so cannot be queried using CRISPR screens beyond cell survival. The variability in single-guide RNA (sgRNA) efficiencies of CRISPRi leads to different knockdown efficiencies, allowing for allelic series and residual function of essential genes involved in cellular energy regulation ( Horlbeck et al., 2016 33. Horlbeck, M.A. ∙ Gilbert, L.A. ∙ Villalta, J.E. ... Compact and highly active next-generation libraries for CRISPR-mediated gene repression and activation eLife. 2016; 5 Published online September 23, 2016 Crossref Scopus (430) Google Scholar ).
As a proof of concept, we first assessed the suitability of EATR for CRISPRi screening by conducting a pilot screen with a custom CRISPRi library targeting known autophagy genes ( Table S1 ). We used EATR-based FACS to isolate the top 25% of cells with the most ER-phagy (“enhanced” sort gate), and the bottom 25% of cells with the least ER-phagy (“inhibited” sort gate) ( Figure S1 E). This pilot screen successfully identified sgRNAs targeting core autophagy genes as required for ER-phagy and correctly assigned their role in promoting ER-phagy such that knockdown of autophagy components was enriched in the inhibited gate ( Figure S1 F) and depleted in the enhanced sort gate ( Figure S1 G).
We scaled up to perform an unbiased, genome-wide CRISPRi-v2 screen for ER-phagy regulators using EATR-FACS ( Gilbert et al., 2014; Horlbeck et al., 2016 26. Gilbert, L.A. ∙ Horlbeck, M.A. ∙ Adamson, B. ... Genome-scale CRISPR-mediated control of gene repression and activation Cell. 2014; 159 :647-661 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1810) PubMed Google Scholar 33. Horlbeck, M.A. ∙ Gilbert, L.A. ∙ Villalta, J.E. ... Compact and highly active next-generation libraries for CRISPR-mediated gene repression and activation eLife. 2016; 5 Published online September 23, 2016 Crossref Scopus (430) Google Scholar ). We developed a very stringent list of ER-phagy genes by first performing a cutoff at p < 0.01 and then requiring that true hits have opposite phenotypes in the enhanced and inhibited sort gate. For example, sgRNAs that knockdown a bona fide ER-phagy gene should be depleted in a population undergoing more ER-phagy but enriched in one undergoing less ER-phagy. We quantified involvement in ER-phagy by ratiometrically comparing sgRNA distributions in the enhanced gate to those in the inhibited gate ( Figure 1 B), so that a positive log 2 fold change indicates a gene whose knockdown increases ER-phagy and a negative log 2 fold change indicates a gene whose knockdown inhibits ER-phagy. The resulting high-confidence hit list includes 200 genes, with gene-level log 2 fold change phenotypes ranging from 3.62 to −5.37 ( Table S2 ).
As expected, genes involved in multiple stages of general autophagy and membrane trafficking were high-confidence hits in our screen ( Figure 1 C; Figure S1 H). Individual stable knockdown of these factors and testing using EATR, and mCherry-Cleaved ER-phagy Reporter (CCER) western blot assay, and other measures of autophagy verified their requirement for ER-phagy ( Figures S1 I–S1K). Our stringent criteria for calling a high-confidence hit narrowly exclude some known players in core autophagic pathways (e.g., multiple components of the V-ATPase complex), which have large log 2 fold changes but moderate p values. Since our goal was to identify new and bona fide regulators in the relatively unexplored process of ER-phagy, we opted to maintain very strict statistical cutoffs and thus bias toward false negatives rather than introduce false positives. Overall, the presence of many known autophagic components in the screen indicate that the EATR assay and hence the genome-wide screen reports on ER-phagy pathways rather than ERAD or ERLAD, since the latter do not depend on autophagic components ( Fregno et al., 2018; Ruggiano et al., 2014 21. Fregno, I. ∙ Fasana, E. ∙ Bergmann, T.J. ... ER-to-lysosome-associated degradation of proteasome-resistant ATZ polymers occurs via receptor-mediated vesicular transport EMBO J. 2018; 37 :37 Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar 68. Ruggiano, A. ∙ Foresti, O. ∙ Carvalho, P. Quality control: ER-associated degradation: protein quality control and beyond J. Cell Biol. 2014; 204 :869-879 Crossref Scopus (448) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Consistent with recent reports of functional redundancy between ER-phagy receptors, we found that knockdown of SEC62, TEX264, and FAM134A (paralog of FAM134B) showed consistent but only moderate ER-phagy inhibition upon knockdown ( Figure S1 H) ( Chino et al., 2019 12. Chino, H. ∙ Hatta, T. ∙ Natsume, T. ... Intrinsically Disordered Protein TEX264 Mediates ER-phagy Mol. Cell. 2019; 74 :909-921 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (211) PubMed Google Scholar ). We also examined the performance of individual FAM134B sgRNAs by qRT-PCR and found that none of the CRISPRi sgRNAs in the genome-wide library successfully knocks down FAM134B ( Figure S1 L). This highlights a tradeoff in current CRISPRi screening technology, where allelic series enable interrogation of otherwise essential genes but may introduce false negatives. Genetic redundancy and potential underperformance of CRISPRi guide RNAs means that failure to observe a gene in the ER-phagy screen dataset does not exclude potential role in ER-phagy. However, positive membership in the high-confidence set of 200 genes strongly indicates a role in ER-phagy.
As expected, unbiased gene ontology (GO) analysis, shows enrichment of GO related to autophagy ( Figure 1 C) ( Huang et al., 2009 34. Huang, W. ∙ Sherman, B.T. ∙ Lempicki, R.A. Systematic and integrative analysis of large gene lists using DAVID bioinformatics resources Nat. Protoc. 2009; 4 :44-57 Crossref Scopus (27549) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, multiple aspects of mitochondrial metabolism were unexpectedly prominent. We integrated the high-confidence genetic hits against physical interaction databases to create a putative physical network of ER-phagy ( Chatr-Aryamontri et al., 2017; Szklarczyk et al., 2015 9. Chatr-Aryamontri, A. ∙ Oughtred, R. ∙ Boucher, L. ... The BioGRID interaction database: 2017 update Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45 :D369-D379 Crossref Scopus (717) PubMed Google Scholar 74.

STRING v10: protein-protein interaction networks, integrated over the tree of life Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43 :D447-D452 Crossref Scopus (7569) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 1 D). This network falls into several major classes: autophagic execution, such as ATG10 and WIPI1 ( Phillips et al., 2008; Wartosch et al., 2015; Yuan et al., 2013 63. Phillips, A.R. ∙ Suttangkakul, A. ∙ Vierstra, R.D.

Finally, we manually annotated and subdivided all 200 high-confidence hits into those associated with the lysosome/endosome, ER-associated factors, and nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins ( Table S2 ; Figure 1 E) ( Binder et al., 2014 5.

We were surprised to find that the largest set of genes required for ER-phagy are involved in OXPHOS ( Figure 2 A), since cross-talk between ER-phagy and mitochondrial processes has not yet been described. While interference with mitochondrial energy metabolism induces general cytoplasmic autophagy, loss of mitochondrial factors instead repressed ER-phagy. Mitochondrial factors required for ER-phagy are directly involved in multiple aspects of the electron transport chain (ETC) and OXPHOS: complex I (NDUFA8, NDUFB2, NDUFB4, NDUFS2, NDUFS5), complex III (UQCRC2), and the ATP synthase/complex V (ATP5O and ATP5J) ( Figure 1 E). We also found a large number of factors indirectly required for OXPHOS through either ETC maturation or the synthesis of mitochondrially encoded ETC components ( Taanman, 1999 75. Taanman, J.-W. The mitochondrial genome: structure, transcription, translation and replication Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1410 :103-123 Crossref Scopus (1202) PubMed Google Scholar ): mitochondrial chaperones (BCS1L, COA3, COA4, and OXA1L), mitochondrial ribosome subunits (MRPL17, MRPL16, MRPL22, MRPL24, MRPL30, MRPL33, MRPL34, MRPL41, and MRPL55), mitochondrial tRNAs (AARS2, VARS2, and TARS2), mitochondrial tRNA maturation (PTCD1), and mitochondrial RNase P (KIAA0391, TRMT10C, and HSD17B10). To further interrogate the link between mitochondrial metabolism and ER-phagy, we focused on further investigation of three factors that are involved in different parts of OXPHOS: NDUFB2, NDUFB4, and ATP5O ( Figure S2 A).
Stable knockdown of OXPHOS components quantitatively inhibited starvation-induced ER-phagy in multiple assays in a manner that paralleled knockdown efficiency ( Figures 2 B and S2 B–S2D). However, knockdown of NDUFB2, NDUFB4, or ATP5O did not grossly affect starvation-induced general autophagy ( Figure S2 E). Knockdown of NDUFB2 destabilized NDUFB4 and vice versa, presumably because both are integral subunits of complex I ( Figure S2 B). Consistently, re-expressing the cognate OXPHOS cDNA rescued both the cognate protein and the destabilized partner ( Figure S2 F). Re-expressing the destabilized partner only rescued the abundance of that partner without affecting the knocked-down gene (e.g., NDUFB2 knockdown depletes both NDUFB2 and NDUFB4, and re-expressing NDUFB4 in this background only rescues NDUFB4 levels). Re-expressing the appropriate OXPHOS cDNA rescued ER-phagy, while cross-expressing a non-cognate OXPHOS cDNA had no effect, indicating that each knockdown was specific and on target ( Figure 2 C; Figures S2 F–S2H).
We further explored the necessity of functional OXPHOS for normal ER-phagy using chemical genetics ( Figure S2 I). Rotenone is a known inhibitor of both general autophagy and complex I ( Mader et al., 2012 52. Mader, B.J. ∙ Pivtoraiko, V.N. ∙ Flippo, H.M. ... Rotenone inhibits autophagic flux prior to inducing cell death ACS Chem. Neurosci. 2012; 3 :1063-1072 Crossref Scopus (81) PubMed Google Scholar ) and reduced both general autophagy and ER-phagy by multiple assays ( Figures 2 D and 2E; Figures S2 J–S2L). By contrast, inhibiting complex III with antimycin A or ATP synthase with oligomycin A reduced ER-phagy but increased general autophagy at both early (4 h) and late time points (16 h) ( Figures 2 D and 2E; Figures S2 J–S2M). Using Cell-Titer Glo to measure ATP levels ( Figure S2 N) and Seahorse to measure oxygen consumption ( Figure S2 O), we confirmed that knockdown of the OXPHOS genes reduced cellular energy levels.
We explored several hypotheses to determine how interfering with OXPHOS reduces ER-phagy. First, we found that increased mitophagic flux is not responsible for reduced ER-phagy by titrating away autophagic machinery. OXPHOS conditions that repressed ER-phagy did not grossly alter mitochondrial abundance or membrane potential and starvation actually increased the amount of Mitotracker accumulation ( Figure S3 A) ( Johnson et al., 2014; Xiao et al., 2016 36. Johnson, M.A. ∙ Vidoni, S. ∙ Durigon, R. ... Amino acid starvation has opposite effects on mitochondrial and cytosolic protein synthesis PLoS ONE. 2014; 9 :e93597 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar 90. Xiao, B. ∙ Deng, X. ∙ Zhou, W. ... Flow Cytometry-Based Assessment of Mitophagy Using MitoTracker Front. Cell. Neurosci. 2016; 10 :76 Crossref Scopus (68) PubMed Google Scholar ). We also found no evidence of increased mitophagy during knockdown of OXPHOS components, either with or without stable overexpression of Parkin ( Figures S3 B–S3G).
Second, we found that interfering with OXPHOS reduced levels of the autophagic kinase ULK1 during starvation, but this is not causative of reduced ER-phagy. Knockdown of NDUFB2, NDUFB4, and ATP5O did not affect ULK1 under basal conditions, but during starvation reduced levels of ULK1 almost as much as knockdown of ULK1 itself (Figure S3H). Cognate cDNA re-expression in the appropriate stable knockdown background rescued levels of ULK1, and these same conditions also rescued ER-phagy ( Figure S3 H; Figure 2 C). But overexpression of ULK1 itself in the context of OXPHOS knockdown did not rescue ER-phagy, indicating that reduced ULK1 is not limiting ( Figure S3 I).
Third, we found that reduced ER-phagy upon knockdown of OXPHOS components is independent of 5′ AMP-activated Protein Kinase (AMPK) signaling. This is surprising, since AMPK is a master regulator of general autophagy in response to cellular energy availability ( Egan et al., 2011; Kim et al., 2011; Toyama et al., 2016 18. Egan, D.F. ∙ Shackelford, D.B. ∙ Mihaylova, M.M. ...

AMP-activated protein kinase mediates mitochondrial fission in response to energy stress Science. 2016; 351 :275-281 Crossref Scopus (762) PubMed Google Scholar ). We generated AMPKɑ CRISPR-Cas9 knockout cells ( Figure S3 J) and found that they still mount a robust ER-phagy response ( Figures S3 K and S3L). The ability to perform ER-phagy in AMPKɑ-knockout cells was unaffected by stable re-expression of constitutively active or kinase dead AMPKɑ ( Figures S3 K and S3L). Overall, while genetically or chemically interfering with mitochondrial OXPHOS potently reduces ER-phagy, the mechanism of this cross-talk is independent of canonical pathways and remains unclear.
The genome-wide screen for ER-phagy regulators yielded several hits that are localized to the ER and/or involved in ER-related processes ( Figures 1 E and 3 A). We focused on one of these factors, DDRGK1/C20orf116/UFBP1, which has emerging roles in ER homeostasis ( Leto et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2017; Walczak et al., 2019; Zhu et al., 2019 45.

Individual, stable knockdown of DDRGK1 resulted in ER-phagy as measured using both EATR and CCER assays ( Figures 3 B and 3C; Figure S4 A) but had no apparent effect on general autophagy as determined using mCherry-eGFP-LC3B assay and the degradation of endogenous p62 and LC3B ( Figures 3 C and 3D). Immunofluorescence confirmed that an mCherry-tagged DDRGK1 construct co-localized with the ER ( Figure 3 E).
DDRGK1 is reported to be post-translationally modified by UFMylation, which is in turn required for further UFMylation of other factors ( Cai et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2017; Wei and Xu, 2016; Wu et al., 2010 7.

UFMylation involves the sequential activation, conjugation and ligation of UFM1 to a target substrate via an E1 (UBA5), E2 (UFC1), and E3 (UFL1) cascade that mirrors ubiquitin conjugation ( Figure 4 A) ( Daniel and Liebau, 2014; Komatsu et al., 2004 14.

A novel protein-conjugating system for Ufm1, a ubiquitin-fold modifier EMBO J. 2004; 23 :1977-1986 Crossref Scopus (275) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that stable knockdown of UFL1 decreases DDRGK1 protein levels in a proteasome-dependent manner and also inhibited ER-phagy ( Figures 4 B and 4C; Figure S4 B), as did knockdown of UFM1 and UBA5 ( Figures 4 D and S4 C). Double knockdown of both UFL1 and DDRGK1 did not further inhibition of ER-phagy as compared to individual depletion of either factor, suggesting that they act in the same pathway to regulate ER-phagy ( Figures S4 D and S4E). Stable re-expression of UFL1 in UFL1-depleted cells rescued levels of DDRGK1 and restored ER-phagy ( Figures 4 E and 4F), but overexpression of DDRGK1 in UFL1-depleted cells led to high levels of DDRGK1 without ER-phagy ( Figures 4 E and 4F). Knockdown of DDRGK1 and UFL1 impeded lysosomal cleavage of both mCherry-RAMP4 and mCherry-KDEL, consistent with UFMylation mediating the autophagic turnover of both ER surface and lumenal proteins ( Figures 4 C, S4 F, and S4G) ( Munro and Pelham, 1987 55. Munro, S. ∙ Pelham, H.R. A C-terminal signal prevents secretion of luminal ER proteins Cell. 1987; 48 :899-907 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1827) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We made tandem fluorescent reporters for ER sheets (CLIMP63-mCherry-eGFP) and ER tubules (REEP5-mCherry-eGFP) and found that knockdown of either DDRGK1 or UFL1 specifically impaired the autophagy of ER sheets ( Figures 4 G, S4 H, and S4I). Different ER-phagy receptors are expressed on ER sheets or ER tubules. We found that overexpression of the sheet-localized ER-phagy receptors FAM134B, TEX264, and SEC62 induced ER-phagy, and this was perturbed by the depletion of DDRGK1 in the presence and absence of starvation ( Figures 4 H and S4 J–S4L) ( An et al., 2019; Chino et al., 2019; Fumagalli et al., 2016; Khaminets et al., 2015 4.

Far less ER-phagy was induced by overexpression of the tubule-located ER-phagy receptors CCPG1, RTN3L, and ATL3, and loss of DDRGK1 did not have a statistically significant effect in this context ( Figure 4 H) ( Chen et al., 2019; Grumati et al., 2017; Smith et al., 2018 10.

Cell. 2018; 44 :217-232 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (289) PubMed Google Scholar ). DDRGK1 co-localizes with FAM134B both on the ER and in the lysosome, suggesting that subdomains of the ER containing DDRGK1 are cargos of FAM134B-mediated ER-phagy ( Figure 4 I).
DDRGK1 is reported to be UFMylated by UFL1 on one or more lysines and thereby stabilized ( Figure 5 A) ( Wu et al., 2010 89. Wu, J. ∙ Lei, G. ∙ Mei, M. ... A novel C53/LZAP-interacting protein regulates stability of C53/LZAP and DDRGK domain-containing Protein 1 (DDRGK1) and modulates NF-kappaB signaling J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285 :15126-15136 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (90) PubMed Google Scholar ). Using immunoprecipitation of DDRGK1 point mutants, we indeed found higher molecular weight species consistent with lysine post-translational modification of DDRGK1 ( Figures 5 B and S5 A). However, this modification was unaffected by CRISPR-Cas9 knockout of UFL1 or CRISPRi knockdown of UFM1 ( Figure 5 B and S5 A). Furthermore, knockdown of UFM1 had no effect on the abundance of DDRGK1 ( Figure S5 B), and DDRGK1 still stably interacted with UFL1 even when all 12 conserved lysines were mutated (K-less) ( Figure 5 B). Taken together, these data indicate that the stability of endogenous DDRGK1 is maintained not by UFMylation but by its interaction with UFL1. Along these lines, we found that DDRGK1’s ability to promote ER-phagy was independent of its major reported site of UFMylation on Lys267 ( Figures 5 C and S5 C). Eleven other lysine mutants also substantially supported ER-phagy, as could a DDRGK1 mutant with all 12 conserved lysines mutated ( Figures S5 D and S5E). Overall, these data strongly suggest that DDRGK1 is not a target of UFMylation during ER-phagy, as has been reported for DDRGK1’s involved in the UPR and other signaling pathways ( Lemaire et al., 2011; Yoo et al., 2014 44. Lemaire, K. ∙ Moura, R.F. ∙ Granvik, M. ...

Cell. 2014; 56 :261-274 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (139) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Using immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation, we found that UFL1’s localization to the ER is dependent on DDRGK1. CRISPR-Cas9 knockout of DDRGK1 abrogated ER localization of UFL1, resulting in diffuse, cytosolic UFL1 ( Figure 5 D). We re-expressed various cDNA constructs of DDRGK1 in the DDRGK1 knockout background to map functional regions of the protein. Deleting DDRGK1’s N-terminal ER-targeting transmembrane domain (TM) still supported a DDRGK1-UFL1 interaction but led to cytoplasmic localization of both DDRGK1 and UFL1 without ER-phagy ( Figures 5 E–5H, S6 A, and S6B). Removing DDRGK1’s C-terminal PCI domain did not affect normal ER localization of DDRGK1 but abolished its interaction with UFL1 ( Figures 5 E–5G and S6 A). This led to cytoplasmic localization of UFL1 and abolished the cell’s ability to perform ER-phagy ( Figures 5 E–5G, S5 A, and S5B). Re-targeting DDRGK1 to the mitochondria (TOM20-ΔTMDD-HA) or peroxisomes (PMP34-ΔTMDD-HA) was sufficient to re-target GFP-tagged UFL1 to each organelle ( Figure 5 I). Hence, DDRGK1’s interaction with UFL1 via its PCI domain dictates the subcellular localization of UFL1.
During mitophagy, numerous proteins are ubiquitylated on the mitochondrial surface. But current models of mitophagy suggest that overall ubiquitin load is more important than any one substrate ( Chan et al., 2011; Heo et al., 2015; Ordureau et al., 2014 8. Chan, N.C. ∙ Salazar, A.M. ∙ Pham, A.H. ... Broad activation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system by Parkin is critical for mitophagy Hum. Mol.

Quantitative proteomics reveal a feedforward mechanism for mitochondrial PARKIN translocation and ubiquitin chain synthesis Mol. Cell. 2014; 56 :360-375 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (508) PubMed Google Scholar ). Hence, we asked whether directly recruiting UFL1 to the ER surface could bypass the need for DDRGK1 ( Figure S6 C). However, expression of UFL1-RAMP4 in DDRGK1-depleted cells was not sufficient to rescue ER-phagy despite robust localization to the ER surface ( Figures S6 C–S6F). Together, these data indicate that DDRGK1 both recruits UFL1 to the ER and plays a role in activation of its ligase activity or recruitment of substrates during ER-phagy. We find that DDRGK1 is not a UFMylation substrate during ER-phagy and is instead analogous to an ubiquitin substrate adaptor (e.g., an F-box protein) that works with Cullin-RING family proteins.
To identify candidate substrates of DDRGK1/UFL1 dependent UFMylation on the ER, we first knocked down previously reported substrates of UFL1 including CDK5RAP3, SOX9, and ASC1 ( Cai et al., 2015; Egunsola et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2010; Yoo et al., 2014 7.

We therefore performed immunoprecipitation-tandem mass spectrometry (IP-MS/MS) label-free proteomics to identify new interactors of DDRGK1 and DDRGK1-dependent UFMylation substrates during EBSS starvation. To identify DDRGK1 interactors, non-denaturing IP-MS/MS was performed in DDRGK1 knockout HEK293T clones that either did or did not stably re-express HA-tagged DDRGK1 ( Figure 6 A). To identify DDRGK1-dependent UFMylated proteins, we counteracted the constitutive deconjugation of UFM1 from substrates by UFSP2 ( Walczak et al., 2019 81. Walczak, C.P. ∙ Leto, D.E. ∙ Zhang, L. ... Ribosomal protein RPL26 is the principal target of UFMylation Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2019; 116 :1299-1308 Crossref Scopus (96) PubMed Google Scholar ) by generating CRISPR-Cas9 UFSP2 knockout clones in both wild-type and DDRGK1 knockout HEK2393T cells ( Figure 6 B). In the UFSP2 knockout and DDRGK1/UFSP2 double-knockout cells, we transiently expressed UFM1 lacking the C-terminal Cys-Ser residues (HA-UFM1-ΔCS) to override the need for UFSP2 cleavage prior to conjugation ( Figure 6 B). UFMylated proteins were isolated using a denaturing HA-tag IP during EBSS starvation and folimycin treatment (to prevent lysosomal degradation).
The top differentially enriched proteins from DDRGK1 immunoprecipitation in cells lacking or expressing DDRGK1 were DDRGK1 itself and UFL1 ( Figure 6 C; Table S3 ). We also identified several large ribosomal subunits and ribosome-associated factors, including RPL7A, RPLP0, RPL10A, RPL30, and RPL19. This is consistent with recent reports that the ribosome interacts with and is modified by the UFMylation machinery ( Simsek et al., 2017; Walczak et al., 2019 72. Simsek, D. ∙ Tiu, G.C. ∙ Flynn, R.A. ...

The top UFMylated proteins in both UFSP2 knockout and DDRGK1/UFSP2 double-knockout cells were UFM1 itself, UBA5, and UFC1; UFL1 and DDRGK1 were not identified ( Figure 6 D; Table S4 ). These data confirm that this experiment monitors UFMylation, since UFM1 forms a covalent bond with UBA5 and UFC1 but non-covalent interactions with UFL1 and DDRGK1 ( Table S4 ) ( Komatsu et al., 2004; Tatsumi et al., 2010 41. Komatsu, M. ∙ Chiba, T. ∙ Tatsumi, K. ... A novel protein-conjugating system for Ufm1, a ubiquitin-fold modifier EMBO J. 2004; 23 :1977-1986 Crossref Scopus (275) PubMed Google Scholar 76.

Comparing UFMylation in UFSP2 knockout cells to DDRGK1/UFSP2 double-knockout cells, we identified RPL26, which is a recently reported substrate of DDRGK1-mediated UFMylation ( Figure 6 D) ( Walczak et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020 81. Walczak, C.P. ∙ Leto, D.E. ∙ Zhang, L. ... Ribosomal protein RPL26 is the principal target of UFMylation Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2019; 116 :1299-1308 Crossref Scopus (96) PubMed Google Scholar 85. Wang, L. ∙ Xu, Y. ∙ Rogers, H. ... UFMylation of RPL26 links translocation-associated quality control to endoplasmic reticulum protein homeostasis Cell Res. 2020; 30 :5-20 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar ). Several factors involved in membrane trafficking between organelles and endosomes were also UFMylated in a DDRGK1-dependent manner, such as RAB1A/B, RAB5C, ARF4, and Clathrin. We further identified Ribophorin1 (RPN1), which was notable for several reasons. First, RPN1 is an ER-resident quality-control factor present on ER sheets that is part of the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex ( Figure S6 I) ( Kelleher et al., 1992 38. Kelleher, D.J. ∙ Kreibich, G. ∙ Gilmore, R. Oligosaccharyltransferase activity is associated with a protein complex composed of ribophorins I and II and a 48 kd protein Cell. 1992; 69 :55-65 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (254) PubMed Google Scholar ). Second, RPN1 contains a significant cytoplasmic domain that could potentially be accessible for UFMylation during ER-phagy ( Figure 6 E) ( Tsao et al., 1992 80. Tsao, Y.S. ∙ Ivessa, N.E. ∙ Adesnik, M. ... Carboxy terminally truncated forms of ribophorin I are degraded in pre-Golgi compartments by a calcium-dependent process J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116 :57-67 Crossref Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ). Third, RPN1 and the rest of the OST are associated with the SEC61/62/63 translocon complex ( Yan and Lennarz, 2005 92. Yan, A. ∙ Lennarz, W.J. Two oligosaccharyl transferase complexes exist in yeast and associate with two different translocons Glycobiology. 2005; 15 :1407-1415 Crossref Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ). SEC62 has been identified as an ER-phagy receptor, and we found that that SEC62 is epistatic with DDRGK1 during ER-phagy ( Figure 5 I) ( Fumagalli et al., 2016 23. Fumagalli, F. ∙ Noack, J. ∙ Bergmann, T.J. ... Translocon component Sec62 acts in endoplasmic reticulum turnover during stress recovery Nat. Cell Biol. 2016; 18 :1173-1184 Crossref Scopus (305) PubMed Google Scholar ). And fourth, the SEC61/62/63 translocon complex and OST associate with the ribosome during co-translational folding, where they are structurally located immediately adjacent to RPL26 and large ribosomal subunit proteins that we found to interact with DDRGK1 such as RPL30 ( Figure 6 E) ( Braunger et al., 2018 6. Braunger, K. ∙ Pfeffer, S. ∙ Shrimal, S. ... Structural basis for coupling protein transport and N-glycosylation at the mammalian endoplasmic reticulum Science. 2018; 360 :215-219 Crossref Scopus (145) PubMed Google Scholar ). RPN1 and RPL26 are both “common essential” genes, required for the survival of every cell line tested by DepMap. The raw guide RNA counts for RPN1 and RPL26 are very low in all populations of the CRISPRi ER-phagy screen, explaining why neither appeared in the high-confidence hit list. Using immunoprecipitation and western blotting, we validated that both RPL26 and RPN1 are UFMylated and this UFMylation is abrogated by knockout of DDRGK1 ( Figures 6 F and 6G).
IRE1α is an ER stress sensor and was previously reported as a substrate of UFMylation to promote the UPR, but we found no evidence for DDRGK1-mediated UFMylation nor stabilization of IRE1α during ER-phagy by either IP-MS/MS or IP-western blot ( Figure 6 B; Table S4 ; Figure S7 A) ( Liu et al., 2017 50. Liu, J. ∙ Wang, Y. ∙ Song, L. ... A critical role of DDRGK1 in endoplasmic reticulum homoeostasis via regulation of IRE1α stability Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :14186 Crossref Scopus (92) PubMed Google Scholar ). Instead, we conversely found that depletion of DDRGK1, UFL1, or UFM1 (HepG2, MCF7 and HeLa cells) resulted in elevated protein levels of IRE1α in multiple cell types ( Figures 7 A and S7 B–S7D). These results suggested that an inability to perform UFMylation-dependent ER-phagy could lead to upregulation of an ER stress response through IRE1α, which senses misfolded proteins in the ER lumen. Indeed, knockdown of UFMylation ER-phagy factors led to elevated levels of several other UPR proteins including PERK, BiP, and CANX ( Figures 7 A and S7 B). We also observed an increase in levels of CLIMP63 (ER sheet marker) and REEP5 (ER tubule marker), suggesting possible ER expansion ( Figures 7 A and S7 B) ( Schuck et al., 2009 69. Schuck, S. ∙ Prinz, W.A. ∙ Thorn, K.S. ... Membrane expansion alleviates endoplasmic reticulum stress independently of the unfolded protein response J. Cell Biol. 2009; 187 :525-536 Crossref Scopus (406) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistent with this idea, immunofluorescence of DDRGK1 CRISPR-Cas9 knockout HeLa cells showed increased CANX staining ( Figures S7 D and S7E). Knockdown of DDRGK1 or UFL1 led to modest but consistent transcriptional upregulation of the UPR transcripts PERK and BiP, increased differential splicing of XBP1, and upregulation of CLIMP63 and REEP5 ( Figure 7 B). As opposed to the other ER stress markers, IRE1α showed higher protein levels upon DDRGK1 knockdown but no change in transcript abundance ( Figures 7 A and 7B), indicating that IRE1α protein levels could be post-translationally regulated in response to UFM1 signaling. The transcriptional upregulation of multiple UPR transcripts, differential splicing of XBP1, post-translational upregulation of IRE1α, and ER expansion are all consistent with increased ER stress and consequent UPR under conditions where UFMylation-dependent ER-phagy cannot be executed. The upregulation of ER stress markers upon DDRGK1 or UFL1 knockdown are weaker than during acutely toxic tunicamycin treatment, suggesting that the disruption of the UFMylation-mediated ER-phagy represents a chronic, survivable ER stress ( Figure 7 B).
IRE1α senses unfolded proteins in the ER lumen and so is a good candidate to mediate stress signals caused by defective ER-phagy. While we did not observe direct UFMylation of IRE1α under either fed or starved conditions ( Figure S7 A), knockdown of IRE1α in DDRGK1-depleted cells reversed the high levels of UPR markers downstream of IRE1α caused by an inability to execute ER-phagy ( Figure S7 F). BiP, which is an upstream factor of IRE1α signaling, was upregulated in DDRGK1-depleted cells but was not affected by IRE1α depletion ( Figure S7 F) ( Amin-Wetzel et al., 2017; Oikawa et al., 2009 3.

Knockdown of IRE1α had only a modest reciprocal effect upon ER-phagy, and only somewhat reversed the ER-phagy defect induced by loss of DDRGK1 ( Figure 7 C). Hence, UFMylation-induced ER-phagy is upstream of IREα signaling.
Overall, our data indicate that DDRGK1-mediated, ER-resident UFMylation is critical for ER-phagy. DDRGK1 recruits UFL1 to promote ER surface UFMylation. We propose that the inability to UFMylate downstream ER substrates such as RPN1 and RPL26 leads to an inability to execute ER-phagy, resulting in the consequent build-up of ER stress, and eventual activation of the unfolded protein response via IRE1α ( Figure 7 D).

Section: Discussion

Our genome-wide ER-phagy screen provides a rich set of genes and pathways that greatly expands our understanding of ER-phagy and provides many starting points for further investigation. Among these, we identified several aspects of the core autophagy machinery, consistent with studies showing that ER-phagy shares effectors with general autophagy ( Grumati et al., 2017; Khaminets et al., 2015; Smith et al., 2018 28.

Cell. 2018; 44 :217-232 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (289) PubMed Google Scholar ).
So far, nutrient starvation is the only stress known to directly induce ER-phagy. We found that ER stress-inducing compounds do not lead to ER-phagy, but repression of ER-phagy by knockdown of DDRGK1 UFMylation induces ER stress and the UPR. UFMylation has previously been linked to ER stress through unclear mechanisms ( DeJesus et al., 2016; Leto et al., 2019; Walczak et al., 2019 16. DeJesus, R. ∙ Moretti, F. ∙ McAllister, G. ...

Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2019; 116 :1299-1308 Crossref Scopus (96) PubMed Google Scholar ), and our data suggest that this is connected to the regulation of ER-phagy. How is it that ER stress does not induce ER-phagy but an inability to perform ER-phagy induces ER stress? Under nutrient depletion, protein misfolding may increase in the ER, but these signals are repressed as cells catabolize the protein- and lipid-rich organelle. Blocking ER-phagy could then result in the toxic accumulation of excessive ER and misfolded ER-resident proteins that cannot be sufficiently kept in check by ERAD, thus activating the UPR. Under this model, blocking ER-phagy leads to UPR as a byproduct of ER stress that is no longer relieved by eating portions of the ER. This hypothesis and ordered prioritization of ER stress-relief pathways will require a great deal of investigation but could lead to a molecular rationale for why cells go to the extreme of ER-phagy.
We found extensive interplay between the mitochondria and ER-phagy. The ER and mitochondria are known to crosstalk at membrane contact sites, including transfer and expansion of the lipid bilayer, Ca 2+ homeostasis, and mitochondria division ( Friedman et al., 2011; Lombardi and Elrod, 2017 22. Friedman, J.R. ∙ Lackner, L.L. ∙ West, M. ... ER tubules mark sites of mitochondrial division Science. 2011; 334 :358-362 Crossref Scopus (1470) PubMed Google Scholar 51. Lombardi, A.A. ∙ Elrod, J.W. Mediating ER-mitochondrial cross-talk Science. 2017; 358 :591-592 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ). Previous studies indicate a unidirectional regulatory role of ER processes toward mitochondrial homeostasis. We found that impairment of mitochondrial OXPHOS represses ER-phagy, demonstrating that mitochondrial metabolism can also inform decisions in the ER. It still remains to be seen whether this communication is directly orchestrated via mitochondria-ER contacts or indirectly as a result of metabolic products. Alternatively, inhibition of OXPHOS could initiate UPR that takes over to repress last-resort ER-phagy. Consistently, mitochondrial dysfunction was reported to trigger the integrated stress response (ISR) which converges with the UPR pathway, further highlighting the complex cross-talk between the two organelles ( Guo et al., 2019 29. Guo, X. ∙ Aviles, G. ∙ Liu, Y. ... Mitochondrial dysfunction is signaled to the integrated stress response by OMA1, DELE1 and HRI bioRxiv. 2019; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). Cellular energy levels are regulated by multiple energy sensing mechanisms that have complex roles during general autophagy ( Egan et al., 2011; Herzig and Shaw, 2018; Kim et al., 2011 18. Egan, D.F. ∙ Shackelford, D.B. ∙ Mihaylova, M.M. ...

Cell Biol. 2011; 13 :132-141 Crossref Scopus (5259) PubMed Google Scholar ), and the interplay between mitochondrial metabolism and ER homeostasis will no doubt involve a rich set of pathways for future investigation.
UFMylation have been implicated in DNA repair, transcriptional regulation, and ribosomal modification, all of which occur in different subcellular compartments ( Egunsola et al., 2017; Qin et al., 2019; Walczak et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019 19.

Commun. 2019; 10 :1242 Crossref Scopus (85) PubMed Google Scholar 81. Walczak, C.P. ∙ Leto, D.E. ∙ Zhang, L. ... Ribosomal protein RPL26 is the principal target of UFMylation Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

MRE11 UFMylation promotes ATM activation Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 :4124-4135 Crossref Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ). It has been unclear how the mostly cytoplasmic UFL1 ligase accesses each compartment. We found that DDRGK1 recruits UFL1 to the ER surface for UFMylation-dependent ER-phagy. Post-translational modifications of organelle surfaces are widely involved in organelle autophagy. For example, ubiquitylation of PEX5 serves as a signal for peroxisomal autophagy ( Nordgren et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2015a 58. Nordgren, M. ∙ Francisco, T. ∙ Lismont, C. ... Export-deficient monoubiquitinated PEX5 triggers peroxisome removal in SV40 large T antigen-transformed mouse embryonic fibroblasts Autophagy. 2015; 11 :1326-1340 Crossref Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar 96. Zhang, J. ∙ Tripathi, D.N. ∙ Jing, J. ... ATM functions at the peroxisome to induce pexophagy in response to ROS Nat. Cell Biol. 2015; 17 :1259-1269 Crossref Scopus (314) PubMed Google Scholar ), and ubiquitylation of multiple mitochondrial substrates promotes mitophagy ( Chan et al., 2011; Karbowski and Youle, 2011 8. Chan, N.C. ∙ Salazar, A.M. ∙ Pham, A.H. ... Broad activation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system by Parkin is critical for mitophagy Hum. Mol.

Regulating mitochondrial outer membrane proteins by ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2011; 23 :476-482 Crossref Scopus (199) PubMed Google Scholar ). Since DDRGK1 recruits UFL1 to the ER surface and their combined ER-resident activity with UFM1 are required for ER-phagy, we speculate that UFMylation of ER surface protein(s) serves as an effector of ER-phagy, similar to PINK1’s recruitment of Parkin to ubiquitylate mitochondrial surface proteins during mitophagy ( Chan et al., 2011; Glauser et al., 2011; Karbowski and Youle, 2011; Wang et al., 2011 8.

We identified RPN1, a subunit of the ER-localized OST complex, as a novel DDRGK1-dependent UFMylation substrate. For several reasons, we propose that RPN1 is part of a UFMylation “hub” that participates in ER-resident quality control. The OST complex associates with ribosomes and the SEC61/62/63 complex for nascent protein translocation and maturation ( Braunger et al., 2018; Kelleher et al., 1992; Shibata et al., 2010; Wilson et al., 2005; Yan and Lennarz, 2005 6.

Two oligosaccharyl transferase complexes exist in yeast and associate with two different translocons Glycobiology. 2005; 15 :1407-1415 Crossref Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ). RPL26 is a known UFMylation substrate within the 60S large ribosomal subunit and sits in in close proximity with RPN1 ( Figures 6 E and 7 D) ( Walczak et al., 2019 81. Walczak, C.P. ∙ Leto, D.E. ∙ Zhang, L. ... Ribosomal protein RPL26 is the principal target of UFMylation Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2019; 116 :1299-1308 Crossref Scopus (96) PubMed Google Scholar ). DDRGK1 also physically interacts with multiple components of the large 60S ribosomal subunits that are nearby RPN1.
The downstream parts played by UFMylated RPN1 during ER marking, autophagic engulfment, and degradation remain to be determined. Dysregulation of glycosylation by interfering with the OST complex and inhibition of UFMylation both cause ER stress ( Cherepanova et al., 2016; Walczak et al., 2019 11. Cherepanova, N. ∙ Shrimal, S. ∙ Gilmore, R. N-linked glycosylation and homeostasis of the endoplasmic reticulum Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2016; 41 :57-65 Crossref Scopus (171) PubMed Google Scholar 81.

The SEC62 ER-stress activated ER-phagy receptor is part of the translocon complex directly adjacent to the OST complex, and we found DDRGK1 to be epistatic to SEC62 during ER-phagy ( Fumagalli et al., 2016; Kelleher et al., 1992; Tsao et al., 1992; Walczak et al., 2019; Wilson et al., 2005 23.

Chem. 2005; 280 :4195-4206 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ). Since RPN1 contains an N-terminal cytoplasmic domain and a C-terminal ER lumenal domain, it is possible that RPN1 might relay ER stress signals via ER-surface UFMylation during peptide translocation. Failure to relay and appropriately deal with these signals on the ribosome-rich ER sheets could induce the IRE1α-mediated UPR induced by blockage of DDRGK1-dependent UFMylation. Nascent proteins trapped in the ribosome induces RPL26 UFMylation and lysosomal degradation of the stalled protein and ribosome en bloc ( Wang et al., 2020 85. Wang, L. ∙ Xu, Y. ∙ Rogers, H. ... UFMylation of RPL26 links translocation-associated quality control to endoplasmic reticulum protein homeostasis Cell Res. 2020; 30 :5-20 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is currently unknown whether these UFMylated ribosomes are physically extracted from the ER prior to lysosomal degradation, or if portions of the ER are degraded alongside the UFMylated ribosomes. Importantly, RPN1 and RPL26 might not be the exclusive targets of UFMylation and simultaneous UFMylation of other ER surface proteins could be required to drive ER-phagy in a cooperative manner. Overall, our data unify disparate reports of UFMylation impacting the UPR and provide a mechanistic rationale for how autophagy of ER sheets helps to prevent accumulation of ER stress. This opens up a great deal of further avenues to dissect the subsequent steps by which UFMylation is recognized on the ER surface to mediate ER-phagy.
While defects in ER-phagy have not been explicitly linked to human disease, human mutations in ER-phagy genes such as FAM134B and Atlastins are associated with hereditary neuropathies in OMIM and ClinVar ( Abel et al., 2004; Amberger et al., 2015; Kurth et al., 2009 1.

Several ER-phagy genes derived from our screen are also associated with human neurodegenerative phenotypes with previously unclear mechanistic bases, such as Leigh syndrome (mitochondrial OXPHOS, including ETC chaperones) ( Lake et al., 2016 43.

It is premature to broadly link deficits in ER-phagy to human disease, but the similar phenotypes stemming from mutations in various ER-phagy factors are provocative. Our work lays the foundation for future understanding of ER-phagy and its interplay with the ER stress response, as well as the consequences of ineffective ER-phagy. Further mechanistic dissection of the 200 high-confidence ER-phagy regulators and executors identified here will hopefully shed light on this dramatic process.

The genome-wide CRISPRi-V2 library was a gift from the Weismann lab (Addgene catalog #1000000093) and contains 5 sgRNAs per gene. For the pilot autophagy screen, we designed a comprehensive sgRNA library that targets all the reported TSS (10 gRNAs per TSS) of 31 genes that are involved in general autophagy. Overall, a total of 3301 gRNAs were designed ( Table S1 ). The protospacer oligos were annealed and ligated to pCRISPRia vector (Addgene 84832) according to the protocol established by the Weissman lab ( https://weissmanlab.ucsf.edu/CRISPR/Pooled_CRISPR_Library_Cloning.pdf ) ( Horlbeck et al., 2016 33. Horlbeck, M.A. ∙ Gilbert, L.A. ∙ Villalta, J.E. ... Compact and highly active next-generation libraries for CRISPR-mediated gene repression and activation eLife. 2016; 5 Published online September 23, 2016 Crossref Scopus (430) Google Scholar ). In addition, we added in 10% of a custom built non-targeting sgRNA library prior to virus production.
The following paragraph describes the transfection protocol for one 15 cm plate of HEK293T cells. On Day 0, 7.5 million HEK293T cells were seeded in a 15 cm plate in 20 mL of DMEM medium with 10% FBS. The following day HEK293T cells were transfected. In a 15 mL tube, 2.8 mL of Opti-MEM was mixed with 90 μL of Mirus LT1 transfection reagent and incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes. In an eppendorf tube, 12 μg of delta VPR, 3 μg of VSVG, and 15 μg of library plasmid were combined. The plasmids were then added to the Opti-MEM and Mirus mixture and incubated at room temperature for 20 minutes. The media was changed the following day. On Day 3, the virus was harvested using a 0.45 μm syringe filter, aliquoted into 1 mL tubes, and snap frozen. If more than one 15 cm plate of virus was produced for one library, the virus across those plates were pooled and mixed prior to aliquoting into eppendorf tubes. Virus was harvest on Day 4 as well.
Next, the virus was titered to determine the infectivity of the virus in the HCT116 cells. HCT116 were plated in a series of 6 well plates such that each well had cells and there was one 6 well plate per sub-library per time point (i.e., 48 or 72 hour virus harvest). One well on each plate was not transduced with any virus. The virus was titered such that is diluted 2-fold, 4-fold, 8-fold, 16-fold, and 32-fold. Polybrene was used at a concentration of 8 μg/mL. Fresh media were replaced 24hr post transduction. The cells were harvested 48 hours post viral transduction for flow cytometry and the percentage of BFP positive cells was recorded. The optimal virus dilution is defined as dilution-fold that results in less than 20% of BFP positive cells.
HCT116 cells stably expressing a dcas9-KRAB and doxycycline-inducible EATR reporter was generated by lentiviral transduction of Addgene constructs 102244 and 109014 ( Liang et al., 2018 48. Liang, J.R. ∙ Lingeman, E. ∙ Ahmed, S. ... Atlastins remodel the endoplasmic reticulum for selective autophagy J. Cell Biol. 2018; 217 :3354-3367 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ). The library contained seven unique sub-libraries and each sub-library was transduced separately, such that each sgRNA had an average of 500x coverage after transduction (Day 1). Puromycin selection for positively-transduced cells was performed 48 hours post transduction (Day 3). On Day 7, the sub-libraries were pooled proportionally based on the number of sgRNAs and cells were maintained at 500x coverage. On Day 10, cells were treated with doxycycline (4μg/ml) for 16 hours to induce EATR expression and on Day 11, cells were treated with EBSS for 16 hours. Cells were then collected for sorting - cells were gated into the 25% of cells with most ER-phagy and 25% of cells with the least ER-phagy. A background population of cells was collected for downstream NGS analysis of relative enrichment.The entire CRISPRi screen was performed in two biological replicates.
Genomic DNA was harvested using the Macherey-Nagel gDNA extraction protocol. The background samples required the XL kit whereas the midi kit was sufficient for sorted cells. After elution, the genomic DNA was treated with SbfI-HI restriction enzyme and incubated overnight at 37°C to liberate the DNA fragment encoding the sgRNA sequences.
Samples were run an agarose gel and the gel piece around the 500 bp size (region containing the sgRNA sequence) was excised. The gel was melted in 55°C water bath and 1/100 by volume of 3 M NaAc (pH 5.2) was added to each tube and then solution was passed through an MN column. Each column was washed twice with NT3 buffer. The column was incubated for 5 minutes in 20 μL of heated elution buffer (98°C) and then spun. The elution step was repeated so that the final elution volume was 40 μL.
A standard PCR protocol was used with Phusion High Fidelity Enzyme and 3% DMSO final concentration.The forward primer contained a TruSeq Index that would be subsequently used during NGS analysis. Before proceeding with a full scale PCR of the samples, a test PCR for each sample was run to determine the proper number of cycles (21, 23, or 25 cycles). The cycle number was identified individually for each sample that allowed a visible band on a TBE gel after staining with ethidium bromide, but not an oversaturated PCR product that could compromise the representation of gRNAs within the sample.
After the optimal cycle number was determine, a total of twelve 100 μL PCRs were done with 3 μL of template per reaction (from the abovementioned elution). The forward primer contained a TruSeq Index that would be subsequently used during NGS analysis. After completion of the PCR, the twelve reactions were pooled together and mixed. 300 μL of the pooled PCR was taken for subsequent PCR clean-up.
195 μL of SPRI beads was added to the pooled PCR and incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes. The samples were attached to a DynaMag for 5 minutes. The supernatant (which has the sample) was transferred to a new tube. 300 μL of SPRI beads were added and incubated for another 10 minutes. The samples were attached to a DynaMag for 5 minutes and the supernatant was discarded (samples attached to the beads). The beads were washed twice with 80% ethanol. After removal of the last supernatant, the beads were spun down, and excess ethanol was removed. The samples were air-dried for 10 minutes and resuspended in 35 μL of water. DNA concentration was quantified using Qubit Fluorometric Quantitation (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the samples were pooled proportionally to cell number and sequenced on a HiSeq 2500 such that each sgRNA sequence was covered at least 30 times.
Screening data was analyzed using standard protocols in MaGECK and ScreenProcessing ( Horlbeck et al., 2016; Li et al., 2014, 2015 33. Horlbeck, M.A. ∙ Gilbert, L.A. ∙ Villalta, J.E. ...

Li, W. ∙ Köster, J. ∙ Xu, H. ... Quality control, modeling, and visualization of CRISPR screens with MAGeCK-VISPR Genome Biol. 2015; 16 :281 Crossref Scopus (243) PubMed Google Scholar ). MaGECK was used for the pilot autophagy library, while ScreenProcessing was used for the genome-wide library. Briefly, gRNAs were quantified in each pool of cells based by matching reads back to the appropriate library reference, each pool was normalized by total number of reads, and gRNA distributions were compared to the background. Non-targeting gRNAs were explicitly used in each software package. MaGECK and ScreenProcessing integrate multiple gRNAs into gene-level phenotypes (e.g., log 2 -fold-change) and p values using different approaches ( Horlbeck et al., 2016; Li et al., 2014, 2015 33.

The sgRNA sequences for genome-wide screening were based on the Weissman CRISPRi-v2 library and contained 5 sgRNAs per gene. The sgRNA sequences for autophagy-related genes used for the pilot-test run were custom-designed to target all reported transcription start site (TSS) of each gene and contained 10 sgRNAs per TSS. sgRNA plasmids were cloned by annealing and ligating sgRNA-containing short oligos to the CRISPRi-v2 vector (addgene 84832) via the previously described protocol ( Horlbeck et al., 2016 33. Horlbeck, M.A. ∙ Gilbert, L.A. ∙ Villalta, J.E. ... Compact and highly active next-generation libraries for CRISPR-mediated gene repression and activation eLife. 2016; 5 Published online September 23, 2016 Crossref Scopus (430) Google Scholar ). Brriefly, the forward and reverse primers of each sgRNA were annealed by pre-incubation at 37°C for 30min in the presence of T4 polynucleotide kinase (PNK; NEB) followed by incubation at 95°C for 5 min and then ramp down to 25°C at 5°C /min. The annealed sgRNA inserts were then ligated to CRISPRia-v2 plasmid (digested using BstXI and BlpI) using Quick ligation kit (NEB). Knockdown efficiency of each guide was measured either by western blot or qRT-PCR. All sgRNA constructs used in this study are detailed in Table S3 .
Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) was used to knockdown DDRGK1 in cell lines that do not express dCas9-KRAB constructs. Non-targeting (5′-CCTAAGGTTAAGTCGCCCTCG-3′), DDRGK1-targeting (5′-GGCTCTGCTAGTCGGCTTTAT-3′) and UFL1-targeting (5′-GCTTCTTTACTCTGTGCTTGA-3′) shRNAs were cloned into pLKO.1 puro construct (Addgene #8453) according to protocol described in Addgene ( https://www.addgene.org/protocols/plko/?gclid&equals;Cj0KCQiAm5viBRD4ARIsADGUT25ZCGNPeQSFvLqSwvg2tHDkCc9zOZsLdaUffZzNTRYzI_YOlKFVQdUaAqbfEALw_wcB ). Briefly, the shRNAs were cloned by standard annealing (same as sgRNA annealing protocol described in the previous section) and ligated to pLKO.1 construct (digested with AgeI-HF and EcoRI-HF).
Unless stated otherwise, all ORFs described in this article were obtained from PCR amplification of HCT116 cDNA. The ORFs were cloned into pLenti-XI destination vector with neomycin resistance. Briefly, an original pLenti-X1-Neo-eGFP-LC3B vector was first digested with restriction enzymes BamHI and XbaI to remove the eGFP-LC3B insert. Then, Gibson Assembly was used to insert the gene-of-interest and the desired epitope or fluorescent tag into the pLenti-X1 vector ( Gibson et al., 2009 25. Gibson, D.G. ∙ Young, L. ∙ Chuang, R.-Y. ... Enzymatic assembly of DNA molecules up to several hundred kilobases Nat. Methods. 2009; 6 :343-345 Crossref Scopus (6391) PubMed Google Scholar ). All overexpression constructs used in this study are detailed in Table S4 .
Cells were cultured at 37 ° C with 5% CO 2 in a humidified atmosphere. All cells were cultured in DMEM-GlutaMAX medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 0.1 mM non-essential amino acids (GIBCO), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (GIBCO), 100 U/mL penicillin (GIBCO), and 100 g/mL streptomycin (GIBCO). Cell lines were obtained from the Berkeley Cell Culture Facility and were verified mycoplasma free with MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Lonza).
ER-phagy was induced with media starvation using EBSS with calcium, magnesium, and phenol red (Invitrogen e10043). For EATR and CCER assays, cells were plated 48 hours prior to EBSS treatment. EATR expression is induced using 4 μg/ml doxycycline 24hr prior to starvation. Unless otherwise stated, starvation treatment was carried out for 16 hours. Cells in fed conditions indicate incubation in complete DMEM described above.
For all experiments except the Seahorse assay, rotenone was used at a final concentration of 3 μM, antimycin A was used at a concentration of 0.5 μM, and oligomycin A was used at a concentration of 3 μM. Cells were treated with these drugs in two phases for a total of 40 hours. First, cells were treated for 24 hours with complete DMEM, then immediately treated again for 16 hours in EBSS media or complete DMEM. Unless stated otherwise, epoxomicin and folimycin treatments were co-administered with EBSS starvation at 100 nM final concentration.
Lentiviral packaging was performed in HEK293T cells using either TransIT-LT1 Transfection Reagent (Mirus) or Lipofectamine 3000 (ThermoFisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, delta-VPR, VSVG, and the construct of interest were transfected at the ratio of 4:1:5. Lentiviral supernatant was harvested at 48hr post-transfection and HEK293T cells were replenished with fresh media for another harvest at 72hr post-transfection.
AMPK knockout cell lines were generated using Cas9 RNPs and nucleofection as detailed previously ( Lingeman et al., 2017 49. Lingeman, E. ∙ Jeans, C. ∙ Corn, J.E. Production of purified casrnps for efficacious genome editing Curr. Protoc. Mol. Biol. 2017; 120 :31.10.1-31.10.19 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ). The sgRNA protospacer sequences were validated and used previously by the Shaw lab ( Toyama et al., 2016 79. Toyama, E.Q. ∙ Herzig, S. ∙ Courchet, J. ... Metabolism. AMP-activated protein kinase mediates mitochondrial fission in response to energy stress Science. 2016; 351 :275-281 Crossref Scopus (762) PubMed Google Scholar ). The protospacer sequences are as follow: AMPKα1-sgRNA1- GGCTGTCGCCATCTTTCTCC; AMPKα1-sgRNA2- GAAGATCGGCCACTACATTC; AMPKα2-sgRNA1- TCAGCCATCTTCGGCGCGCG; AMPKα2-sgRNA2- GAAGATCGGACACTACGTGC. After nucleofection, HCT116 cells were serial diluted into 96 well plates such that there was on average of 0.7 cells/well. AMPK KO clones were screened by western blotting. DDRGK1, UFL1 and UFSP2 knockout cell lines were using pSpCas9(BB)-2A-GFP (PX458) (Addgene #48138) plasmids carrying sgRNAs that targets the respective regions close to the transcription start site. For DDRGK1 and UFL1, two guides were used simultaneously to remove the transcription start sites. The knockout of UFSP2 was performed using only one guide based on reported sequence ( Walczak et al., 2019 81. Walczak, C.P. ∙ Leto, D.E. ∙ Zhang, L. ... Ribosomal protein RPL26 is the principal target of UFMylation Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2019; 116 :1299-1308 Crossref Scopus (96) PubMed Google Scholar ). The protospacer sequences are as follow: DDRGK1-sgRNA1- ATGAGATCCCGGCCTCAGGG; DDRGK1-sgRNA2- TAGGAGATGCCGCTGCACCA; UFL1-sgRNA1- CTGACTCGCAGTAGACGCGG; UFL1-sgRNA2- GCCTAATT TGGGCTCCACAA; UFSP2-sgRNA1- AATAAGAGGAGGCCTTGATT. GFP-positive cells were single-cell sorted 48hr post transfection and knockout clones were screened by western blotting and selected clones were further validated by Sanger sequencing.
Flow cytometry of EATR assay was performed using an Attune NxT Flow Cytometer and subsequent analysis was performed using FlowJo 10.1 ( Liang et al., 2018 48. Liang, J.R. ∙ Lingeman, E. ∙ Ahmed, S. ... Atlastins remodel the endoplasmic reticulum for selective autophagy J. Cell Biol. 2018; 217 :3354-3367 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ). All EATR experiments were performed using live cells to prevent reversal of eGFP quenching post-fixation. The intensities for both eGFP and mCherry of the EATR cells at fed condition were used as references to define the gate for zero ER-phagy events. Following stimulation, ER-phagy detection is based on the shift of cell population into the ER-phagy gate. On average, 5 to 10,000 cells were analyzed per condition and all statistical analyses were performed using data from at least three biological replicates.
RNA extraction was performed using Directzol RNA miniprep kit (Zymo Research) according to manufacturer’s instruction. 1μg of RNA per sample were used for reverse transcription using SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s instruction. qRT-PCR reaction was set up using Fast SYBR Green Mastermix (Applied Biosystems) and run in triplicates using StepOne Plus Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). A complete list of all primers used are compiled in Table S6 .
To prepare samples for western blot, cells were lysed in Radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (0.5M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1.5M NaCl, 2.5% deoxycholic acid, 10% NP-40, 10mM EDTA), supplemented with Halt Protease Inhibitor Cocktail and Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail (both ThermoFisher). Cells were lysed on ice for 10 minutes and spun at 14000 rpm for 10 minutes to remove insoluble debris. Protein concentrations were quantified by Bradford assay. Lysates were normalized based on protein concentration and NuPage LDS Sample Buffer (4x) supplemented with B-mercaptoethanol (5% v/v) was added (Invitrogen). Samples were boiled at 98°C for 5 minutes.
Between 20-40μg of samples were run on NuPAGE Bis-Tris 4%–12% gels in NuPage MES SDS Buffer (Invitrogen) for 40 minutes at 200 V and transferred to 0.4-μm nitrocellulose membranes using a semi-dry transfer system (Bio-Rad Catalog #1704150) at 1.3 A and 25 V for 15 minutes. After transfer, membranes were blocked with 5% (w/v) milk in Tris buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T) for 30 minutes, and subsequently washed with TBS-T three times. Primary antibodies were diluted at the appropriate concentration in 5% BSA (w/v) in TBS-T. The membrane was incubated in primary antibody for either 1-2 hours at room temperature or overnight at 4°C. The membrane was washed with TBS-T three times for five minutes each. The blots were incubated for 30 minutes in the milk solution with a 1:10,000 dilution of Li-Cor near-infrared fluorescence secondary antibodies. The blots were scanned using Li-Cor’s Near-InfraRed fluorescence Odyssey CLx Imaging System, and densitometry quantifications were done using Li-Cor’s ImageStudio software complementary of Odyssey.
Unless specified otherwise, all immunoprecipitation experiments were performed in HCT116 cells stably-expressing the different HA-tagged UFMylation protein constructs using the Perice Anti-HA Magnetic beads Kits according to manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, cells were harvested and lysed using the IP-lysis buffer supplemented with Halt Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (ThermoFisher). Equal amount of lysates (∼5mg) for each condition were mixed with pre-washed 50μl of HA-magnetic bead slurry. Immunoprecipitation was performed at 4’C for 2hr. The beads were then washed twice using ‘high-salt’ IP lysis buffer (IP lysis buffer supplemented with 500mM NaCl), with 5min incubation on a rotor. The final wash was performed using regular IP lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted by boiling the samples at 98’C in 1x NuPAGE LDS Sample Buffer (ThermoFisher) for 5min supplemented with NU-PAGE sample reducing agent.
HEK293T cells with either DDRGK1 knockout or DDRGK1 and UFSP2 double knockout were transiently transfected with pRK5-HA-UFM1-dCS for 72hr. Cells were then starved for 4hr in the presence of folimycin (50nM) and lysed using 1X RIPA lysis buffer supplemented with mammalian protease inhibitor for 10min on ice. Insoluble debris and nuclear fractions were removed by centrifugation. The samples were then denatured using final 2% SDS and boiled for 5min at 95°C. After denaturation, the samples were further diluted at 1:20 in 1X RIPA lysis buffer to dilute the SDS concentration to 0.1% prior to immunoprecipitation using anti-HA magnetic beads (Pierce, #88837). Immunoprecipitation was performed at room temperature for 1hr with constant rotation followed by two washes in high-salt RIPA buffer containing 500mM NaCl and a final wash in 1x RIPA buffer.
The immunoprecipitation samples were then processed by the Proteomics group of Functional Genomics Center Zurich (FGCZ) for on-bead tryptic digestion and mass spectrometry analysis. Briefly, beads were washed twice with 50ul of digestion buffer (10 mM Tris/2 mM CaCl 2 , pH 8.2). Then, 45μl of digestion buffer and 5μl trypsin (100 ng/ul in 10 mM HCl) were added and samples were microwaved to assist digestion (30 min at 60°C). The supernatant was collected and peptides were extracted from beads with 150ul of 0.1%TFA/50% acetonitrile. Supernatants were then combined and dried, dissolved in 20μl 0.1% formic acid and further diluted 1:10 in 0.1% formic acid and transferred to autosampler vials for LC/MS/MS. Database searches were performed using the Mascot search engine against SwissProt (all species and only human).
Immunofluorescence was conducted as previously described ( Liang et al., 2018 48. Liang, J.R. ∙ Lingeman, E. ∙ Ahmed, S. ... Atlastins remodel the endoplasmic reticulum for selective autophagy J. Cell Biol. 2018; 217 :3354-3367 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, cells were fixed in 4% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde for 15 min followed by permeabilization using 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. Cells were then blocked in 1% BSA in PBS for 20 min. Primary antibodies were incubated for 1hr at room temperature, followed by three PBS washes for 5min each. Alexa Fluor 488/568/660-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies were incubated for 30 min at room temperature, followed by three PBS washes for 5min each. Coverslips were mounted onto glass slides using ProLong Gold Antifade reagent with or without DAPI addition for nucleus visualization. Images were taken using either Zeiss LSM 710 Axio Observer (in Berkeley) or Leica TCS SP8 confocal microscope (in ETH Zurich) with 63x objective lens and post-processed in Adobe Photoshop for specific inset enlargement and RGB channel separation. Colocalization analysis in Figure 6 J was determined by Pearson’s Correlation coefficient using ImageJ with colocalization plugin from McMaster Biophotonics Facility (MBF). The frequency scatterplot in Figure S6 A was generated using the same plugin.
The MitoTracker assay was performed according the manufacturer’s protocol (ThermoFisher Catalog #M7512). Cells were plated 48 hours before starvation. Cell starvation and drug concentrations was performed according to protocols described above. The MitoTracker Red CMXRos was dissolved in DMSO for a stock concentration of 1 mM. MitoTracker was added to samples such that the concentration in each well was 50 nM. The cells were incubated for 30 minutes, washed with media, and then fixed in 4% formaldehyde. The cells were stained with calnexin according to the immunofluorescence protocol. For flow cytometry measurement, the experiment was performed the same way as mentioned above but the cells were trypsinized after incubation with MitoTracker dye to measure the fluorescence intensity of the staining.
The assay was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol for the CellTiter-Glo 2.0 Cell Viability Assay (Promega; Cat #: G9241). Briefly, the cells treated with starvation were starved for 25 hours. The cells treated with rotenone or antimycin A were used as positive controls and cells were treated for 1 hour. Cells were harvested, washed with PBS, and counted and normalized. The cells were spun down again and resuspended such that there were 25,000 cells per 50 μL of PBS. 50 μL of PBS was added to each well in an opaque-walled 96-well plate. Each sample was done in technical triplicate. Wells with PBS, but no cells, were used as a blank control. 50 μL of CellTiter-Glo 2.0 reagent was added to each well. The plate was placed on an orbital shake for 2 minutes, followed by a 10 minute bench-top incubation to stabilize the signal. Sample luminescence was determined by the SpectraMax M2 Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices).
Mitochondrial activity was determined using the Seahorse Flux Analyzer XF24 (Agilent Technology) and the Seahorse XF Cell Mito Stress Test Kit (Agilent; Cat. #:103015-100) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, 4 X 10 4 HCT1 16 cells were seeded on XF24-well cell culture microplates. After 24hr, growth medium was exchanged with XF assay base medium supplemented with 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen; Cat. #11360-070), 2mM L-glutamine (Invitrogen; Cat. #25030-081), and 10mM D-glucose (pH 7.4) (Invitrogen; Cat. #:D16-500). The microplates were incubated at 37°C without CO 2 for 1hr prior to the assay. Samples were mixed for 3 min, time delayed for 2 min, and measured for 3 min. Oligomycin (1 μM), FCCP (1 μM), and rotenone / antimycin (0.5 μM) were sequentially injected at the indicated time points. OCR data were normalized by protein concentration and the average values were taken for each experiment. Seven replicates were performed for each cell line. The mean ± SEM was determined and statistical significance was evaluated using the Student’s t test with a P value < 0.05.
All analysis was performed using data from at least three independent biological replicates (exact number of replicates are stated in the figure legend). Unless stated otherwise, all statistical analyses were performed in PRISM6 software using paired Student’s t test. P values are indicated as follow: ∗ < 0.05, ∗∗ < 0.01, ∗∗∗ < 0.001, ∗∗∗∗ < 0.0001. The distribution of the data was assumed to be normal, but this was not formally tested.
