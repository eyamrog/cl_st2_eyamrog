Title: Inactivation of a wheat protein kinase gene confers broad-spectrum resistance to rust fungi


Abstract: Summary

Wheat crops are frequently devastated by pandemic stripe rust caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici ( Pst ). Here, we identify and characterize a wheat receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase gene, TaPsIPK1 , that confers susceptibility to this pathogen. PsSpg1, a secreted fungal effector vital for Pst virulence, can bind TaPsIPK1, enhance its kinase activity, and promote its nuclear localization, where it phosphorylates the transcription factor TaCBF1d for gene regulation. The phosphorylation of TaCBF1d switches its transcriptional activity on the downstream genes. CRISPR-Cas9 inactivation of TaPsIPK1 in wheat confers broad-spectrum resistance against Pst without impacting important agronomic traits in two years of field tests. The disruption of TaPsIPK1 leads to immune priming without constitutive activation of defense responses. Taken together, TaPsIPK1 is a susceptibility gene known to be targeted by rust effectors, and it has great potential for developing durable resistance against rust by genetic modifications.

Section: Introduction

Wheat stripe rust, also known as yellow rust, is a disease caused by the fungus Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici ( Pst ) that can devastate wheat crops ( McIntosh et al., 1995 42. McIntosh, R.A. ∙ Wellings, C.R. ∙ Park, R.F. Wheat rusts: an atlas of resistance genes CSIRO Publishing, 1995 Google Scholar ; Ellis et al., 2014 12. Ellis, J.G. ∙ Lagudah, E.S. ∙ Spielmeyer, W. ... The past, present and future of breeding rust resistant wheat Front. Plant Sci. 2014; 5 :641 Crossref Scopus (382) PubMed Google Scholar ). Most wheat-producing regions are vulnerable to this disease, and destructive pandemics across the world have been recently reported ( Hovmøller et al., 2010 20.

The most effective way to control rust diseases is by planting and breeding durable resistant wheat cultivars ( Ellis et al., 2014 12. Ellis, J.G. ∙ Lagudah, E.S. ∙ Spielmeyer, W. ... The past, present and future of breeding rust resistant wheat Front. Plant Sci. 2014; 5 :641 Crossref Scopus (382) PubMed Google Scholar ). Conventional breeding for disease-resistant crop plants takes advantage of disease resistance ( R ) genes. The caveat of R gene-dependent disease resistance is the frequent loss of effectiveness due to pathogen mutations that allow evasion of detection by immune receptors ( Chen et al., 2014 7. Chen, W. ∙ Wellings, C. ∙ Chen, X. ... Wheat stripe (yellow) rust caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici Mol. Plant Pathol. 2014; 15 :433-446 Crossref Scopus (326) PubMed Google Scholar ).
An emerging approach to breeding durable resistance is the disruption of disease susceptibility ( S ) genes ( Pavan et al., 2010 46. Pavan, S. ∙ Jacobsen, E. ∙ Visser, R.G.F. ... Loss of susceptibility as a novel breeding strategy for durable and broad-spectrum resistance Mol. Breed. 2010; 25 :1-12 Crossref Scopus (264) PubMed Google Scholar ). S genes are host genes that are required for the virulence or pathogenicity of the pathogen ( Yang et al., 2006 60. Yang, B. ∙ Sugio, A. ∙ White, F.F. Os8N3 is a host disease-susceptibility gene for bacterial blight of rice Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103 :10503-10508 Crossref Scopus (489) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is thought that S gene products may be exploited by the pathogen for host recognition, penetration, nutrient acquisition, proliferation, and spread or for the inhibition of the host immune response ( Langner et al., 2018 31. Langner, T. ∙ Kamoun, S. ∙ Belhaj, K. CRISPR Crops: plant genome editing toward disease resistance Annu. Rev.

The disruption of host baseline susceptibility by inactivating S genes can confer disease resistance ( Li et al., 2012 34. Li, T. ∙ Liu, B. ∙ Spalding, M.H. ...

Plant. 2019; 12 :1434-1446 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (218) PubMed Google Scholar ). Yet, we are hampered by a lack of knowledge of key S genes that can be exploited for strong protection against pathogens without deleterious effects on the yield and growth of crop plants ( Wolter et al., 1993 58. Wolter, M. ∙ Hollricher, K. ∙ Salamini, F. ... The mlo resistance alleles to powdery mildew infection in barley trigger a developmentally controlled defence mimic phenotype Mol. Gen.

Simultaneous modification of three homoeologs of TaEDR1 by genome editing enhances powdery mildew resistance in wheat Plant J. 2017; 91 :714-724 Crossref Scopus (369) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Here, we identified a wheat Ser/Thr kinase gene, TaPsIPK1 ( Puccinia striiformis-Induced Protein Kinase 1 ), as a susceptibility gene that is vital for the virulence of Pst . The inactivation of TaPsIPK1 in hexaploid wheat leads to broad-spectrum resistance to Pst races endemic in China in 2020 and 2021 with no fitness or yield cost in the field. Furthermore, we showed that TaPsIPK1 was targeted by effector PsSpg1 that was secreted by Pst into host cells. PsSpg1 is required for Pst virulence in a TaPsIPK1-dependent manner. Association with PsSpg1 stimulated the auto-phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of TaPsIPK1. In the nucleus, TaPsIPK1 phosphorylates the transcription factor TaCBF1d as one of its substrates for regulating gene expression. Interestingly, the disruption of TaPsIPK1 primes pathogen-induced immune responses without constitutive defense activation. Hence, as a wheat susceptibility gene targeted by rust effectors, TaPsIPK1 is an ideal target for engineering broad-spectrum resistance to one of the most damaging diseases in wheat.

Section: Results

Among the genes differentially expressed in Pst -infected wheat leaves, 24 of them encode protein kinases ( Ma et al., 2009 40. Ma, J.B. ∙ Huang, X.L. ∙ Wang, X.J. ... Identification of expressed genes during compatible interaction between stripe rust ( Puccinia striiformis ) and wheat using a cDNA library BMC Genomics. 2009; 10 :586 Crossref Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar ). TaPsIPK1 ( Puccinia striiformis-Induced Protein Kinase 1 ), a member of the RLCK VII family, is induced by Pst infection ( Figures S1 A–S1D). The transient and stable silencing of the three homoeologs TaPsIPK1-6A , TaPsIPK1-6B , and TaPsIPK1-6D significantly decreased the susceptibility of wheat cultivars to Pst ( Figures S1 E–S1P), indicating its negative contribution to wheat stripe rust resistance.
To further investigate the function of TaPsIPK1 in susceptibility to stripe rust, we generated transgenic wheat lines overexpressing TaPsIPK1-6A ( TaPsIPK1 OE), which is highly induced upon Pst infection in Fielder. The T2 generation of TaPsIPK1 OE#L5 and #L13 had 5.9- and 3.8-fold increases in the transcript level of TaPsIPK1 , respectively ( Figure 1 A). When inoculated with the avirulent Pst race CYR23, Fielder plants developed a typical hypersensitive response (HR) and showed no obvious urediniospore pustules, whereas TaPsIPK1 OE#L5 and #L13 plants developed a large number of urediniospore pustules and had 69.9% and 58.2% increase in fungal biomass, respectively ( Figures 1 B and 1C). These data indicate that the overexpression of TaPsIPK1 is sufficient to break down resistance against an avirulent Pst race. Taken together with the resistance conferred by TaPsIPK1 silencing, TaPsIPK1 appears to function as a negative regulator of immunity to stripe rust in wheat.
To inactivate all three TaPsIPK1 homoeologs in the wheat genome by CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, we fused three guide RNAs (gRNAs) targeting the conserved regions in exons 2 and 3 with the wheat Ubiquitin 6 (wU6) promoter ( Figure S2 A). One mutant line, TaPsIPK1 KO, was obtained in which all three TaPsIPK1 homoeologs contained deletions or insertions leading to frameshift mutations in the targeted region ( Figures S2 B–S2D). When inoculated with the predominant Pst races CYR32, CYR33, and CYR34, TaPsIPK1 KO plants exhibited a strong HR and only had a few scattered urediniospore pustules ( Figure 1 D). The fungal biomass of CYR32, CYR33, and CYR34 was 48.1%, 60.8%, and 40.9% less than on Fielder plants, respectively ( Figure 1 E). These data confirm that the loss of TaPsIPK1 dramatically improves wheat resistance to Pst .
To study the characteristics of the resistance caused by the knockout of TaPsIPK1 in wheat, we examined the host cell defense response and fungal growth in Pst CYR32-infected TaPsIPK1 KO. Upon Pst infection, TaPsIPK1 KO plants accumulated more H 2 O 2 and showed increased cell death ( Figures 1 F–1H). To determine whether the observed necrotic cell death is a genuine ETI-associated HR, we assayed cell death and H 2 O 2 levels when challenged with the avirulent Pst race CYR23. Cell death detected by trypan blue staining occurred earlier in TaPsIPK1 KO (at 18 hours post inoculation [hpi]) than in Fielder (24 hpi) ( Figure S2 E). TaPsIPK1 KO plants also had higher H 2 O 2 contents than Fielder ( Figure S2 F). Interestingly, on the leaves of Fielder, Pst forms only one substomatal vesicle per stoma from the penetration peg, and on the leaves of TaPsIPK1 KO, multiple vesicles were formed underneath individual stoma at approximately half of the infection sites ( Figures S2 G and S2H). Additionally, the size of infection areas at 120 hpi was reduced in the knockout line ( Figure S2 I). These results indicate that the knockout of TaPsIPK1 promotes the occurrence of HR and alters Pst growth and development during infection.
In previous studies, improving disease resistance by the modification of host defense negative regulator genes has often been accompanied by a significant cost in terms of plant growth and yield, limiting their applications in resistance breeding ( Langner et al., 2018 31. Langner, T. ∙ Kamoun, S. ∙ Belhaj, K. CRISPR Crops: plant genome editing toward disease resistance Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 2018; 56 :479-512 Crossref Scopus (187) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zaidi et al., 2018 62. Zaidi, S.S.E.A. ∙ Mukhtar, M.S. ∙ Mansoor, S. Genome editing: targeting susceptibility genes for plant disease resistance Trends Biotechnol. 2018; 36 :898-906 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (217) PubMed Google Scholar ). We assessed the effect of TaPsIPK1 knockout on the key agronomic traits of wheat including thousand-grain weight, heading date, tiller number, and plant height in the greenhouse. The wheat growth, yield, and other agronomic traits were similar between TaPsIPK1 KO and Fielder ( Figures S2 J–S2L), indicating that the inactivation of TaPsIPK1 does not have an obvious impact on the major agronomic traits of wheat.
We further evaluated the resistance of TaPsIPK1 KO plants to Pst in the field in 2020 and 2021 by inoculating with a mixture of the prevalent Pst races in China. In both years, TaPsIPK1 KO was much more resistant to Pst than Fielder in the stripe rust disease nursery field ( Figures 2 A and S2 M). In 2020, the disease severity of Fielder was 84.6%, whereas the disease severity of TaPsIPK1 KO was 7.4% ( Figure 2 B) when assayed according to the stripe rust disease response grading standard in field trials ( Wellings and Bariana, 2004 55. Wellings, C. ∙ Bariana, H. Assessment scale for recording stripe rust responses in field trials. Plant breeding institute cereal rust laboratory. Cereal Rust Report Season 2004 Plant Breeding Institute-Cereal Rust Laboratory, University of Sydney. 2004; 2 :1-2 Google Scholar ). In 2021, the disease severity of TaPsIPK1 KO was 6.3% compared with 71.6% for Fielder ( Figure S2 N). Results from these field tests demonstrate that the resistance mediated by TaPsIPK1 knockout is effective in protection against wheat stripe rust in natural settings.
Importantly, the increased resistance of TaPsIPK1 KO plants to Pst did not compromise yield in the field ( Figure 2 C). No significant difference in the tiller number, ear length, or plant height was observed between the uninfected field-grown TaPsIPK1 KO and Fielder plants ( Figures 2 D–F and S2 O–Q). Without Pst inoculation, the thousand-grain weight of TaPsIPK1 KO plants was the same as that of Fielder, and in field lots inoculated with Pst , TaPsIPK1 KO plants had no obvious changes in yield, but yield loss in Fielder was 15.6% and 10.7% in 2020 and 2021, respectively ( Figures 2 G and S2 R). Thus, the inactivation of the TaPsIPK1 gene preserves wheat yield from damage caused by stripe rust disease.
The inactivation of genes encoding negative regulators usually leads to spontaneous immune responses, resulting in poor plant growth and yield ( Zaidi et al., 2018 62. Zaidi, S.S.E.A. ∙ Mukhtar, M.S. ∙ Mansoor, S. Genome editing: targeting susceptibility genes for plant disease resistance Trends Biotechnol. 2018; 36 :898-906 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (217) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, TaPsIPK1 knockout mutants did not exhibit any apparent developmental defects in the absence of the pathogen ( Figure S3 A). When stained with trypan blue, no obvious cell death was observed in the leaves of TaPsIPK1 KO, and the baseline H 2 O 2 content was similar to that of Fielder ( Figures S3 B and S3C), suggesting that the alteration in the defense caused by TaPsIPK1 knockout may be subtle in the absence of Pst infection.
To further evaluate host defense in TaPsIPK1 KO plants, we measured the expression of select pathogenesis-related genes ( PRs ) and found higher basal and Pst- induced expression levels of TaPR1 and TaPR5 compared with Fielder ( Figures S3 D and S3E). Consistent with these observations, free salicylic acid (SA) levels in uninfected and Pst- infected TaPsIPK1 KO were higher than those in Fielder ( Figure S3 F). These results suggest that elevated defense gene expression, possibly caused by SA accumulation, occurs in TaPsIPK1 KO plants.
PBL13 , a homolog of TaPsIPK1 in Arabidopsis , functions as a negative regulator in PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI) signaling ( Lin et al., 2015 36. Lin, Z.J. ∙ Liebrand, T.W. ∙ Yadeta, K.A. ... PBL13 is a serine/threonine protein kinase that negatively regulates Arabidopsis immune responses Plant Physiol. 2015; 169 :2950-2962 PubMed Google Scholar ). We therefore analyzed the involvement of TaPsIPK1 in PTI. Chitin treatment induced TaPsIPK1 expression in Fielder and accelerated induction of PTI marker genes in TaPsIPK1 KO ( Figures S3 G–S3K). Chitin treatment also resulted in accelerated MAPK activation, another hallmark of PTI ( Asai et al., 2002 2. Asai, T. ∙ Tena, G. ∙ Plotnikova, J. ... MAP kinase signalling cascade in Arabidopsis innate immunity Nature. 2002; 415 :977-983 Crossref Scopus (2175) PubMed Google Scholar ), with phospho-MAPK being detectable at 10 min after chitin treatment in TaPsIPK1 KO but not in Fielder ( Figure S3 L). In the absence of chitin treatment, however, the expression of these PTI response genes and MAPK activation were comparable to that of Fielder ( Figures S3 H–S3L), indicating that PTI responses were not constitutively activated in TaPsIPK1 KO plants. Together, these data suggest that TaPsIPK1 attenuates the PAMP-triggered expression of defense genes and delays MAPK activation, and mutation in TaPsIPK1 primes PTI.
As TaPsIPK1 KO plants show decreased susceptibility to virulent Pst , elevated PTI defenses, and increased HR and H 2 O 2 production upon infection, it is likely that TaPsIPK1 contributes to disease susceptibility by negatively regulating plant defense. In some cases, such host immune regulators are actively targeted by pathogen effectors to promote parasitism ( Garcia-Ruiz et al., 2021 15. Garcia-Ruiz, H. ∙ Szurek, B. ∙ Van den Ackerveken, G. Stop helping pathogens: engineering plant susceptibility genes for durable resistance Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2021; 70 :187-195 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ). To test this possibility, we attempted to identify candidate interactors of TaPsIPK1 by screening a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) cDNA library generated from Pst -infected wheat leaves using TaPsIPK1 as a bait. Twenty-six candidate binding proteins were identified, including 3 Pst proteins and 23 wheat proteins. Among the three Pst proteins, only PsSpg1 was confirmed to interact with TaPsIPK1 in further Y2H assays ( Figure S4 A). We further confirmed the interaction of PsSpg1 with TaPsIPK1 by split luciferase complementation assay (SLC) and co-immunoprecipitation (coIP) in Nicotiana benthamiana ( Figures 3 A–3C).
As there is currently no method to transform Pst , we generated a construct expressing a fusion of PsSpg1 and GFP with a nuclear localization sequence (NLS; PsSpg1 NLS -GFP) and transformed it into the fungus Fusarium graminearum strain PH-1, another wheat pathogen, to determine whether PsSpg1 could be secreted and delivered into plant cells. The Magnaporthe oryzae biotrophy-associated secreted protein 1 (Bas1), known to translocate into rice cells ( Khang et al., 2010 27. Khang, C.H. ∙ Berruyer, R. ∙ Giraldo, M.C. ... Translocation of Magnaporthe oryzae effectors into rice cells and their subsequent cell-to-cell movement Plant Cell. 2010; 22 :1388-1403 Crossref Scopus (347) PubMed Google Scholar ), was used as a positive control. GFP fluorescence was observed in the nuclei of wheat coleoptile cells infected with F. graminearum expressing PsSpg1 NLS -GFP similar to that with the positive control Bas1 NLS -GFP, whereas no fluorescence was seen when expressing NLS -GFP ( Figure S4 B). The localization of PsSpg1 NLS -GFP to the host cell nucleus supported that PsSpg1 can indeed be secreted and function as an intracellular effector.
PsSpg1 is conserved among Pst races and is highly induced at the early stage of Pst infection ( Table S1 ; Figure S4 C). To investigate the requirement for PsSpg1 in Pst infection of wheat, we employed host-induced gene silencing to generate two stable PsSpg1 RNAi wheat lines. PsSpg1 RNAi#L7 and #L12 plants were inoculated with Pst races CYR32, CYR33, and CYR34. When compared with the susceptible Fielder, PsSpg1 RNAi lines exhibited a significant HR and had few to no urediniospore pustules, indicative of broad-spectrum resistance ( Figure 3 D). PsSpg1 transcripts in L7 and L12 leaves at 24 hpi were reduced by 57.2%–87.8% compared with Fielder, depending on the Pst race used for infection ( Figure 3 E). At 14 days post inoculation (dpi), the Pst biomass was 35.8%–64.6% less in the PsSpg1 RNAi lines than in the Fielder ( Figure 3 F). These results were confirmed in the advanced generation of PsSpg1 RNAi lines ( Figures S4 D–S4F). Collectively, these data demonstrate that PsSpg1 is an intracellular effector required for the virulence of Pst .
Homologs of PsSpg1 also are present in P. Graminis (PgSpg1) and P. Triticina (PtSpg1), and they share a conserved C-terminal region and an N-terminal variable region ( Figure S4 G). PtSpg1 interacted with TaPsIPK1, whereas PgSpg1 did not by Y2H, SLC, and coIP assays ( Figures 3 A–3C and S4 A). The loss of function of TaPsIPK1 confers resistance to Ptt but not Pgt ( Figures S4 H–S4J). These findings support the hypothesis that PsSpg1 and PtSpg1, but not PgSpg1, promote Pst and Ptt virulence by interacting with TaPsIPK1.
To further test this possibility, PsSpg1 was transiently overexpressed using BSMV in the Fielder and TaPsIPK1 KO leaves, followed by inoculation with Pst CYR31. Increased Pst biomass and pustule formation were observed in Fielder plants transiently expressing PsSpg1 -GFP compared with those expressing GFP alone, indicating that the overexpression of PsSpg1 further enhanced Pst virulence ( Figures 3 G and 3H). On TaPsIPK1 KO, however, few pustules were observed regardless of transient PsSpg1 -GFP overexpression ( Figure 3 G), which also had no effect on Pst biomass ( Figure 3 H). We then assessed the ability of PsSpg1 to increase virulence in plants overexpressing TaPsIPK1 using PgSpg1 as the negative control. More pustules and more Pst biomass were observed in TaPsIPK1 OE plants transiently expressing PsSpg1 -GFP compared with that expressing GFP, while PgSpg1-GFP did not cause significant change ( Figures 3 I and 3J). Thus, we conclude that PsSpg1 functions as an intracellular effector to promote wheat susceptibility to Pst via its interaction with TaPsIPK1.
An in vitro kinase assay using GST-TaPsIPK1-His detected the phosphorylation of TaPsIPK1, suggesting the auto-phosphorylation of TaPsIPK1 ( Figure 4 A). We next tested whether the interaction between PsSpg1 and TaPsIPK1 could affect the auto-phosphorylation of TaPsIPK1, using PgSpg1 as the negative control, which does not interact with TaPsIPK1. An in vitro kinase assay with an increasing concentration of recombinant GST-PsSpg1 added to GST-TaPsIPK1-His revealed an increased level of phosphorylation of TaPsIPK1 in proportion to the amount of GST-PsSpg1 protein added, but not when GST-PgSpg1 was added ( Figure 4 A). Consistent with this, the co-expression of GFP-PsSpg1 and HA-TaPsIPK1 in N. benthamiana resulted in an additional peak of HA-TaPsIPK1 chemiluminescence (isoelectric point, pI = 6.042) detected by the NanoPro immunoassay ( Figures S4 K and S4L), which was abolished by treatment with alkaline phosphatase. These results together suggest that the kinase activity of TaPsIPK is increased by PsSpg1.
To determine the localization of TaPsIPK1, we co-expressed TaPsIPK1-GFP with a plasma membrane (PM) marker TaWPI6-mCherry ( Koike et al., 2005 28. Koike, M. ∙ Sutoh, K. ∙ Kawakami, A. ... Molecular characterization of a cold-induced plasma membrane protein gene from wheat Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2005; 274 :445-453 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ) in N. benthamiana . Considerable overlap in the GFP and mCherry signals was observed, indicating a PM localization of TaPsIPK1 ( Figure S4 M). In cells co-expressing PsSpg1-mCherry and TaPsIPK1-GFP, GFP signals were observed at the PM and in the nucleus, whereas mCherry signals were only in the cytoplasm ( Figure S4 N). In cells co-expressing PgSpg1-mCherry and TaPsIPK1-GFP, GFP signals were observed only at the PM ( Figure S4 N). In cells co-expressing HA-PsSpg1 and TaPsIPK1-GFP, 76% of GFP signals were found in the nucleus ( Figure S4 O). These findings were corroborated by cell fractionation and immunoblotting ( Figure S4 P). Thus, the interaction of TaPsIPK1 with PsSpg1 promotes its translocation from the PM into the nucleus, which is not accompanied by their continued binding.
To test whether PsSpg1 can promote the nuclear entry of TaPsIPK1 in wheat plants, we examined TaPsIPK1 in nuclear extracts of TaPsIPK1 OE transgenic wheat leaves transiently expressing PsSpg1-GFP, PgSpg1-GFP , or GFP . Little TaPsIPK1-HA protein was detected in the nuclear extracts of GFP -expressing leaves ( Figure 4 B). However, in leaves co-expressing PsSpg1, we detected a strong accumulation of TaPsIPK1-HA in the nucleus, as well as a mild increase in nuclear TaPsIPK1 accumulation upon co-expression of PgSpg1 ( Figure 4 B). These results were consistent with the TaPsIPK1 localization data in N. benthamiana . Taken together, our data confirm that the presence of PsSpg1 can drive the nuclear entry of TaPsIPK1.
To determine whether the nuclear entry of TaPsIPK1 contributes to host susceptibility, we transiently expressed TaPsIPK1 carrying NLS from the SV40 virus (PKKKRKV) ( Kalderon et al., 1984 25. Kalderon, D. ∙ Richardson, W.D. ∙ Markham, A.F. ... Sequence requirements for nuclear location of simian virus 40 large-T antigen Nature. 1984; 311 :33-38 Crossref Scopus (1017) PubMed Google Scholar ) and TaPsIPK1 carrying NES sequence (NELALKLAGLDINK) from PKI ( Wen et al., 1995 57. Wen, W. ∙ Meinkoth, J.L. ∙ Tsien, R.Y. ... Identification of a signal for rapid export of proteins from the nucleus Cell. 1995; 82 :463-473 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1024) PubMed Google Scholar ) in TaPsIPK1 KO plants and then inoculated with Pst race CYR31. Fourteen days post Pst infection, plants expressing TaPsIPK NLS produced more pustules compared with plants expressing GFP ( Figure 4 C), indicating that accumulation of nuclear TaPsIPK1 could increase Pst virulence. In contrast, TaPsIPK1 KO plants expressing TaPsIPK1 NES produced few pustules that were similar to plants expressing GFP ( Figure 4 C). These results were further corroborated with Pst biomass assays ( Figure 4 D). These results indicated that nuclear localization of TaPsIPK1 is required for conferring wheat susceptibility to Pst .
Among the 23 TaPsIPK1-interacting wheat proteins identified by Y2H assay, two of them have predicted NLS sequences, a CCAAT-binding transcription factor locating at wheat chromosome 6D named TaCBF1d and a histone transcription factor. Both of them were tested and TaCBF1d, and its homoeologs were confirmed to interact with TaPsIPK1 by Y2H assay ( Figures 5 A and S5 A). The interaction was further verified by SLC, coIP, and pull-down assays ( Figures 5 B, S5 B, and S5C). To determine its function during Pst infection, we generated transgenic lines overexpressing TaCBF1d in cultivar Fielder. Two T2 lines, TaCBF1d OE#L12, and #L15, had 6- to 8-fold more TaCBF1d transcripts than Fielder ( Figure 5 C). In infection assays with Pst races CYR32, CYR33, and CYR34, numerous pustules were observed on the leaves of Fielder at 14 dpi ( Figure 5 D). Under the same condition, inoculated leaves of TaCBF1d OE plants showed a strong HR indicative of resistance ( Figure 5 D). The fungal biomass in TaCBF1d OE plants was reduced by 44.5%–68.0% ( Figure 5 E). Furthermore, H 2 O 2 accumulation was increased in TaCBF1d OE plants at 24 and 48 hpi ( Figures 5 F, S5 D, and S5E), which was consistent with HR in these plants.
To further characterize the role of TaCBF1d in stripe rust resistance, we created TaCBF1 RNAi wheat plants with the TaCBF1 genes stably silenced. The expression of TaCBF1 was down-regulated by 74.1% and 68.8% in the leaves of TaCBF1 RNAi#L7 and #L8, respectively ( Figure 5 G). Although Fielder inoculated with the avirulent Pst race CYR23 showed strong HR with no pustules, TaCBF1 RNAi lines developed sporadic urediniospore pustules and HR ( Figure 5 H). Fungal biomass was increased by 20.0% and 17.8% in TaCBF1 RNAi#L7 and #L8 plants, respectively, when compared with Fielder ( Figure 5 I), indicating that reduced TaCBF1 expression weakened the resistance of wheat to Pst . Together, the TaCBF1 transcription factor gene plays an important role in wheat resistance to Pst .
To compare the biological consequences of resistance conferred by PsSpg1 RNAi, TaPsIPK1 KO, and TaCBF1d OE, we performed RNA-sequencing and revealed 628 overlapping differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with similar expression patterns across these plants upon Pst infection ( Table S2 ). Interestingly, the Gene Ontology analysis showed that genes involved in sphingolipid metabolic process were enriched in the common DEGs ( Table S2 ). Sphingolipids are well known for their role in the regulation of programmed cell death ( Huby et al., 2020 21. Huby, E. ∙ Napier, J.A. ∙ Baillieul, F. ... Sphingolipids: towards an integrated view of metabolism during the plant stress response New Phytol. 2020; 225 :659-670 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is thus tempting to speculate that the altered expression of these genes may be related to the increased HR-like response when plants are challenged with virulent Pst , a possibility to be tested in the future.
To determine whether TaPsIPK1 directly phosphorylates TaCBF1d, recombinant GST-TaPsIPK1-His and GST-TaCBF1d-HA proteins isolated from E. coli were used for in vitro kinase assays. Phos-tag SDS-PAGE revealed the phosphorylated form of TaCBF1d proteins after co-incubation with GST-TaPsIPK1-His ( Figure S6 A). Phosphorylated TaCBF1d was also identified in N. bentamiana cells co-expressing GFP-TaCBF1d and HA-TaPsIPK1 by NanoPro immunoassay ( Figures S6 B and S6C). Thus, we conclude that TaPsIPK1 can phosphorylate TaCBF1d in vitro .
To examine whether PsSpg1 could affect the phosphorylation of TaCBF1d by TaPsIPK1, we next conducted the same in vitro kinase assay with or without recombinant GST-PsSpg1. Indeed, the increased phosphorylation of TaCBF1d was detected with the addition of PsSpg1, whereas the addition of PgSpg1 did not obviously change the phosphorylation of TaCBF1d ( Figure 6 A). We next asked whether Pst infection could enhance TaPsIPK1 kinase activity toward TaCBF1d. Total proteins from healthy and Pst- inoculated Fielder plants were separated in SDS-PAGE embedded with GST-TaCBF1d-HA recombinant protein and subjected to in-gel kinase assays. The phosphorylation of TaPsIPK1 was increased in Pst CYR31-infected Fielder compared with healthy plants, whereas no signal was detected in TaPsIPK1 KO plants ( Figure 6 B). These data suggested that the kinase activity of TaPsIPK1 toward the substrate TaCBF1d is enhanced by PsSpg1 and Pst infection.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) using TaCBF1-specific polyclonal antibodies was performed to identify genes targeted by TaCBF1. Promoter sequences of 97 genes were enriched among which 44 encode proteins with known functional annotation. Twenty-one genes with distinct known functions were further chosen for validation by ChIP-qPCR ( Table S3 ). The promoters of 17 of the 21 genes were significantly enriched compared with the control in which IgG was added, verifying the binding of TaCBF1 to these promoters ( Figure 6 C). We subsequently performed dual-luciferase reporter assays to detect the effect of TaCBF1d on the transcription of these 17 genes. First, we performed mass spectrometry to investigate the potential phosphorylation sites of TaCBF1d by TaPsIPK1 and found that Ser120, Ser142, Thr153, and Thr164 could be phosphorylated by TaPsIPK1 ( Figure S6 D). We replaced these Ser and Thr residues of TaCBF1d with Ala (A) to generate phospho-dead mutants. The in vitro phosphorylation assay showed that the phosphorylation of TaCBF1d by TaPsIPK1 was reduced to varying degrees among which when T164 was mutated to A, the phosphorylation was abolished ( Figure 6 D). These results suggest that T164 is a major site phosphorylated by TaPsIPK1. Thus, to assess the role of TaCBF1d phosphorylation on downstream gene regulation, we expressed TaCBF1d T164A (phospho-dead mutant) and TaCBF1d T164D (phospho-mimic mutant) as the effectors in dual-luciferase reporter assay. We tested 15 genes whose promoter sequences could be cloned. The results showed that transient expression of TaCBF1d T164D significantly reduced the expression of 10 genes, upregulated 3 genes, and the expression of 2 genes were not affected compared with TaCBF1d T164A ( Figure 6 E), suggesting that the phosphorylation level of TaCBF1d may affect its role in regulating the downstream gene transcription.
We further investigated the impact of PsSpg1 on TaCBF1d-mediated transcriptional regulation. Two genes, 139400 ( TaPsIPK1 ) and 227600 (vacuole-processing enzyme gene), which were activated and repressed by phospho-mimic TaCBF1d T164D , respectively, were tested in TaPsIPK1 OE wheat protoplasts using the dual-luciferase reporter assay. The results showed that TaCBF1d activates TaPsIPK1 expression, and this transcriptional activation is further promoted by PsSpg1, leading to a positive feedback loop ( Figures S6 E and S6F). In contrast, the transcriptional activation of 227600 by TaCBF1d is repressed in the presence of PsSpg1 ( Figures S6 E and S6G). These conclusions are further supported by qRT-PCR results showing increased TaPsIPK1 expression and decreased 227600 expression in Fielder expressing PsSpg1 compared with that in the controls, whereas the reversed expression pattern is observed in PsSpg1 RNAi plants ( Figures S6 H–S6K).

Section: Discussion

Despite the appeal of manipulating susceptibility ( S ) genes to create durable plant immunity to pathogens, there are few successful reports of desirable S gene discovery, with the exception of Mlo in wheat and SWEET genes in rice ( Wang et al., 2014 54. Wang, Y. ∙ Cheng, X. ∙ Shan, Q. ... Simultaneous editing of three homoeoalleles in hexaploid bread wheat confers heritable resistance to powdery mildew Nat.

Genome-edited powdery mildew resistance in wheat without growth penalties Nature. 2022; 602 :455-460 Crossref Scopus (206) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our identification of the RLCK TaPsIPK1 , gene editing of which confers broad-spectrum resistance to wheat rust disease without fitness cost in the field, is a successful report of S gene editing-mediated rust resistance for agronomic use.
Multiple lines of evidence indicate that TaPsIPK1 is an important S gene in wheat. Transient and stable silencing and the complete disruption of TaPsIPK1 in wheat lead to reduced susceptibility to multiple virulent races of Pst . PsSpg1 was identified as a TaPsIPK1-interacting protein. Host-induced gene silencing of PsSpg1 drastically reduced the virulence of multiple Pst races, whereas transient overexpression of PsSpg1 enhanced disease, which is dependent on the presence of TaPsIPK1 . Importantly, Spg1 proteins from Pst and P. triticina but not P. graminis can interact with TaPsIPK1, and this is associated with reduced susceptibility of TaPsIPK1 knockout plants to Pst and P. triticina , but not to P. graminis . Together, these results provide compelling evidence that TaPsIPK1 is an S gene specifically targeted by Spg1 from Pst and P. triticina .
To date, few regulators linked to wheat susceptibility have been successfully used in breeding resistance due to their pleiotropic effects on growth and yield, although many candidates have been identified ( Wang et al., 2014 54. Wang, Y. ∙ Cheng, X. ∙ Shan, Q. ... Simultaneous editing of three homoeoalleles in hexaploid bread wheat confers heritable resistance to powdery mildew Nat. Biotechnol. 2014; 32 :947-951 Crossref Scopus (1529) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhang et al., 2017 65. Zhang, Y. ∙ Bai, Y. ∙ Wu, G. ...

Langner, T. ∙ Kamoun, S. ∙ Belhaj, K. CRISPR Crops: plant genome editing toward disease resistance Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 2018; 56 :479-512 Crossref Scopus (187) PubMed Google Scholar ). CRISPR-Cas9 editing of Mlo and EDR1 led to strong and moderate resistance to powdery mildew in wheat, respectively ( Wang et al., 2014 54. Wang, Y. ∙ Cheng, X. ∙ Shan, Q. ... Simultaneous editing of three homoeoalleles in hexaploid bread wheat confers heritable resistance to powdery mildew Nat.

Simultaneous modification of three homoeologs of TaEDR1 by genome editing enhances powdery mildew resistance in wheat Plant J. 2017; 91 :714-724 Crossref Scopus (369) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, their loss of function usually leads to substantial fitness penalties such as spontaneous cell death in leaf mesophyll cells, increased Mlo- mediated susceptibility to M. grisea and Bipolaris sorokiana in barley ( Jarosch et al., 1999 23. Jarosch, B. ∙ Kogel, K.H. ∙ Schaffrath, U. The ambivalence of the barley Mlo Locus: mutations conferring resistance against powdery mildew ( Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei ) enhance susceptibility to the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea Mol. Plant Microbe Interact. 1999; 12 :508-514 Crossref Scopus (171) Google Scholar ; Kumar et al., 2001 29. Kumar, J. ∙ Hückelhoven, R. ∙ Beckhove, U. ... A compromised Mlo pathway affects the response of barley to the necrotrophic fungus Bipolaris sorokiniana (Teleomorph: Cochliobolus sativus ) and its toxins Phytopathol. 2001; 91 :127-133 Crossref Scopus (175) PubMed Google Scholar ), and the growth reduction of the Arabidopsis edr1 mutant ( Frye and Innes, 1998 14. Frye, C.A. ∙ Innes, R.W. An Arabidopsis mutant with enhanced resistance to powdery mildew Plant Cell. 1998; 10 :947-956 Crossref Scopus (259) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, we showed that the inactivation of TaPsIPK1 by CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing conferred resistance to all predominant epidemic races of Pst in the field in China, as well as to the leaf rust fungus P. triticina . Moreover, during the stripe rust pandemics of 2020 and 2021 in China, TaPsIPK1 KO plants maintained effective resistance to Pst populations with no impact on agronomic traits in the field. In contrast to the race-specific resistance mediated by dominant R genes, TaPsIPK1 disruption-mediated resistance is not race-specific, which provides excellent wheat germplasm for breeding durable resistance in wheat.
It is worth noting that PsSpg1 exists in all tested Pst races in our study, which might explain the broad-spectrum resistance conferred by the disruption of TaPsIPK1 . Interestingly, unlike the typical fungal effectors with a short N-terminal signal peptide ( Kamoun, 2006 26. Kamoun, S. A catalogue of the effector secretome of plant pathogenic oomycetes Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 2006; 44 :41-60 Crossref Scopus (605) PubMed Google Scholar ; Dou and Zhou, 2012 11. Dou, D. ∙ Zhou, J.M. Phytopathogen effectors subverting host immunity: different foes, similar battleground Cell Host Microbe. 2012; 12 :484-495 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (368) PubMed Google Scholar ), PsSpg1 encodes a secreted protein lacking any recognizable signal peptide. Our study showed that PsSpg1 could be translocated into host cells when heterologously expressed in F. graminearum , supporting that PsSpg1 is an intracellular effector. In addition to the well-studied conventionally secreted effectors, pathogen effectors that lack signal peptides have been described in fungal pathogens such as Verticillium dahliae and M. oryzae and the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora sojae ( Giraldo et al., 2013 16. Giraldo, M.C. ∙ Dagdas, Y.F. ∙ Gupta, Y.K. ... Two distinct secretion systems facilitate tissue invasion by the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae Nat. Commun. 2013; 4 :1996 Crossref Scopus (301) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhang and Xu, 2014 64. Zhang, S. ∙ Xu, J.R.

Unconventionally secreted effectors of two filamentous pathogens target plant salicylate biosynthesis Nat. Commun. 2014; 5 :4686 Crossref Scopus (277) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Susceptibility factors are usually hijacked by pathogen effectors via alteration of their stability, expression, and/or activity to promote disease development ( Boevink et al., 2016 4. Boevink, P.C. ∙ Wang, X. ∙ McLellan, H. ... A Phytophthora infestans RXLR effector targets plant PP1c isoforms that promote late blight disease Nat.

Ma, T. ∙ Chen, S. ∙ Liu, J. ... Plasmopara viticola effector PvRXLR111 stabilizes VvWRKY40 to promote virulence Mol. Plant Pathol. 2021; 22 :231-242 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the regulatory effectors employed by pathogens to manipulate susceptibility genes remain largely unknown, with no relevant reports on wheat. For example, for the best-characterized Mlo gene in crops, which was shown to confer resistance to powdery mildew seven decades ago ( Freisleben and Lein, 1942 13. Freisleben, R. ∙ Lein, A. Ber die auffindung einer mehltauresistenten Mutante nach rntgenbestrahlung einer anflligen reinen Linie von Sommergerste Sci. Nat. 1942; 30 :608 Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar ), the upstream effectors still have not been characterized. Here, we showed that PsSpg1 physically interacts with TaPsIPK1 and enhances its kinase activity on auto-phosphorylation and phosphorylation of TaCBF1d, suggesting that the TaPsIPK1 kinase may be part of an intracellular signaling pathway involved in defense. This would be consistent with the function of another RLCK VII subfamily member in Arabidopsis, BOTRYTIS-INDUCED KINASE1 (BIK1), which is an essential component linking the PAMP receptor complex to downstream intracellular signaling via phosphorylation ( Lu et al., 2010 39. Lu, D. ∙ Wu, S. ∙ Gao, X. ... A receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase, BIK1, associates with a flagellin receptor complex to initiate plant innate immunity Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107 :496-501 Crossref Scopus (614) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhang et al., 2010 63. Zhang, J. ∙ Li, W. ∙ Xiang, T. ... Receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases integrate signaling from multiple plant immune receptors and are targeted by a Pseudomonas syringae effector Cell Host Microbe. 2010; 7 :290-301 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (627) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lal et al., 2018 30. Lal, N.K. ∙ Nagalakshmi, U. ∙ Hurlburt, N.K. ... The receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase BIK1 localizes to the nucleus and regulates defense hormone expression during plant innate immunity Cell Host Microbe. 2018; 23 :485-497.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (87) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, the presence of PsSpg1 promotes the translocation of the TaPsIPK1 kinase to the nucleus, which is essential for TaPsIPK1-mediated wheat susceptibility to Pst . Thus, our finding of the effector PsSpg1 targeting TaPsIPK1 enriches our understanding of effector-triggered susceptibility in wheat- Pst interaction.
TaCBF1d phosphorylation by TaPsIPK, enhanced by PsSpg1, changes its regulatory activity on the downstream gene transcription. Phosphorylated TaCBF1d activates the transcription of TaPsIPK1 , which is strengthened in the presence of PsSpg1, suggesting a positive feedback loop. This feedback loop may effectively amplify the amount of TaPsIPK1 protein during Pst infection. The transcription of most detected target genes, however, is repressed by phosphorylated TaCBF1d, including those involved in chloroplast function, protein sorting, cell death, etc. The altered transcription of genes targeted by TaCBF1d suggests that the phosphorylation level of TaCBF1d is associated with its mode of regulation. Hence, the enhanced TaCBF1d phosphorylation by TaPsIPK1 and PsSpg1 might reprogram target gene expression to disturb plant defense response and thus facilitate pathogen infection.
The inactivation of TaPsIPK1 resulted in increased defense gene expression and H 2 O 2 production as well as effector-triggered immunity (ETI)-associated HR when challenged with virulent races of Pst . TaPsIPK1 KO plants also displayed more rapid induction of multiple defense genes and activation of MAPKs in PTI. These data suggest that TaPsIPK1 negatively affects both PTI and ETI. Although mechanisms by which RLCK VII members induce immunity are relatively well understood, how some negatively regulate immunity is not clear ( Lin et al., 2015 36. Lin, Z.J. ∙ Liebrand, T.W. ∙ Yadeta, K.A. ... PBL13 is a serine/threonine protein kinase that negatively regulates Arabidopsis immune responses Plant Physiol. 2015; 169 :2950-2962 PubMed Google Scholar ; Couto and Zipfel, 2016 8. Couto, D. ∙ Zipfel, C. Regulation of pattern recognition receptor signalling in plants Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2016; 16 :537-552 Crossref Scopus (859) PubMed Google Scholar ; Liang and Zhou, 2018 35. Liang, X. ∙ Zhou, J.M. Receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases: central players in plant receptor kinase-mediated signaling Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2018; 69 :267-299 Crossref Scopus (283) PubMed Google Scholar ). The fact that the reduction of Pst virulence by host-induced gene silencing of PsSpg1 and the reduction of wheat susceptibility by the disruption of TaPsIPK1 were both accompanied by HR suggests that, in the absence of these proteins, Pst is recognized by an unknown wheat R gene that can be suppressed by the targeting of TaPsIPK1 by PsSpg1. Importantly, PTI and ETI can mutually potentiate each other ( Yuan et al., 2021 61. Yuan, M.H. ∙ Jiang, Z.Y. ∙ Bi, G.Z. ... Pattern-recognition receptors are required for NLR-mediated plant immunity Nature. 2021; 592 :105-109 Crossref Scopus (601) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ngou et al., 2021 44. Ngou, B.P.M. ∙ Ahn, H.K. ∙ Ding, P.T. ... Mutual potentiation of plant immunity by cell-surface and intracellular receptors Nature. 2021; 592 :110-115 Crossref Scopus (526) PubMed Google Scholar ), which is consistent with our observation that TaPsIPK1 negatively affects both PTI and ETI. Future work is required to unravel the details of how TaPsIPK1 connects both PTI and ETI.
Given the effectiveness of TaPsIPK1 KO plants in resistance against Pst and Ptt in the field, this study offers a practical route to generate resistant wheat plants by the inactivation of susceptibility genes, and the TaPsIPK1 KO plants produced herein will be valuable resources for wheat breeding programs. Indeed, it will be particularly interesting to determine whether genetically manipulating multiple factors in this PsSpg1-TaPsIPK1-TaCBF1d cascade may further enhance this resistance and generate an even stronger starting material for agricultural use.
We show that wheat TaPsIPK1 is driven into the nucleus by the fungal pathogen effector PsSpg1 to confer susceptibility. However, it is unclear how TaPsIPK1 translocates into the nucleus. Additional work will be needed to fully elucidate the translocation pattern of TaPsIPK1. Another limitation of the study is the regulation of TaCBF1d transcriptional activity. Although we show that phosphorylation alters the transcriptional activity of TaCBF1d, the mechanism by which phosphorylation governs TaCBF1d transcriptional activity remains to be explored. Also, the contributions of downstream genes in the aforementioned defense or susceptibility need to be further investigated.

Wheat cultivars from two different backgrounds, Xinong 1376 (XN1376) and Suwon11 (Su11), were transformed to create the TaPsIPK1 RNAi lines. The wheat cultivar Fielder was used to create the TaPsIPK1 knockout ( TaPsIPK1 KO) mutant, TaPsIPK1 overexpression ( TaPsIPK1 OE) lines and PsSpg1 RNAi lines. The Su11 cultivar was used for in-wheat transient silencing by virus-induced gene silencing according to a previous report ( Holzberg et al., 2002 19. Holzberg, S. ∙ Brosio, P. ∙ Gross, C. ... Barley stripe mosaic virus-induced gene silencing in a monocot plant Plant J. 2002; 30 :315-327 Crossref Scopus (531) PubMed Google Scholar ). Fielder and TaPsIPK1 KO mutant plants were also used for the transient overexpression assay via viral transformation. All plants were grown in a growth room at 16°C with 16 h of light and at 14°C with 8 h of dark. For tillering and seed collection, the seeds of the plants of all backgrounds were vernalized at 4°C for 1 month or 1 week, respectively, and then were grown at 25°C with 16 h of light and at 20°C with 8 h of dark. Nicotiana benthamiana was grown at 23°C under 16 h light/8 h dark for transient expression assays.
The Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici ( Pst ) races CYR23, CYR31, CYR32, CYR33 and CYR34, Puccinia triticina f. sp. tritici ( Ptt ) race SHTK, and Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici ( Pgt ) (isolated single urediniospore from the field) were used for inoculation. The Pst race CYR23 was propagated on Mingxian169 (MX169) wheat, and the other rust fungal races were grown on Su11 wheat. The Pst and Ptt -inoculated wheat plants were incubated at 16°C with 16 h of light and at 14°C with 8 h of dark. The Pgt -inoculated wheat plants were incubated at 20°C with 16 h of light and at 16°C with 8 h of dark. Two weeks post inoculation, fresh Pst urediniospores were collected and stored at 4°C before inoculation.
For the RNAi construct, specific fragments of TaPsIPK1 (248 bp), PsSpg1 (137 bp) and TaCBF1 (162 bp) were amplified using the primers in Table S4 and inserted into the RNAi vector PC336 as inverted repeats to create the TaPsIPK1 RNAi, PsSpg1 RNAi and TaCBF1 RNAi recombinant vectors using Gateway technology. For construction of the TaPsIPK1 and TaCBF1d overexpression vector, the full-length coding sequences of TaPsIPK1 -HA and TaCBF1d-HA were inserted into the PANIC6E vector (with the bar gene conferring basta resistance) using Gateway technology. The recombinant constructs were transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain EHA105. The transgenic wheat lines were generated through Agrobacterium -mediated infiltration of immature wheat embryos as previously described ( Ishida et al., 2015 22. Ishida, Y. ∙ Tsunashima, M. ∙ Hiei, Y. ... Wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) transformation using immature embryos Methods Mol. Biol. 2015; 1223 :189-198 Crossref Scopus (199) PubMed Google Scholar ). The genomic DNA was extracted for PCR detection after the regeneration plants reached the third-leaf stage.
For editing TaPsIPK1 with CRISPR-Cas9, four candidate gRNAs targeting the three copies of TaPsIPK1 were designed, and their cutting efficiencies were assessed by exocleavage experiments. Three gRNAs exhibiting high efficiency (≥ 75%) were inserted into the vector VK005-05 to create the CRISPR-Cas9 vector, which contains the wheat U6 promoter and hygromycin B phosphotransferase gene (hyg resistance). The recombinant vector was transformed into the wheat cultivar Fielder using Agrobacterium -mediated transformation as described above. The positive transgenic seedlings were selected with hygromycin (100 mg·L -1 ), and genomic DNA was extracted for PCR detection of the Cas9 gene fragment, 35S promoter and hygromycin B phosphotransferase gene. All primers are shown in Table S4 .
To determine the function of TaPsIPK1 in the wheat- Pst interaction, we used BSMV-mediated gene silencing to knockdown the expression of TaPsIPK1 . Two fragments were used to silence TaPsIPK1 . Each of the BSMV constructs (BSMV: TaPsIPK1 -1as and BSMV: TaPsIPK1 -2as for silencing TaPsIPK1 , BSMV:γ as control and BSMV: TaPDS as a virus-positive control) was inoculated onto the second leaves as described previously ( Holzberg et al., 2002 19. Holzberg, S. ∙ Brosio, P. ∙ Gross, C. ... Barley stripe mosaic virus-induced gene silencing in a monocot plant Plant J. 2002; 30 :315-327 Crossref Scopus (531) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hein et al., 2005 18. Hein, I. ∙ Barciszewska-Pacak, M. ∙ Hrubikova, K. ... Virus-induced gene silencing-based functional characterization of genes associated with powdery mildew resistance in barley Plant Physiol. 2005; 138 :2155-2164 Crossref Scopus (214) PubMed Google Scholar ). The mock plants were treated with 1× Fes buffer as previously described ( Wang et al., 2011 53. Wang, X.J. ∙ Tang, C.L. ∙ Zhang, H. ... TaDAD2 , a negative regulator of programmed cell death, is important for the interaction between wheat and the stripe rust fungus Mol. Plant Microbe Interact. 2011; 24 :79-90 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ). The seedlings were moisturized at 100% relative humidity in darkness for 24 h and then placed in an incubator at 25°C for 9 days before the phenotype was analyzed. When the TaPDS silencing fragment infection sites showed the expected photobleaching phenotype, the fourth leaves were infected with freshly harvested urediniospores of the Pst race CYR31 or CYR23. The inoculated leaves were sampled at 0 hour for silencing efficiency assessment and at 14 days post inoculation (dpi) for fungal biomass evaluation. The phenotype of gene-silenced wheat plants was observed at 14 dpi. For PsSpg1 expression in Fielder and TaPsIPK1 KO plants, we inserted full-length PsSpg1 in the BSMV-VOX vector ( Lee et al., 2012 32. Lee, W.S. ∙ Hammond-Kosack, K.E. ∙ Kanyuka, K. Barley stripe mosaic virus-mediated tools for investigating gene function in cereal plants and their pathogens: virus-induced gene silencing, host-mediated gene silencing, and virus-mediated overexpression of heterologous protein Plant Physiol. 2012; 160 :582-590 Crossref Scopus (125) PubMed Google Scholar ). BSMV infection and Pst race CYR31 inoculation were performed as described above. At 14 dpi of Pst , the disease phenotype was observed, and the Pst -infected wheat leaves were sampled for fungal biomass evaluation. All inoculation experiments were repeated as three biological replicates.
For RT-qPCR, Pst CYR23 and CYR31 were used to inoculate the second leaves of two-week-old wheat seedlings. The inoculated wheat plants were moisturized in the dark at 16°C for 24 h and then placed in an incubator at 16°C under light and at 14°C in the dark with a 16 h light/8 h dark cycle. For the transient expression or silencing assay, the plants were inoculated with Pst races 7 days after BSMV infection. 14 days post Pst inoculation, the disease phenotype was observed and photographed.
For transgenic wheat lines, the Pst races CYR23, CYR31, CYR34, CYR32 and CYR33 were inoculated on the second leaves of two-week-old seedlings by the smear method ( Wang et al., 2007 52. Wang, C.F. ∙ Huang, L.L. ∙ Buchenauer, H. ... Histochemical studies on the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (O 2− and H 2 O 2 ) in the incompatible and compatible interaction of wheat- Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici . Physiol Mol. Plant. 2007; 71 :230-239 Google Scholar ). The inoculated leaves were collected at 0, 18, 24, 48 or 120 hpi for RNA extraction and histological observation. The disease phenotype was observed at 14 dpi. For field trial assays, TaPsIPK1 KO and Fielder seeds were grown in the experimental field of Northwest A&F University (Yangling, Shaanxi, China) under two distinct conditions: a stripe rust disease nursery field and a control field without stripe rust disease introduced. For nursery field pathogen infection, spray inoculation was performed with mixed Pst races (CYR32, CYR33 and CYR34), all of which are highly virulent and currently prevalent in China. For evaluation of disease severity, we calculated the scale of stripe rust severity according to the grading standard of wheat responses in field trial ( Wellings and Bariana, 2004 55. Wellings, C. ∙ Bariana, H. Assessment scale for recording stripe rust responses in field trials. Plant breeding institute cereal rust laboratory. Cereal Rust Report Season 2004 Plant Breeding Institute-Cereal Rust Laboratory, University of Sydney. 2004; 2 :1-2 Google Scholar ). Resistance evaluation and key agronomic traits of TaPsIPK1 KO and Fielder plants were calculated by field plot with three replicates per 10 m 2 in 2020 and 30 m 2 in 2021.
To observe Pst development on plants of varying genotypes, we sampled Pst- infected leaves at 24, 48 and 120 hpi. The Pst fungal hyphae were stained by wheatgerm agglutinin conjugated to Alexa-488 (WGA, Amresco, USA) as previously described ( Ayliffe et al., 2011 3. Ayliffe, M. ∙ Devilla, R. ∙ Mago, R. ... Nonhost resistance of rice to rust pathogens Mol. Plant Microbe Interact. 2011; 24 :1143-1155 Crossref Scopus (112) PubMed Google Scholar ). The Pst fungal substomatal vesicle (SV), hyphal length, and hyphal infection areas were observed with an Olympus BX-53 microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).
To assess the cellular response of the wheat mutant and wild type to Pst infection, we performed a DAB (3,3’-diaminobezidine, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) staining assay to detect H 2 O 2 according to previously described methods ( Wang et al., 2007 52. Wang, C.F. ∙ Huang, L.L. ∙ Buchenauer, H. ... Histochemical studies on the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (O 2− and H 2 O 2 ) in the incompatible and compatible interaction of wheat- Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici . Physiol Mol. Plant. 2007; 71 :230-239 Google Scholar ). The sampled Pst -infected leaves were treated with 1.5 mg·mL -1 DAB and incubated under illumination for 5 h at room temperature. Cell necrotic death at the infection site was stained by trypan blue as described ( Peterhansel et al., 1997 48. Peterhansel, C. ∙ Freialdenhoven, A. ∙ Kurth, J. ... Interaction analyses of genes required for resistance responses to powdery mildew in barley reveal distinct pathways leading to leaf cell death Plant Cell. 1997; 9 :1397-1409 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, inoculated leaves were detached from the plants and cut into tip, mid and base segments of approximately equal length. Leaf segments were stained in a 0.5% solution of trypan blue in lactophenol for 2 days at room temperature and mounted in a solution of 2.5 mg/mL chloral hydrate. The cleared and stained segments were observed and photographed by epifluorescence microscopy (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Fifty infection sites were counted from five randomly selected leaf segments for each experiment. Three independent biological repeats were performed.
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were detected by the Plant ROS ELISA Kit (TSZ Biology, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, ROS were extracted from wheat leaves (> 50 mg) by grinding the leaves to a powder and dissolving in 0.01 M PBS. Fifty microliter of the extracting solution was incubated in a 96-well plate for 45 min at 37°C. The wells were washed with 200 μL of wash buffer 5 times in the 96-well plates, and the liquid was removed. Fifty microliter of biotinylated anti-IgG was added, and the plate was incubated for 30 min at 37°C. Then, 50 μL of streptavidin-HRP was added to the plate, and it was again incubated at 37°C for 15 min. Finally, the chromogen solution and the stop solution were added (provided in the Plant ROS ELISA Kit) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The optical density OD 450 was measured with a Multiskan Spectrum plate reader (Tecan, Männerdorf, Switzerland). Each dataset consisted of three repeats.
Genomic DNA was extracted from two-week-old mutant and wild-type (WT) wheat leaves by the CTAB method ( Rogers and Bendich, 1994 50. Rogers, S.O. ∙ Bendich, A.J. Extraction of total cellular DNA from plants, algae and fungi Gelvin, S.B. ∙ Schilperoort, R.A. (Editors) Plant molecular biology manual Springer, 1994; 183-190 Crossref Google Scholar ) for molecular detection. DNA from the pathogen-inoculated leaves was extracted at 14 dpi for fungal biomass analysis. Relative rust fungal DNA biomass was calculated using the cycle threshold (Ct) value of Pst elongation factor DNA against the Ct of wheat genomic elongation factor DNA ( TaEF1α ). All experiments were repeated as three biological replicates. Total RNA was extracted with the MiniBEST Plant RNA Extraction Kit (Takara, Dalian, China) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. First-strand cDNA was synthesized using the RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (ThermoFisher, Waltham, USA). RT-qPCR analysis was performed by ChamQ SYBR qPCR Master Mix (Vazyme, Nanjing, China) on a CFX Connect Real-Time instrument (Bio-Rad, Hercules, USA). The quantitative RT-PCR data were analyzed by the comparative 2 -ΔΔCt method ( Pfaffl, 2001 49. Pfaffl, M.W. A new mathematical model for relative quantification in real-time RT-PCR Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29 :e45 Crossref Scopus (27800) PubMed Google Scholar ). The TaEF1α ( T. aestivum elongation factor 1 alpha, accession number: Q03033) and PsEF1 ( P. striiformis elongation factor 1, accession number: KNE93481) genes were used as internal controls. Each RT-qPCR was conducted as three replicates. Statistical significance was analyzed by Student’s t -test.
For the Y2H assay, the full-length cDNA sequence of TaPsIPK1 was cloned into the pGBKT7 (BD) vector to form BD-TaPsIPK1. The recombinant vector and the prepared candidate Y2H cDNA library plasmids were co-transformed into yeast strain AH109 and incubated on nutrient-deficient medium to screen for potential interacting proteins of TaPsIPK1. cDNA sequences encoding PsSpg1 , PtSpg1 , PgSpg1 and the three homoeologs of TaCBF1 were inserted in frame into the pGADT7 (AD) vector. BD-TaPsIPK1 was co-transformed with AD-PsSpg1, AD-PtSpg1 or AD-PgSpg1 into yeast AH109. Transformants were incubated on SD/-Leu-Trp (SD/-L-T) medium. A single clone was transferred into SD/-L-T liquid medium and cultured at 30°C and 200 rpm for 24 hours, and yeast cells were collected and suspended in sterile water at OD 600 =1.0. The diluted yeast cells were incubated on SD/ Leu -Trp-His-Ade (SD/-L-T-H-A) and X-α-gal-supplemented medium. The interaction between TaPsIPK1 and the three TaCBF1 homoeologs was detected as described above.
The TaPsIPK1 coding sequence was amplified and cloned into the JW771-NLuc vector (NLuc). The coding sequence of PsSpg1 was cloned into the JW772-CLuc vector (Cluc). Split luciferase (LUC) complementation assays were conducted as previously described ( Chen et al., 2008 6. Chen, H. ∙ Zou, Y. ∙ Shang, Y. ... Firefly luciferase complementation imaging assay for protein-protein interactions in plants Plant Physiol. 2008; 146 :368-376 Crossref Scopus (976) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, PsSpg1-Cluc, PtSpg1-Cluc or PgSpg1-Cluc were co-transformed with TaPsIPK1-Nluc and the empty vector in N. benthamiana through A. tumefaciens -mediated infiltration with a final OD 600 =0.6. TaCBF1a-Cluc, TaCBF1b-Cluc or TaCBF1d-Cluc were co-expressed with TaPsIPK1-Nluc as above. The infiltrated plants were placed in the dark for 48 h at 23°C and the infiltrated leaves were sprayed with 1 mM beetle luciferin (Promega, Madison, USA) and kept in the dark for 10 min. The LUC image was captured using a cooled CCD imaging apparatus (Princeton, New Jersey, USA).
Co-immunoprecipitation (coIP) assays were performed after transient expression in N. benthamiana leaves. The coding sequence of TaPsIPK1 was cloned into the expression vector pICH86988 (HA tag), and its interacting genes were cloned into pBinGFP2 (GFP tag). The recombinant plasmids were individually transformed into Agrobacterium strain GV3101. Agrobacterium- transformed cells with GFP-PsSpg1, GFP-PtSpg1, GFP-PgSpg1, or GFP-TaCBF1d were mixed with a strain containing HA-TaPsIPK1 at OD 600 =0.6 and infiltrated into N. benthamiana leaves. After 48 hours at 23°C, the total proteins were extracted using the NP-40 protein lysate (Beyotime, Shanghai, China) containing 1 mM PMSF (Phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride) and incubated with GFP-trap agarose (ChromoTek, Planegg, Germany) at 4°C for 1h. After incubation, the antigen-antibody complex bound to agarose was collected by centrifugation at 2,500 ×g at 4°C for 5 min. The agarose samples were washed 4 times with wash buffer and then boiled in 2×SDS sample buffer (4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.04% bromophenol blue, 120 mM Tris/HCl (pH 6.8), 10% β-mercaptoethanol) for 10 min. Then, the immunoprecipitates were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and detected with anti-HA or anti-GFP antibody.
To assess secretion of PsSpg1, the full-length cDNA sequence of PsSpg1 was cloned into the pFLS2 vector that carries a nuclear localization signal (NLS) and eGFP tag. The PsSpg1 NLS -pFLS2 fusion construct under the control of the RP27 promoter was transformed into the wild-type F. graminearum stain PH-1. Bas1 (for biotrophy associated secreted protein 1 of Magnaporthe oryzae ) ( Khang et al., 2010 27. Khang, C.H. ∙ Berruyer, R. ∙ Giraldo, M.C. ... Translocation of Magnaporthe oryzae effectors into rice cells and their subsequent cell-to-cell movement Plant Cell. 2010; 22 :1388-1403 Crossref Scopus (347) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used as a positive control. The transformed strain was cultured on potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates at 25°C. The conidiation was cultured in liquid carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) medium at 175 rpm for 5 days. Conidium suspensions (10 5 spores·mL -1 ) of the resulting transformants were used for infection assays with 4 days old wheat seedlings of cultivar Xiaoyan 22 ( Jiang et al., 2020 24. Jiang, C. ∙ Hei, R. ∙ Yang, Y. ... An orphan protein of Fusarium graminearum modulates host immunity by mediating proteasomal degradation of TaSnRK1α Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :4382 Crossref Scopus (88) PubMed Google Scholar ). Infectious GFP signals in plant tissues were examined at 2 dpi under laser scanning microscope (LSM 900 with Airyscan2, Zeiss, Jena, Germany).
Total SA was extracted and quantified as previously described with some modifications ( Segarra et al., 2006 51. Segarra, G. ∙ Jáuregui, O. ∙ Casanova, E. ... Simultaneous quantitative LC–ESI-MS/MS analyses of salicylic acid and jasmonic acid in crude extracts of Cucumis sativus under biotic stress Phytochemistry. 2006; 67 :395-401 Crossref Scopus (135) PubMed Google Scholar ). One hundred milligrams of leaf tissue from 2-week-old wheat were used for SA extraction. Frozen samples were ground under liquid N 2 with tissue lyser II (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany), 800 μL methyl alcohol/ddH 2 O/ethanoic acid (90/9/1 v/v) were added and the samples were centrifuged for 1 min at 10, 000 rpm. The supernatant was collected and extracted twice. The combined supernatants were dried under a stream of N 2 , then resuspended in 800 μL 0.05% HOAc in H 2 O-MeCN (85/15 v/v), and analyzed by LC-MS (QTRAP 5500, AB SCIEX, USA). Each sample had 3 biological replicates.
To identify the putative phosphorylation site of TaCBF1d, we performed an in vitro phosphorylation reaction followed by mass spectrometry analysis. Briefly, 6 μg of GST-TaPsIPK1-His and GST-TaCBF1d-HA purified protein were incubated in 25 μL of kinase buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM DTT, 0.5 mM ATP) at 25°C for 1 hour. The proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. Specific bands for the GST-TaCBF1d-HA protein were observed upon coomassie brilliant blue (CBB) staining. The protein gels were treated with 100 mM DTT and 60 mM iodoacetamide (IAM) and then digested with trypsin overnight at 37°C. The phosphopeptides were enriched using TiO 2 Phosphopeptide Enrichment Spin Tips (ThermoFisher, Waltham, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The resulting phosphopeptides were analysed by high-sensitivity LC-MS/MS (QExactive HF-X, ThermoFisher, Waltham, USA) to analyze the charge and peak diagram of protein fragmentation. The following chromatographic columns were used: Acclaim PepMap™ 100 75 μm × 2 cm, nanoViper C18, 3 μm, 100 A, and Acclaim PepMap™ RSLC 75 μm × 25 cm, nanoViper C18, 2 μm, 100 A. The phosphorylated peptide separation was performed at 50°C. The following conditions were used: mobile phase A, 0.1% methanoic acid; mobile phase B, 0.1% methanoic acid and 80% ACN; flow rate, 400 nL·min -1 ; and analysis time, 0 min (1% phase B), 6 min (8% phase B), 70min (32% phase B), 71 min (90% phase B), and 72 min (90% phase B), 72 min (1% phase B), 80 min (1% phase B). For the MS1 scan, the orbitrap resolution was 60 kDa, the AGC target was 3 × 10 6 , the minimum and maximum precursor mass was 350 Da and 1800 Da, respectively. For the MS2 scan, the orbitrap resolution was 15 kDa, the AGC target was 5 × 10 4 , the maximum IT was 45 ms, and the HCD collision energy was 28%. Finally, the results were analyzed using Thermo Scientific Proteome Discoverer 2.4 software. The mass shift was 79.96633 Da, the precursor mass tolerance was 10 ppm, the fragment mass tolerance was 0.02 Da, and the search model was set to global search. The site probability was 75%, the target false discovery rate (FDR) (strict) was 0.01, and the target FDR (relaxed) was 0.05.
Recombinant GST-PsSpg1, GST-PgSpg1, GST-TaPsIPK1-His, GST-TaCBF1d-HA and its mutant protein were expressed in E. Coli BL21. For in vitro phosphorylation of TaPsIPK1 by PsSpg1, 4 μg purified GST-TaPsIPK1-His and 0 μg, 2 μg, 4 μg, or 8 μg GST-PsSpg1 protein or GST-PgSpg1 were incubated in kinase buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM DTT, 0.5 mM ATP). For the phosphorylation of TaCBF1d and its mutant by TaPsIPK1, 4 μg GST-TaPsIPK1-His and 4 μg GST-TaCBF1d-HA or mutated proteins were incubated in kinase buffer. For CIAP treatment, 1 U CIAP (calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase, Takara, Dalian, China) was used. To examine the influence of PsSpg1 on TaPsIPK1 kinase activity on TaCBF1d phosphorylation, 4 μg GST-TaPsIPK1-His and 4 μg GST-TaCBF1d-HA were incubated with 0 μg, 2 μg, 4 μg, or 8 μg of the GST-PsSpg1 protein in kinase buffer. GST-PgSpg1 was used as the negative control. The phosphorylated proteins were separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE with 100 μM ZnCl 2 and 50 μM Phos-tag (Wako, Japan), at a constant voltage of 100 V for 1.5 h. Then, the gel was incubated in transfer buffer supplemented with 10 mM EDTA for 20 min three times. After washing in transfer buffer for 10 min, the proteins were transferred onto a PVDF membrane. GST-TaPsIPK1-His and GST-TaCBF1d-HA were detected by immunoblotting with an anti-His or anti-HA antibody, respectively. Coomassie brilliant blue (CBB) was used as a loading control.
In-gel kinase assays were performed as described ( Ding et al., 2015 10. Ding, Y. ∙ Li, H. ∙ Zhang, X. ... OST1 kinase modulates freezing tolerance by enhancing ICE1 stability in Arabidopsis Dev. Cell. 2015; 32 :278-289 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (453) PubMed Google Scholar ) with some modifications. Briefly, total proteins were extracted from Fielder and TaPsIPK1 KO inoculated with or without Pst race CYR31 by using the NP-40 protein lysate (Beyotime, Shanghai, China) containing 1 mM PMSF. Proteins at a concentration of 1 μg·μL -1 were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE gel containing 0.3 mg·mL -1 GST-TaCBF1d-HA as substrate. The gel was washed three times with washing buffer (1 mM DTT, 5 mM NaF, 0.1 mM Na 3 VO 4 , 0.5 mg·mL -1 BSA, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) for 20 min each, and proteins were renatured three times with buffer (2 mM DTT, 5 mM NaF, 0.1 mM Na 3 VO 4 , and 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) for 1 h at room temperature, 12 h at 4°C and 1 h at room temperature. After being incubated with kinase reaction buffer (2 mM EGTA, 10 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mM Na 3 VO 4 , and 25 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5) for 30 min, the gel was incubated with 30 mL kinase reaction buffer supplemented with 70 μCi [γ- 32 P] and 8 μL cold ATP (1 mM) at room temperature for 2 h and then washed with 5% TCA and 1% sodium pyrophosphate five times for 30 min each. Radioactivity was detected by Personal Molecular Imager (Bio-Rad, USA).
The capillary-based immunoassay was performed according to the ProteinSimple user guide. HA-TaPsIPK1, GFP-PsSpg1 and GFP-TaCBF1d were individually expressed, or HA-TaPsIPK1 was co-expressed with GFP-PsSpg1 or GFP-TaCBF1d in N. benthamiana through Agrobacterium infiltration. The infiltrated leaves were lysed by using bicine and CHAPS lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 20 mM bicine pH 7.6, and 0.6% CHAPS supplemented with aqueous inhibitor mix and DMSO inhibitor mix) (CBS403, ProteinSimple, USA). For CIAP treatment, 1 U of CIAP was used to treat 500 ng protein at 37°C for 30 min. The Premix G2 and pI standards (4-7:5-8=1:1) were added to the protein sample according to the instructions. The protein samples were detected based on capillary isoelectric focusing following the manufacturer’s protocol for the NanoPro1000. For the amphoteric electrolysis of intact protein, the separated proteins were immobilized on the capillary walls. Then the capillaries were incubated with a monoclonal GFP antibody (1:50, Abcam), an HA antibody (1:50, Abcam) for 2 h and secondary antibodies (1:50, ProteinSimple) for 2 h, followed by two washes. Then Luminol and Peroxide XDR (1:1, ProteinSimple) was then added to generate chemiluminescent light. Chemiluminescence signals were visualized and analyzed with Compass software according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The Compass analysis extracts signal to noise (S/N) data at given pI values in the plots.
For the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, the EpiQuik™ Plant ChIP Kit was used as per the description in the instructions (Epigentek, Brooklyn, USA). In detail, 2 g of three-week-old seedlings of the wheat variety Su11 inoculated with Pst race CYR31 were collected at 48 hpi and used for total DNA extraction. First, 1% formaldehyde was used for in vitro cross-linking, and 0.125 M glycine solution was added to the sample to quench the reaction. Then, the chromatin was sheared into 200-500 bp fragments by ultrasonic disruption. The anti-TaCBF1 antibody was generated from rabbit injected with the short polypeptide specific for TaCBF1 protein by Genecreate (Wuhan, China), and the specificity of the synthesized antibody was detected by western blotting. Anti-TaCBF1 (2 μg) polyclonal antibody was added to the fragmented chromatin solution and incubated at 4°C overnight for immunoprecipitation. Negative control reactions were performed in parallel using immunoglobin G (IgG). The immunoprecipitated DNA fragments were extracted following the manufacturer’s instructions. Subsequently, an Illumina sequencing library was constructed with the above DNA, followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) with Illumina HiSeq X Ten (Novogene, Beijing, China). Sequencing reads were mapped to IWGSC reference genome v.1.1 by HISAT2 v.2.0.5 ( Pertea et al., 2016 47. Pertea, M. ∙ Kim, D. ∙ Pertea, G.M. ... Transcript-level expression analysis of RNA-seq experiments with HISAT, StringTie and Ballgown Nat. Protoc. 2016; 11 :1650-1667 Crossref Scopus (3948) PubMed Google Scholar ) with default parameters. Only the unique mapped reads were used for peak identification. The peak summits were used to define the location types in the genome and a strict cutoff was used to identify TaCBF1 target genes by labeling the genes with peak summits located in the upstream 2000 bp from the transcription start sites.
The prepared DNA described in the ChIP assay above was then used for qPCR using respective primer pairs ( Table S4 ) in ChamQ SYBR qPCR Master Mix (Vazyme, Nanjing, China) on a CFX Connect Real-Time instrument (Bio-Rad, Hercules, USA). The expression levels were normalized to IgG immunoprecipitated DNA for enrichment detection and three biological repeats were performed.
For in vivo dual luciferase reporter assays, we cloned the promoter of 21 target genes into the pGL3 vector as the reporter. The basic pGL3 vector contains two expression cassettes, including rLUC (renilla luciferase) and fLUC (firefly luciferase). We cloned TaCBF1d T164A , TaCBF1d T164D , TaCBF1d, PsSpg1 and PgSpg1 into the 163-GFP vector as the effectors. The effectors were co-transformed with the reporter into wheat protoplasts as described by Gu et al. (2013) 17. Gu, L. ∙ Han, Z. ∙ Zhang, L. ... Functional analysis of the 5′ regulatory region of the maize GALACTINOL SYNTHASE2 gene Plant Sci. 2013; 213 :38-45 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar . The relative luciferase activity in the protoplasts incubated at 23°C for 16 h was determined using a GloMax Navigator (Promega, Madison, USA) according to the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Kit (Promega, Madison, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. To detect fLUC activity, 100 μL of luciferase assay reagent was added into the transformed protoplast extraction solution. Then, to detect the fLUC activity, 100 μL of Renilla luciferase reagent was added to the above reaction. The fLUC/rLUC ratio was used to determine the reporter gene activity. The experiments were repeated three times.
For RNA-seq sample preparation, Pst race CYR31 were inoculated on the second leaves of two-week-old transgenic TaPsIPK1 KO, PsSpg1 RNAi and TaCBF1d OE seedlings. Pst -infected wheat leaves were collected at 0 hpi and 12 hpi for RNA extraction. RNA-seq was performed by Novogene (Beijing, China). The clean reads were mapped to the reference wheat genome ( http://plants.ensembl.org/Triticum_aestivum/Info/Index ). Gene expression levels were estimated by fragments per kilobase of transcript per million fragments mapped (FPKM). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed using the DESeq2 and p-values were adjusted using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. Genes with a padj-value <0.05 and log 2 |Fold change| > 1 as thresholds were designated as DEGs.
Quantification of H 2 O 2 -containing areas and Pst growth were performed with the cellSens Entry software program (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Statistical analyses of experimental groups including controls were evaluated by two-tailed Student’s t -test ( ∗ P < 0.05, ∗∗ P < 0.01).
