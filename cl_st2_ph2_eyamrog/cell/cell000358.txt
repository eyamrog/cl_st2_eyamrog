Title: Early introductions and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7 in the United States


Abstract: Summary

The emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7, first detected in the United Kingdom, has become a global public health concern because of its increased transmissibility. Over 2,500 COVID-19 cases associated with this variant have been detected in the United States (US) since December 2020, but the extent of establishment is relatively unknown. Using travel, genomic, and diagnostic data, we highlight that the primary ports of entry for B.1.1.7 in the US were in New York, California, and Florida. Furthermore, we found evidence for many independent B.1.1.7 establishments starting in early December 2020, followed by interstate spread by the end of the month. Finally, we project that B.1.1.7 will be the dominant lineage in many states by mid- to late March. Thus, genomic surveillance for B.1.1.7 and other variants urgently needs to be enhanced to better inform the public health response.

Section: Introduction

The rise of SARS-CoV-2 infections to unprecedented levels in the final months of 2020 has led to the evolution of several variants with concerning mutations or traits ( Lauring and Hodcroft, 2021 23. Lauring, A.S. ∙ Hodcroft, E.B. Genetic Variants of SARS-CoV-2-What Do They Mean? JAMA. 2021; Crossref Scopus (440) PubMed Google Scholar ). One such variant, designated B.1.1.7 (also 501Y.V1), was identified in the United Kingdom (UK) during the fall of 2020 and proceeded to predominate circulation in the region by early 2021 ( Davies et al., 2021 5. Davies, N.G. ∙ Abbott, S. ∙ Barnard, R.C. ..., CMMID COVID-19 Working Group, COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) Consortium Estimated transmissibility and impact of SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 in England Science. 2021; 372 :eabg3055 Crossref Scopus (1570) PubMed Google Scholar ). Subsequent analyses suggested that B.1.1.7 quickly rose in frequency because it was ∼43%–90% more transmissible than other circulating lineages ( Davies et al., 2021 5. Davies, N.G. ∙ Abbott, S. ∙ Barnard, R.C. ..., CMMID COVID-19 Working Group, COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) Consortium Estimated transmissibility and impact of SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 in England Science. 2021; 372 :eabg3055 Crossref Scopus (1570) PubMed Google Scholar ), resulting in a 0.4–0.7 increase in the effective reproductive rate in the UK ( Volz et al., 2021 44. Volz, E. ∙ Mishra, S. ∙ Chand, M. ... Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 Lineage B.1.1.7 in England: Insights from linking epidemiological and genetic data medRxiv. 2021; Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Further analysis of contact tracing data suggested that infections with the B.1.1.7 variant resulted in a 30%–50% higher secondary attack rate ( PHE, 2020 32. PHE Investigation of novel SARS-CoV-2 variant, Technical Briefing 3 Public Health England, 2020 Google Scholar ). The B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 variant is defined by 17 amino acid changes, including 8 changes in the spike protein ( Rambaut et al., 2020 37. Rambaut, A. ∙ Loman, N. ∙ Pybus, O. ... Preliminary genomic characterisation of an emergent SARS-CoV-2 lineage in the UK defined by a novel set of spike mutations Virological, 2020 Google Scholar ). Of particular note is the N501Y mutation in the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein, which is predicted to increase binding to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors ( Starr et al., 2020 39. Starr, T.N. ∙ Greaney, A.J. ∙ Hilton, S.K. ...

Faria, N.R. ∙ Mellan, T.A. ∙ Whittaker, C. ... Genomics and epidemiology of a novel SARS-CoV-2 lineage in Manaus, Brazil medRxiv. 2021; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ; Lauring and Hodcroft, 2021 23. Lauring, A.S. ∙ Hodcroft, E.B. Genetic Variants of SARS-CoV-2-What Do They Mean? JAMA. 2021; Crossref Scopus (440) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tegally et al., 2020 41. Tegally, H. ∙ Wilkinson, E. ∙ Giovanetti, M. ... Emergence and rapid spread of a new severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) lineage with multiple spike mutations in South Africa medRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). In addition, B.1.1.7 variants have a deletion in the spike gene (Δ69/70 HV) that may increase cell infectivity ( Kemp et al., 2021 20. Kemp, S.A. ∙ Collier, D.A. ∙ Datir, R.P. ..., CITIID-NIHR BioResource COVID-19 Collaboration, COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) Consortium SARS-CoV-2 evolution during treatment of chronic infection Nature. 2021; 592 :277-282 Crossref Scopus (620) PubMed Google Scholar ) and has provided a serendipitous tracking method for B.1.1.7 by causing a “spike gene target failure” (SGTF) in the commonly used Thermo Fisher TaqPath COVID-19 Combo Kit ( Borges et al., 2021 2. Borges, V. ∙ Sousa, C. ∙ Menezes, L. ... Tracking SARS-CoV-2 VOC 202012/01 (lineage B.1.1.7) dissemination in Portugal: insights from nationwide RT-PCR Spike gene drop out data Euro. Surveill. 2021; 26 :2100131 Google Scholar ; Volz et al., 2021 44. Volz, E. ∙ Mishra, S. ∙ Chand, M. ... Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 Lineage B.1.1.7 in England: Insights from linking epidemiological and genetic data medRxiv. 2021; Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). As of March 6, 2021, B.1.1.7 has been detected in 94 countries ( https://cov-lineages.org/global_report.html ), which raises concerns that B.1.1.7 will follow the trajectory that it took in the UK and in other places around the world.
Current virus genomic surveillance across the United States (US) is uneven, creating uncertainty about the extent of international introductions, domestic spread, and community transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 variant. There have been 2,672 reported COVID-19 cases associated with B.1.1.7 from 48 states (as of March 6, 2021) ( CDC, 2021a 3. CDC US COVID-19 Cases Caused by Variants 2021 https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/transmission/variant-cases.html Google Scholar ), but these numbers are likely substantial underestimates. Approaches to enhance depth in certain populations and geographies may be required to address such uncertainty. Regardless, the existing framework limits the implementation of effective public health actions, such as targeted public health messaging and enhanced mitigation ( Grubaugh et al., 2021 13. Grubaugh, N.D. ∙ Hodcroft, E.B. ∙ Fauver, J.R. ... Public health actions to control new SARS-CoV-2 variants Cell. 2021; 184 :1127-1132 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ), and allows B.1.1.7 to spread unimpeded ( Galloway et al., 2021 10. Galloway, S.E. ∙ Paul, P. ∙ MacCannell, D.R. ... Emergence of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 Lineage - United States, December 29, 2020-January 12, 2021 MMWR Morb. Mortal. Wkly. Rep. 2021; 70 :95-99 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). The continued rise in B.1.1.7 cases may increase the burden on the US healthcare system and enable further evolution of mutations of public health concern ( Wise, 2021 47. Wise, J. Covid-19: The E484K mutation and the risks it poses BMJ. 2021; 372 :n359 Crossref Scopus (126) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Here, to investigate the locations of B.1.1.7 introductions into the US, to identify significant surveillance gaps, and to provide evidence for community transmission and domestic spread, we combined data from UK air travel into US airports, SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequencing, and clinical diagnostics. We identified where B.1.1.7 introductions were most likely to have occurred and where surveillance for B.1.1.7 cases could be immediately supported. Combining our work with other analyses ( Washington et al., 2021 45. Washington, N.L. ∙ Gangavarapu, K. ∙ Zeller, M. ... Genomic epidemiology identifies emergence and rapid transmission of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 in the United States medRxiv. 2021; Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), we found that B.1.1.7 became independently established in parts of the US starting in early December 2020, and community transmission from some of these sources has already led to interstate spread. Finally, our TaqPath SGTF data indicate that the frequency of B.1.1.7 is rapidly rising, and we project that it will become the dominant SARS-CoV-2 lineage in many states by mid- to late March 2021. Thus, enhanced surveillance and control measures are urgently needed to mitigate B.1.1.7 leading to a resurgence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the US.

Section: Results

Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, international travel can seed the local establishment of new SARS-CoV-2 variants. Thus, to obtain a relative estimate of where B.1.1.7 introductions were most likely to occur, we analyzed air passenger travel volumes from December 2020 coming into all US airports from the initial primary source of the variant, the UK ( Figure 1 ; showing top 15 airports). This period, December 2020, is when B.1.1.7 was rapidly expanding in the UK ( Davies et al., 2021 5. Davies, N.G. ∙ Abbott, S. ∙ Barnard, R.C. ..., CMMID COVID-19 Working Group, COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) Consortium Estimated transmissibility and impact of SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 in England Science. 2021; 372 :eabg3055 Crossref Scopus (1570) PubMed Google Scholar ; Volz et al., 2021 44. Volz, E. ∙ Mishra, S. ∙ Chand, M. ... Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 Lineage B.1.1.7 in England: Insights from linking epidemiological and genetic data medRxiv. 2021; Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) and when we expect the first introductions to be occurring within the US. We found that the airports with the largest passenger volumes as a final destination from the UK were New York JFK (7,687), Los Angeles (3,541), Newark Liberty (3,371), Boston Logan (3,216), Washington Dulles (2,680), and Miami (2,604) ( Figure 1 C; full list shown in Data S1 ). We then implemented a probabilistic choice behavior model to estimate where air passengers may travel after reaching their final airport destination ( Huber et al., 2021 16. Huber, C. ∙ Watts, A. ∙ Grills, A. ... Modelling airport catchment areas to anticipate the spread of infectious diseases across land and air travel Spat. Spatio-Temporal Epidemiol. 2021; 36 :100380 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, by estimating the catchment of each airport, we created a county-level risk map for where early international B.1.1.7 introductions may have occurred within the US ( Figures 1 A and 1B). After summing the risks across all counties, we predict the highest importation risks in New York, California, Florida, Texas, New Jersey, and Massachusetts.
We focused our analysis on travelers entering the US from the UK. For completeness, however, we also obtained air passenger volumes from other countries that also reported B.1.1.7 cases in December 2020: Germany, Denmark, and the United Arab Emirates ( https://outbreak.info/situation-reports/ ; Table S1 ). The total number of air passenger travelers from the UK to the US in December was 45,282, which is greater than the number coming from Germany (31,486), Denmark (5,544), and the United Arab Emirates (15,291); and the majority of the travelers arrived at similar airports (New York JFK, Newark Liberty, Chicago O’Hare, Washington Dulles, and Los Angeles). Finally, the frequency of B.1.1.7 was likely higher in the UK compared to other countries during this time, and thus the risk to travelers was greater. Therefore, we did not include other countries of origin in our flight-based importation risk assessment as they would be unlikely to change our findings of where B.1.1.7 importations would occur in the US ( Figure 1 ).
As of March 6, 2021, 2,672 B.1.1.7 cases from 48 states have been identified in the US ( CDC, 2021a 3. CDC US COVID-19 Cases Caused by Variants 2021 https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/transmission/variant-cases.html Google Scholar ). These numbers, however, are likely significantly underreported, as whole-genome sequencing is needed for B.1.1.7 confirmation. To identify where B.1.1.7 cases may be disproportionately underreported during the early phases of B.1.1.7 emergence in the US ( Figure 2 ), we evaluated the intensity of SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance for each state and compared that to our flight-based risk estimates of where early B.1.1.7 outbreaks may have occurred ( Figure 1 ).
We started by evaluating the percentage of sequenced SARS-CoV-2 clinical samples relative to the number of reported COVID-19 cases ( Figures 2 A and S1 ). For this, we downloaded (1) all SARS-CoV-2 genomes available on GISAID ( https://www.gisaid.org ; accessed March 4, 2021) with “USA” listed as a location and (2) the total number of new COVID-19 cases for each state from December 2020 to February 2021 ( https://covidtracking.com ; accessed on March 4, 2021; Data S1 ). For this 3-month period, which was crucial for B.1.1.7 introductions and establishment, we found that an average of only 0.43% of the US COVID-19 cases were sequenced and posted on GISAID. As sample testing, transport, sequencing, analysis, and data submission can take multiple days to weeks, more data from this time period will likely be available in the near future. This delay can be seen for most states, which have a relatively lower percentage of sequenced cases available for February than January ( Figure S1 ). Still, there are 24 states with less than 0.43% of the COVID-19 cases with available SARS-CoV-2 sequences during December 2020 to February 2021, including 9 states that have not submitted any B.1.1.7 sequences ( Figure 2 A and S1 ; Data S1 ).
While a low fraction of sequenced COVID-19 cases will certainly hinder the detection of B.1.1.7 and other variants of concern, these data alone may not indicate where B.1.1.7 may be disproportionately underreported. Therefore, we compared our risk estimates of B.1.1.7 introductions using air passenger volumes from the UK to all SARS-CoV-2 ( Figure 2 B; Data S1 ) and B.1.1.7 ( Figure 2 C; Data S1 ) genomes sequenced per state. Of the states receiving more than 2,000 air passengers from the UK, we found that COVID-19 cases from New Jersey (0.17% of cases sequenced), Illinois (0.29%), Florida (0.32%), and Virginia (0.37%) have been sequenced below the 0.43% national average ( Figure 2 B). In Florida, many of the available SARS-CoV-2 sequences were targeted using TaqPath SGTF results, and thus, they have sequenced 373 B.1.1.7 genomes to date, the most in the country ( Figure 2 C). In places like New Jersey, Illinois, and Virginia, however, if SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance could be increased, it might determine if B.1.1.7 cases are disproportionately underreported as compared to New York and California.
Our travel data indicated that we should have observed many separate and sustained B.1.1.7 introductions within the US from the UK and perhaps other international locations where the variant may be circulating. To investigate if some of these introductions led to community transmission and/or interstate spread within the US, we combined our SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC; 568 sequences), Yale University (116), University of Michigan (45), and New York State Department of Health (41). Our phylogenetic analysis of these sequences suggests that there were many separate introductions into the US that led to secondary transmission and that some sustained introductions within states were likely from domestic spread ( Figure 3 ).
We generated or received permission to use 770 B.1.1.7 genomes collected from December 19, 2020 to February 14, 2021 from the following states: Florida (267), California (133), Illinois (64), New York (49), Michigan (48), Connecticut (47), Texas (45), New Jersey (35), Georgia (33), Pennsylvania (11), North Carolina (10), Louisiana (9), Indiana (4), Massachusetts (4), Minnesota (3), Tennessee (3), Oklahoma (2), Colorado (1), New Hampshire (1), and Virginia (1). From a larger dataset of 101,079 B.1.1.7 genomes available up to February 26, 2021, we generated a smaller set of 8,864 B.1.1.7 genomes from 59 countries (7,589 from international locations and 1,275 from the US; Figure S2 ) using a subsampling method based on COVID-19 incidence (see STAR Methods ). We further reduced this tree to a representative set of 1,908 genomes, which included our data and 1,139 B.1.1.7 genomes available from the UK and other countries to infer a time-scaled maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree. We subsequently conducted discrete phylogeographic analysis of our fixed time-scaled maximum-likelihood tree using a Bayesian approach ( Dellicour et al., 2020 7. Dellicour, S. ∙ Durkin, K. ∙ Hong, S.L. ... A Phylodynamic Workflow to Rapidly Gain Insights into the Dispersal History and Dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 Lineages Mol. Biol. Evol. 2020; 38 :1608-1613 Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar ; Lemey et al., 2009 24. Lemey, P. ∙ Rambaut, A. ∙ Drummond, A.J. ... Bayesian phylogeography finds its roots PLoS Comput. Biol. 2009; 5 :e1000520 Crossref Scopus (1272) PubMed Google Scholar ) to identify descending clades that likely represent distinct introductions into US states ( Figure 3 ). Furthermore, to identify B.1.1.7 introductions that likely led to secondary community transmission, we limited our analysis to descending clades originating in the US with (1) three or more sequences, (2) >70 bootstrap support, and (3) >70% discrete state probability within the US at the most recent common ancestor (MRCA). Based on these criteria and by performing ancestral trait reconstruction using BEAST, we found 23 distinct B.1.1.7 introductions in the US that led to secondary transmission ( Figure 3 B). From these descending clades, we estimate that the median times to the MRCA (tMRCA) and, by proxy, the estimated times in which B.1.1.7 became locally established occurred throughout early December to January ( Figure 3 B; Data S1 ). Specifically, from clades with more than 15 sequences, we estimate B.1.1.7 establishment in Florida by early December (clade size = 243; 90% confidence interval [CI] = 2020-11-25 to 2020-12-11), New York by mid-December (38; 2020-12-16, 2020-12-23), Texas by mid-December (36; 2020-12-16 to 2020-12-26), Michigan by late December (18; 2020-12-24 to 2020-12-30), and New Jersey/Connecticut by early January (34; 2020-12-28 to 2021-01-06; Data S1 ). By comparison, Washington et al. estimated the tMRCA for the Florida clade to be December 3 (95% highest posterior probability: 2020-11-22 to 2020-12-11) ( Washington et al., 2021 45. Washington, N.L. ∙ Gangavarapu, K. ∙ Zeller, M. ... Genomic epidemiology identifies emergence and rapid transmission of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 in the United States medRxiv. 2021; Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), which is within days of our estimate. They also document a sustained B.1.1.7 introduction into California during early December ( Washington et al., 2021 45. Washington, N.L. ∙ Gangavarapu, K. ∙ Zeller, M. ... Genomic epidemiology identifies emergence and rapid transmission of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 in the United States medRxiv. 2021; Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), a clade with 91 genomes that can be visualized in Figure 3 A, which did not get included as an introduction in our analysis as it did not meet our criteria of >70 bootstrap support.
We also discovered several instances of likely B.1.1.7 interstate spread that occurred between December 2020 and January 2021 ( Figures 3 C–3H). For example, we found regional spread within New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut ( Figures 3 C and 3D), which is expected based on their connectedness among travelers ( Figure 1 B), and that New York was a regional “hub” for SARS-CoV-2 spread during the early pandemic ( Gonzalez-Reiche et al., 2020 11. Gonzalez-Reiche, A.S. ∙ Hernandez, M.M. ∙ Sullivan, M.J. ... Introductions and early spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the New York City area Science. 2020; 369 :297-301 Crossref Scopus (223) PubMed Google Scholar ; Maurano et al., 2020 28. Maurano, M.T. ∙ Ramaswami, S. ∙ Zappile, P. ... Sequencing identifies multiple early introductions of SARS-CoV-2 to the New York City region Genome Res. 2020; 30 :1781-1788 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ). We also found evidence for regional spread between Texas and Louisiana ( Figure 3 E) and from Florida to several other states in the Southeast US ( Figure 3 G), which is further supported by independent findings of a “Southeast” B.1.1.7 clade ( Washington et al., 2021 45. Washington, N.L. ∙ Gangavarapu, K. ∙ Zeller, M. ... Genomic epidemiology identifies emergence and rapid transmission of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 in the United States medRxiv. 2021; Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Finally, our data suggest that out-of-region spread has also occurred from the New York/New Jersey/Connecticut region to Michigan ( Figure 3 D; tMRCA 90% CI, 2020-12-24 to 2021-01-07) and from Florida to Illinois ( Figure 3 H; 2020-12-25 to 2021-01-01). Additional examples can be found by exploring our full dataset ( https://nextstrain.org/community/grubaughlab/CT-SARS-CoV-2/paper5 ).
Our estimates of international and domestic introductions, however, can be significantly influenced by sampling biases and gaps, sequencing and processing errors, and the imperfection of estimating transitions between locations among sequences with low genetic diversity. Moreover, based on the low rate of sequencing of COVID-19 cases in the US ( Figure 2 A), the true number of international and domestic introductions are likely significantly higher than what we report. Importantly, though, our results inform us that many sustained B.1.1.7 introductions occurred throughout the country, with some likely occurring weeks before the first COVID-19 cases associated with B.1.1.7 were reported in the US during late December ( Zimmer and Pietsch, 2020 48. Zimmer, C. ∙ Pietsch, B. First U.S. Case of Highly Contagious Coronavirus Variant Is Found in Colorado 2020 The New York Times, December 29, 2020, A7 Google Scholar ).
Our phylogenetic analysis and those by our colleagues ( Washington et al., 2021 45. Washington, N.L. ∙ Gangavarapu, K. ∙ Zeller, M. ... Genomic epidemiology identifies emergence and rapid transmission of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 in the United States medRxiv. 2021; Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) indicate that the B.1.1.7 introductions that led to community transmission in the US began around early December 2020 ( Figure 3 ). To investigate if B.1.1.7 has increased in frequency since these introductions, we used the TaqPath assay SGTF results from COVID-19 clinical samples ( Figure 4 ). As the spike gene Δ69/70 HV deletion in B.1.1.7 genomes causes SGTF results when using the TaqPath assay, tracking the occurrence of SGTF can provide an indirect measure of changes in B.1.1.7 population frequency ( Borges et al., 2021 2. Borges, V. ∙ Sousa, C. ∙ Menezes, L. ... Tracking SARS-CoV-2 VOC 202012/01 (lineage B.1.1.7) dissemination in Portugal: insights from nationwide RT-PCR Spike gene drop out data Euro.

Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 Lineage B.1.1.7 in England: Insights from linking epidemiological and genetic data medRxiv. 2021; Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our SGTF data suggest that B.1.1.7 is increasing in frequency in all four states investigated (Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, and Illinois) and will likely become the majority SARS-CoV-2 lineage between mid- and late March 2021, in line with other estimates ( Washington et al., 2021 45. Washington, N.L. ∙ Gangavarapu, K. ∙ Zeller, M. ... Genomic epidemiology identifies emergence and rapid transmission of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 in the United States medRxiv. 2021; Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We obtained 422,330 TaqPath COVID-19 RT-PCR test results performed by Tempus and Yale New Haven Hospital clinical diagnostic laboratories from December 2020 through February 2021 on nasal swab samples collected from four states: Illinois (183,077 tests), Connecticut (139,403), New Jersey (58,675), and New York (41,175). The weekly SARS-CoV-2 test positivity rate varied across the states and months, but all were high (>8%) in late December to early January ( Figure 4 A; Data S1 ). From our tested samples from Illinois and Connecticut, we saw a notable decrease in the percentage of SARS-CoV-2-positive test results that follow the national trends.
Among the positive test results, the frequency of SGTF results remained low (<2%) until late January when they dramatically rose to 10%–25% across all states by late February ( Figure 4 B). During January 2021, only 47% (54/116) of the SGTF samples presented in Figure 4 B that we sequenced were identified as B.1.1.7, while the majority were SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.375, which also has the spike gene Δ69/70 HV deletion that causes SGTF ( Larsen and Worobey, 2020 22. Larsen, B.B. ∙ Worobey, M.

In February, however, we found that 90% (254/282) of the SGTF samples that we sequenced were B.1.1.7, including 100% (147/147) from February 15 to 23. Thus, the proportion of SARS-CoV-2-positive samples generating a SGTF result are on the rise across several states, and SGTF is becoming a near-direct measure of B.1.1.7.
Next, we wanted to estimate when we should expect B.1.1.7 to become the majority SARS-CoV-2 lineage among the tested populations represented by our data. We fit our SGTF data to a logistic regression model showing an exponential increase in the percentage of SGTF results among the positive test results, representing an exponential growth of B.1.1.7 across all sites ( Figure 4 C). From this analysis, we estimate that SGTF results will reach the 50% threshold during the week of March 7, 2021 in Connecticut, March 21 in New York, and March 28 in Illinois and New Jersey. Furthermore, we estimate that SGTF results, and by proxy B.1.1.7, will reach the 75% threshold of positive cases ∼2 weeks later. Thus, by mid-April, parts of the COVID-19 pandemic in the US will be dominated by the transmission properties of B.1.1.7.

Section: Discussion

Despite travel restrictions and increased testing requirements, we found evidence for a large number of independent B.1.1.7 introductions into the US, many of which have led to secondary community transmission. Incoming air passenger volumes from the UK predict that New York, California, and Florida would be at highest risk for importation, and finding the earliest B.1.1.7 introductions ( Washington et al., 2021 45. Washington, N.L. ∙ Gangavarapu, K. ∙ Zeller, M. ... Genomic epidemiology identifies emergence and rapid transmission of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 in the United States medRxiv. 2021; Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the high numbers of B.1.1.7 sequences from these states agree with that hypothesis. Indeed, our phylogenetic analyses suggest that in addition to separate introduction events, B.1.1.7 became independently established across the country starting in early December 2020, weeks before the first reported case in the US on December 29, 2020 ( Zimmer and Pietsch, 2020 48. Zimmer, C. ∙ Pietsch, B. First U.S. Case of Highly Contagious Coronavirus Variant Is Found in Colorado 2020 The New York Times, December 29, 2020, A7 Google Scholar ). Around the same time, we found several examples of within-region interstate spread of B.1.1.7 in the Northeast, Southeast, and Southern US and some examples of out-of-region spread from the Northeast and Southeast to the Midwest. This period of “silent” spread across the US is reminiscent of the early 2020 COVID-19 pandemic in the US when diagnostic testing was low ( Fauver et al., 2020 9. Fauver, J.R. ∙ Petrone, M.E. ∙ Hodcroft, E.B. ... Coast-to-Coast Spread of SARS-CoV-2 during the Early Epidemic in the United States Cell. 2020; 181 :990-996.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (216) PubMed Google Scholar ). Overall, our data highlight the relative ease with which SARS-CoV-2 variants can spread undetected throughout the US, particularly in areas where genomic surveillance efforts are minimal.
COVID-19 cases associated with the B.1.1.7 variant are likely significantly underreported across the US. This is because, as a whole, only ∼0.43% of the COVID-19 cases in the US were sequenced from December 2020 to February 2021, which included the period with the highest case rates in the country. The sequencing capacity is highly variable across the country, and our travel data help to identify regions that may be disproportionately underreporting cases of B.1.1.7 and where it would be prudent to immediately prioritize variant surveillance. States such as New Jersey, Illinois, and Virginia received moderately high levels of UK travel yet reported a low proportion of sequenced COVID-19 cases from recent months, presenting the likelihood that B.1.1.7 is significantly underdetected in these regions.
It is estimated that 5% of the COVID-19 cases should be sequenced to detect emerging variants when they exist at a prevalence of 0.1% to 1.0% ( Vavrek et al., 2021 42. Vavrek, D. ∙ Speroni, L. ∙ Curnow, K.J. ... Genomic surveillance at scale is required to detect newly emerging strains at an early timepoint medRxiv. 2021; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). With the nationwide decrease in COVID-19 cases since reaching a new peak in early January 2021 and the initiatives to increase the capacity of SARS-CoV-2 sequencing within state public health laboratories ( CDC, 2021b 4. CDC Genomic Surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 2021 https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/variant-surveillance.html Google Scholar ), there should be a considerable increase in the proportion of COVID-19 cases sequenced in the US during coming months. However, we should not expect an immediate jump to that 5% threshold, and we will need to supplement sequencing with other more conventional laboratory approaches. In the UK, the frequency of B.1.1.7 was primarily tracked across locations using SGTF results from the TaqPath COVID-19 PCR assay ( Borges et al., 2021 2. Borges, V. ∙ Sousa, C. ∙ Menezes, L. ... Tracking SARS-CoV-2 VOC 202012/01 (lineage B.1.1.7) dissemination in Portugal: insights from nationwide RT-PCR Spike gene drop out data Euro. Surveill. 2021; 26 :2100131 Google Scholar ; Volz et al., 2021 44. Volz, E. ∙ Mishra, S. ∙ Chand, M. ... Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 Lineage B.1.1.7 in England: Insights from linking epidemiological and genetic data medRxiv. 2021; Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, we also demonstrate how SGTF data can help to provide insights on B.1.1.7 population frequency changes and how these results can help to prioritize samples for sequencing. In fact, Florida also received a high volume of UK travel (ranked #3 in the US) and has a low overall rate of virus sequencing (0.32% of cases sequenced, ranked #29), but targeted sequencing of SGTF samples has helped identify a large number of B.1.1.7 cases in this state (373, ranked #1) ( Washington et al., 2021 45. Washington, N.L. ∙ Gangavarapu, K. ∙ Zeller, M. ... Genomic epidemiology identifies emergence and rapid transmission of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 in the United States medRxiv. 2021; Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). While TaqPath SGTF results are not definitive for B.1.1.7 ( Larsen and Worobey, 2020 22. Larsen, B.B. ∙ Worobey, M. Identification of a novel SARS-CoV-2 Spike 69-70 deletion lineage circulating in the United States 2020 Published online December 31, 2020 https://virological.org/t/identification-of-a-novel-sars-cov-2-spike-69-70-deletion-lineage-circulating-in-the-united-states/577 Google Scholar ; Moreno et al., 2021 31. Moreno, G. ∙ Braun, K. ∙ Larsen, B.B. ... Detection of non-B.1.1.7 spike Δ69/70 sequences (B.1.375) in the United States 2021 Published online January 12, 2021 https://virological.org/t/detection-of-non-b-1-1-7-spike-69-70-sequences-b-1-375-in-the-united-states/587 Google Scholar ), as its frequency climbs, SGTF data become closer to a proxy for B.1.1.7 presence. Thus, the TaqPath clinical diagnostic assay, plus research-use only PCR assays that are more specific for B.1.1.7 detection (and can also detect other current variants of concern) ( Vogels et al., 2021 43. Vogels, C.B.F. ∙ Breban, M. ∙ Alpert, T. ... PCR assay to enhance global surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern medRxiv. 2021; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ), could provide immediate data to guide public health decision-making, especially in areas where B.1.1.7 cases may be disproportionately underestimated.
The SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 variant of concern has become established in many states within the US. Our data and those of our colleagues ( Washington et al., 2021 45. Washington, N.L. ∙ Gangavarapu, K. ∙ Zeller, M. ... Genomic epidemiology identifies emergence and rapid transmission of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 in the United States medRxiv. 2021; Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) indicate that B.1.1.7 is expanding at an exponential rate and that it will be the dominant SARS-CoV-2 lineage in many places across the US by March or April 2021. While surveillance gaps across the US mean that some communities do not have direct evidence for local B.1.1.7 emergence, it should be assumed that community B.1.1.7 transmission is widespread. With several US states announcing loosening restrictions on gatherings (including restaurants), restrictions on travel, and/or mask requirements, and with sufficient COVID-19 vaccine coverage to reach population immunity still many months away (summer/fall 2021), the near-term impact of B.1.1.7 may be significant. We must use this opportunity to reinforce communications and messaging surrounding the importance of mitigation measures to prevent this variant from exacerbating an already crippling pandemic ( Grubaugh et al., 2021 13. Grubaugh, N.D. ∙ Hodcroft, E.B. ∙ Fauver, J.R. ... Public health actions to control new SARS-CoV-2 variants Cell. 2021; 184 :1127-1132 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ). In reality, it is difficult to implement new measures without supporting data, especially if they impact schools or businesses. Thus, increasing surveillance for B.1.1.7 and other variants through sequencing and more conventional methods should be made a high priority ( CDC, 2021b 4. CDC Genomic Surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 2021 https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/variant-surveillance.html Google Scholar ).
Our study has important limitations. First, our importation risk analysis did not account for the likelihood of transmission among the different regions in the US. As COVID-19 cases were at or near their peak across the country, our assumption was that transmission potential was high everywhere, and that the numbers of potentially infected travelers were a more significant factor. In reality, local conditions and behaviors play an important role for B.1.1.7 establishment, and could explain why B.1.1.7 cases are low in some states as opposed to surveillance deficiencies. Second, while we provide substantial evidence for several independent introductions, increased community transmission, and domestic spread, the significant undersampling that we discuss throughout this manuscript highlights that these events are likely underestimated. As we generate more data, we will be able to reveal additional insights into the patterns of B.1.1.7 spread across the US and the level to which B.1.1.7 will achieve dominance in different regions.

The flight travel volume data were provided by OAG Aviation Worldwide Ltd. OAG Traffic Analyzer, Version 2.5.11 2020 ( http://analytics.oag.com/analyzer-client/home ; accessed 2020-02-22). Travel volume numbers are modeled estimates based on ticket sales and reporting from airline carriers. Travel volume represents the aggregate number of passenger journeys, not necessarily unique individuals. A subset of the available data was used only to capture flights whose origin was the UK and whose final destination was an airport in the US for flights that occurred in December 2020.The map presented in Figures 1 A and 1B, which shows the approximate final destinations of the estimated number of people per county who flew into the top 15 airports in the US on flights inbound from the UK in December 2020 and overlaid onto a map of the US, was generated using R, with the maps, choroplethr, and ggplot2 packages ( Becker et al., 2018 1.

GGPLOT2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis 2016 Springer-Verlag, 2016 Crossref Google Scholar ). The UK inbound flight volume data per airport in the US are displayed in Figure 1 C. These data were also used to calculate the total travelers from the UK per state and was used to generate Figures 2 B and 2C.
COVID-19 clinical samples sequenced by the CDC or sponsored by the CDC were generated for other purposes and shared with our teams via GISAID ( gisaid.org ). See elsewhere for some of the sequencing methodology and data processing ( Washington et al., 2021 45. Washington, N.L. ∙ Gangavarapu, K. ∙ Zeller, M. ... Genomic epidemiology identifies emergence and rapid transmission of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 in the United States medRxiv. 2021; Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Routine clinical COVID-19 diagnostic testing was performed in Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) regulated laboratories at Yale University, Yale New Haven Hospital, and Tempus Labs following Emergency Use Authorization protocols submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration for use of the Applied Biosystems TaqPath COVID-19 Combo Kit (catalog number A47814). SGTF results were defined as any SARS-CoV-2 positive sample with N or ORF1AB Ct < 30 and S gene undetermined. The data were aggregated on a week and state level for surveillance purposes.
The Huff model is a probabilistic approach which is traditionally used to determine the probability that a given population will go to a specific service location ( Huff, 1963 17. Huff, D.L. A Probabilistic Analysis of Shopping Center Trade Areas Land Econ. 1963; 39 :81-90 Crossref Google Scholar , 2003 18. Huff, D.L. Parameter estimation in the Huff model ArcUser. 2003; October–December :34-36 Google Scholar ). Recently it has been applied to determine airport catchment areas, i.e., the location someone will go after arriving at a certain airport ( Huber et al., 2021 16. Huber, C. ∙ Watts, A. ∙ Grills, A. ... Modelling airport catchment areas to anticipate the spread of infectious diseases across land and air travel Spat. Spatio-Temporal Epidemiol. 2021; 36 :100380 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ). This approach incorporates the distance from an airport to surrounding counties (or other geographical units such as census tract) and the attractiveness of that airport. The Huff model is represented as ( Huff, 2003 18. Huff, D.L. Parameter estimation in the Huff model ArcUser. 2003; October–December :34-36 Google Scholar ): 𝑃 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑗 = 𝑆 𝛼 𝑗 𝐷 𝛽 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑗 ∑ 𝑛 𝑖 = 1 𝑆 𝛼 𝑗 𝐷 𝛽 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑗 Where P ij represents the probability that individuals that arrive at airport j will go to county i, S j is a measure of attractiveness for airport j, D ij is the distance from county i to airport j, 𝛼 is an airport attractiveness exponent, and 𝛽 is the distance decay exponent. As a proxy for S j we use the number of passengers arriving at airport j from the United Kingdom in December 2020. Based on previous analysis optimizing the Huff model for airport catchment models, we set 𝛼 to 1 and 𝛽 to 2.
Huber and Rinner recommended the use of a distance cut-off so that the catchment area represents a reasonable maximum distance that a person would be willing to travel from an airport ( Huber and Rinner, 2020 15. Huber, C. ∙ Rinner, C. Market Area Delineation for Airports to Predict the Spread of Infectious Disease Geospatial Technologies for Local and Regional Development Springer International Publishing, 2020; 263-289 Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar ). We selected a distance cut-off of 200km, because this represents a conservative estimate of which counties surrounding each airport are most likely for people to travel to once they deplane ( Huber et al., 2021 16. Huber, C. ∙ Watts, A. ∙ Grills, A. ... Modelling airport catchment areas to anticipate the spread of infectious diseases across land and air travel Spat. Spatio-Temporal Epidemiol. 2021; 36 :100380 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ). Using flight data from OAG, we selected airports in the US that received at least one percent of the total passengers from the UK in December 2020. We utilized a Huff model for each of these airports, and combined these results to estimate the approximate number of people in the counties surrounding the airports that traveled from the UK. These results are displayed in Figures 1 A and 1B.
To perform phylogenetic analyses, we initially built a dataset containing only B.1.1.7 genomes (genomes, n = 101,079) based on data available up to February 26, 2021 on GISAID ( gisaid.org ). Since the proportion of B.1.1.7 cases is not known for most countries, we subsampled this set of genomes according to the proportion of overall COVID-19 cases reported per epidemiological week in each country, using data from the Johns Hopkins University, Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) ( http://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19 ). The subsampling was performed using the pipeline ‘subsampler’ ( http://github.com/andersonbrito/subsampler ), which selected available genomes simulating a scenario of 0.1% of sequenced cases per epiweek, per country. This allowed us to obtain a dataset with 8,864 B.1.1.7 genomes from 59 countries (7,589 international, and 1,275 from the US, all with coverage above 70%), representative of the COVID-19 burden revealed by the epidemiological time series data from each country. As part of this dataset, there were 770 genomes that we sequenced from 20 US states from 2020-12-19 to 2021-02-14, provided by the CDC (568), New York State Department of Health (41), University of Michigan (45), and Yale University (116). The B.1.1.7 samples sequenced by the CDC were generated for public health surveillance, and we received direct permission to download the sequences from GISAID for primary analysis. The final dataset was composed by 8,864 B.1.1.7 genomes, and one P.1 genome to root the tree, serving as an outgroup (Brazil/AM-20842882CA/2020). The complete list of genomes, with author acknowledgments, can be found in Data S2 .
Using an augur pipeline ( Hadfield et al., 2018 14. Hadfield, J. ∙ Megill, C. ∙ Bell, S.M. ... Nextstrain: real-time tracking of pathogen evolution Bioinformatics. 2018; 34 :4121-4123 Crossref Scopus (1781) PubMed Google Scholar ), we performed multiple sequence alignment (MSA) using MAFFT ( Katoh and Standley, 2013 19. Katoh, K. ∙ Standley, D.M. MAFFT multiple sequence alignment software version 7: improvements in performance and usability Mol. Biol. Evol. 2013; 30 :772-780 Crossref Scopus (27222) PubMed Google Scholar ), and the 5′ and 3′ ends of the MSA were masked alongside other problematic sites ( De Maio et al., 2020 6. De Maio, D. ∙ Walker, C. ∙ Borges, R. ... Masking strategies for SARS-CoV-2 alignments 2020 Published online April 30, 2021 https://virological.org/t/masking-strategies-for-sars-cov-2-alignments/480 Google Scholar ) using a script provided with the pipeline. A quick maximum likelihood analysis was performed using IQ-Tree ( Minh et al., 2020 30. Minh, B.Q. ∙ Schmidt, H.A. ∙ Chernomor, O. ... IQ-TREE 2: New Models and Efficient Methods for Phylogenetic Inference in the Genomic Era Mol. Biol. Evol. 2020; 37 :1530-1534 Crossref Scopus (4768) PubMed Google Scholar ) under a GTR nucleotide substitution model. Inference of divergence times and reconstruction of ancestral states were performed using TreeTime 0.8.0 ( Sagulenko et al., 2018 38. Sagulenko, P. ∙ Puller, V. ∙ Neher, R.A. TreeTime: Maximum-likelihood phylodynamic analysis Virus Evol. 2018; 4 :vex042 Crossref Scopus (537) PubMed Google Scholar ). This preliminary analysis aimed at determining the placement of the US B.1.1.7 genomes with respect to international samples ( Figure S2 ), and at removing major molecular clock outliers (n = 34) deviating more than 4 interquartile ranges from the root-to-tip regression line. This phylogeny was then used for identifying large clades containing only genomes of European or Global origin, which were then individually pruned down to contain only three representatives per clade. This procedure dramatically decreased the total number of genomes in the dataset from 8,864 to 1,913, while still keeping the same overall topology. The smaller dataset (1,913 B.1.1.7 genomes) was then run through the same pipeline as described above, but with 1,000 UFBoot replicates during tree inference using IQ-Tree ( Minh et al., 2013 29. Minh, B.Q. ∙ Nguyen, M.A.T. ∙ von Haeseler, A. Ultrafast approximation for phylogenetic bootstrap Mol. Biol. Evol. 2013; 30 :1188-1195 Crossref Scopus (2735) PubMed Google Scholar ). This tree served as input for a root-to-tip analysis using TempEst ( Rambaut et al., 2016 35. Rambaut, A. ∙ Lam, T.T. ∙ Max Carvalho, L. ... Exploring the temporal structure of heterochronous sequences using TempEst (formerly Path-O-Gen) Virus Evol. 2016; 2 :vew007 Crossref Scopus (1222) PubMed Google Scholar ), where 5 outliers with residual above ± 0.0002 subs/site were removed ( Figure S3 ). With a clean set of 1,908 genomes, we proceeded with the inference of the final time-scaled tree using TreeTime ( Sagulenko et al., 2018 38. Sagulenko, P. ∙ Puller, V. ∙ Neher, R.A. TreeTime: Maximum-likelihood phylodynamic analysis Virus Evol. 2018; 4 :vex042 Crossref Scopus (537) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Finally, using the time-scaled maximum-likelihood tree as a fixed topology, we performed Bayesian inference of ancestral states (discrete phylogeographic reconstruction) using BEAST v.1.10 ( Suchard et al., 2018 40. Suchard, M.A. ∙ Lemey, P. ∙ Baele, G. ... Bayesian phylogenetic and phylodynamic data integration using BEAST 1.10 Virus Evol. 2018; 4 :vey016 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), for 15x10 6 generations, sampling every 1,000 generations, which led to MCMC convergence and good mixing, with all parameters showing ESS > 200 when assessed using Tracer 1.7 ( Rambaut et al., 2018 36. Rambaut, A. ∙ Drummond, A.J. ∙ Xie, D. ... Posterior Summarization in Bayesian Phylogenetics Using Tracer 1.7 Syst. Biol. 2018; 67 :901-904 Crossref Scopus (6165) PubMed Google Scholar ). After discarding 10% of the sampled trees as burn-in, we used TreeAnnotator to obtain the final tree, identical to the TreeTime output, but with ancestral states inferred by BEAST. We visualized this time-scaled maximum-likelihood phylogeny using auspice ( Hadfield et al., 2018 14. Hadfield, J. ∙ Megill, C. ∙ Bell, S.M. ... Nextstrain: real-time tracking of pathogen evolution Bioinformatics. 2018; 34 :4121-4123 Crossref Scopus (1781) PubMed Google Scholar ), which can be found on our custom nextstrain page: http://nextstrain.org/community/grubaughlab/CT-SARS-CoV-2/paper5 . We combined bootstrap support and Bayesian inference of ancestral states with our time-scaled maximum-likelihood tree shown in Figure 3 using baltic ( https://github.com/evogytis/baltic ). To identify independent, international introductions of B.1.1.7 in the US, we selected well supported clades (UFBoot > 70; MRCA discrete state probability > 0.7) with 3 or more taxa and represented these clades in Figure 3 B using the “exploded tree view” from baltic ( http://phylo-baltic.github.io/baltic-gallery/basic-exploded-tree-flu/ ), to highlight changes in ancestral state (International origin > USA). The clades shown in Figures 3 C–3G are zoom highlights from the large tree shown in Figure 3 A.
To externally validate the timescale and tMRCA estimates from TreeTime, we utilized the dataset used in the inference of the Bayesian MCC tree generated by Washington et al. ( https://github.com/andersen-lab/paper_2021_early-b117-usa ) to reconstruct a similar time-resolved phylogeny using TreeTime for comparison. We analyzed 4 separate US clades using both methods and found that they produced similar mean tMRCAs and overlapping temporal distributions ( Figure S4 ).
Finally, in order to compare the discrete ancestral state reconstructions fully inferred using TreeTime 0.8.0 with inferences done using BEAST v.1.10, we plotted the results from TimeTree using the same approach used to generate Figure 3 , to create Figure S5 , to highlight that results obtained through maximum-likelihood analysis (using TreeTime) is equivalent to those obtained in more computing intensive Bayesian analysis (using BEAST). The results presented in Figure 3 use BEAST for the discrete ancestral state reconstructions.
A logistic growth model was fit to the weekly SGTF quantification for each state using the glm() function from the stats package in R. Code is available on https://github.com/grubaughlab/paper_2021_B117-US .
