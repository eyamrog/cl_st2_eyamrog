Title: Melanopsin retinal ganglion cells mediate light-promoted brain development


Abstract: Summary

During development, melanopsin-expressing intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) become light sensitive much earlier than rods and cones. IpRGCs project to many subcortical areas, whereas physiological functions of these projections are yet to be fully elucidated. Here, we found that ipRGC-mediated light sensation promotes synaptogenesis of pyramidal neurons in various cortices and the hippocampus. This phenomenon depends on activation of ipRGCs and is mediated by the release of oxytocin from the supraoptic nucleus (SON) and the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) into cerebral-spinal fluid. We further characterized a direct connection between ipRGCs and oxytocin neurons in the SON and mutual projections between oxytocin neurons in the SON and PVN. Moreover, we showed that the lack of ipRGC-mediated, light-promoted early cortical synaptogenesis compromised learning ability in adult mice. Our results highlight the importance of light sensation early in life on the development of learning ability and therefore call attention to suitable light environment for infant care.

Section: Introduction

Light sensation is carried by three types of photoreceptors in the mammalian retina: rods, cones, and intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) ( Do and Yau, 2010 11. Do, M.T.H. ∙ Yau, K.-W. Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells Physiol. Rev. 2010; 90 :1547-1581 Crossref Scopus (319) PubMed Google Scholar ). Rods and cones mediated light sensation forms the image visual perception, and the non-image visual (NIV) function is mainly carried by the light sensation through ipRGCs and the direct projection from ipRGCs to the subcortical areas: suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) for light entrainment of circadian clocks ( Gooley et al., 2003 17. Gooley, J.J. ∙ Lu, J. ∙ Fischer, D. ... A broad role for melanopsin in nonvisual photoreception J. Neurosci. 2003; 23 :7093-7106 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), olivary pretectal nucleus (OPN) for pupillary light reflex (PLR) ( Zhu et al., 2007 57. Zhu, Y. ∙ Tu, D.C. ∙ Denner, D. ... Melanopsin-dependent persistence and photopotentiation of murine pupillary light responses Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2007; 48 :1268-1275 Crossref Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ), and perihabenular nucleus (pHb) for mood regulation ( An et al., 2020 1. An, K. ∙ Zhao, H. ∙ Miao, Y. ... A circadian rhythm-gated subcortical pathway for nighttime-light-induced depressive-like behaviors in mice Nat. Neurosci. 2020; 23 :869-880 Crossref Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although several other subcortical nucleuses, like supraoptic nucleus (SON) and intergeniculate leaflet (IGL), receive direct projections from ipRGCs ( Hattar et al., 2006 22. Hattar, S. ∙ Kumar, M. ∙ Park, A. ... Central projections of melanopsin-expressing retinal ganglion cells in the mouse J. Comp. Neurol. 2006; 497 :326-349 Crossref Scopus (756) PubMed Google Scholar ), their functions are still largely unknown.
Developmentally, ipRGCs respond to light much earlier than rods and cones and mediate the earliest light sensation in mammals ( Sekaran et al., 2005 44. Sekaran, S. ∙ Lupi, D. ∙ Jones, S.L. ...

Physiologic diversity and development of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells Neuron. 2005; 48 :987-999 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (198) PubMed Google Scholar ). In rodents, ipRGCs function as the only retinal photoreceptor until postnatal day 10 (P10), and the neonatal cell density of ipRGCs is 5 times higher than in the adult retina ( Olney, 1968 38.

The circadian pacemaker SCN can be activated upon light sensation in newborn mice, clearly suggesting that ipRGCs do feed light information into newborn brains ( Weaver and Reppert, 1995 51. Weaver, D.R. ∙ Reppert, S.M. Definition of the developmental transition from dopaminergic to photic regulation of c-fos gene expression in the rat suprachiasmatic nucleus Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1995; 33 :136-148 Crossref Scopus (88) PubMed Google Scholar ). Previous studies have shown that early light sensation by ipRGCs contributes to photoaversion in pups ( Johnson et al., 2010 24. Johnson, J. ∙ Wu, V. ∙ Donovan, M. ...

A direct and melanopsin-dependent fetal light response regulates mouse eye development Nature. 2013; 494 :243-246 Crossref Scopus (159) PubMed Google Scholar ), and image visual function ( Chew et al., 2017 9. Chew, K.S. ∙ Renna, J.M. ∙ McNeill, D.S. ...

Here, we discovered that the early light sensation through ipRGCs is required for light-driven cortical synaptogenesis, and we characterized a circuit comprising ipRGCs-oxytocin neurons responsible for this previously unknown NIV function. Furthermore, we demonstrated that early light sensation through ipRGCs is important for learning in the adulthood. Our study thus expands the scope and brain regions known to contribute to NIV functions and demonstrates life-long functional impacts of light sensation during early brain development.

Section: Results

In neonatal mice, cortical synaptogenesis is known to be coincident with ipRGC-mediated light sensation and to occur independently of rods and cones because they are not light responsive before P10 ( Olney, 1968 38. Olney, J.W. An electron microscopic study of synapse formation, receptor outer segment development, and other aspects of developing mouse retina Invest. Ophthalmol. 1968; 7 :250-268 PubMed Google Scholar ). We examined if sensory input through ipRGCs has any impact on cortical synaptogenesis. Melanopsin, the photosensitive protein on the membrane of ipRGCs, is encoded by the Opn4 gene ( Gooley et al., 2001 16. Gooley, J.J. ∙ Lu, J. ∙ Chou, T.C. ... Melanopsin in cells of origin of the retinohypothalamic tract Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4 :1165 Crossref Scopus (475) PubMed Google Scholar ; Provencio et al., 1998 39. Provencio, I. ∙ Jiang, G. ∙ De Grip, W.J. ... Melanopsin: an opsin in melanophores, brain, and eye Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1998; 95 :340-345 Crossref Scopus (808) PubMed Google Scholar ). We recorded pyramidal cells in layer 2/3 of multiple cortices from Opn4 − / − mice and their Opn4 +/+ littermates at postnatal day 9 (P9) ( Figure 1 A). We observed that the frequencies but not amplitudes or kinetics of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) were significantly reduced in Opn4 −/− mice compared with their wild-type littermates in the visual (V1) and somatosensory (S1) cortices ( Figures 1 B, 1C, and S1 A–S1C). Similar phenomenon was present in the auditory (Au1), medial prefrontal cortices (mPFCs), and hippocampus (CA1) ( Figure 1 D). Consistently, we observed a reduction in the spine densities of pyramidal cells from multiple brain areas of the Opn4 −/− mice ( Figures 1 E, 1F, and S1 D) and a reduction in the number of co-localized synaptophysin1 (presynaptic protein) and PSD95 (postsynaptic protein) in V1 and S1 of Opn4 −/− mice ( Figures S1 E and S1F), whereas the number of dendritic segments showed no difference ( Figures S1 G and S1H).
Furthermore, we showed that these reductions in mEPSCs frequencies result from differences in light sensation rather genotype per se, since the mEPSC frequencies of cortical neurons in Opn4 +/+ mice were reduced to a similar level as Opn4 −/− mice when the animals were reared in complete darkness from birth to P9 ( Figures 1 G–1I). Rescue of the melanopsin expression in ipRGCs by injecting Cre recombinase dependent AAV2/2-hSyn-double-floxed inverted open reading frame (DIO)-mOPN4-EGFP into the eye of Opn4 −/− ;Opn4-Cre mice at P0 successfully increased the mEPSC frequencies of cortical pyramidal cells measured at P9 ( Figures 1 J–1L). The success of the rescue was confirmed by the detection of EGFP signals in the retina and the ipRGC-like light responses recorded from EGFP-positive cells ( Figures S1 I and S1J). These results implied a reduction in the number of synapses for pyramidal cells in Opn4 −/− mice due to the lack of early light sensation. Thus, ipRGC-mediated light sensation during early development functionally contributes to cortical synaptogenesis, revealing a previously unknown function of ipRGCs.
Given our finding suggests that Opn4 −/− mice have a reduced number of synapses in multiple cortices, we reasoned that disturbance of some diffusive signal may underlie the widespread reduction of cortical synaptogenesis in Opn4 −/− mice. Oxytocin is a neuropeptide signaling molecule that is required for the experience-dependent development of multiple cortices and is known to exert its effects on synapses in a diffusive manner ( Vaidyanathan and Hammock, 2017 49. Vaidyanathan, R. ∙ Hammock, E.A.D. Oxytocin receptor dynamics in the brain across development and species Dev. Neurobiol. 2017; 77 :143-157 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zheng et al., 2014 56. Zheng, J.-J. ∙ Li, S.-J. ∙ Zhang, X.-D. ... Oxytocin mediates early experience-dependent cross-modal plasticity in the sensory cortices Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17 :391-399 Crossref Scopus (160) PubMed Google Scholar ). Previous work has demonstrated that activation of oxytocin neurons promotes the somato-dendritic release of the oxytocin neuropeptide into circulating cerebral-spinal fluid (CSF) ( Coombes et al., 1991 10. Coombes, J.E. ∙ Robinson, I.C. ∙ Antoni, F.A. ... Release of oxytocin Into blood and Into cerebrospinal fluid induced by naloxone in anaesthetized morphine-dependent rats: the role of the paraventricular nucleus J.

Physiol. 2016; 7 :235-252 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ). We therefore examined the oxytocin level in the CSF using liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and found that the CSF oxytocin level in Opn4 −/− mice at P9 was indeed significantly reduced compared with Opn4 +/+ mice ( Figures 2 A–2D).
Having demonstrated that Opn4 −/− mice have reduced CSF oxytocin levels, we further investigated the anatomical connection(s) from ipRGCs to hypothalamic oxytocin-releasing neurons. It is known that in mammalian brains oxytocin neurons are mainly located in the SON and the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) ( Landgraf and Neumann, 2004 27. Landgraf, R. ∙ Neumann, I.D.

Hypothalamic integration: organization of the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1983; 6 :269-324 Crossref Scopus (1756) PubMed Google Scholar ). We injected AAV2/2-hEF1a-DIO-membrane-tdTomato (mtdT) into one eye of Opn4-Cre mice at P0. The expression of mtdT on the membrane of ipRGCs allowed tracing of their terminals in the hypothalamus ( Figure 2 E). We found axon terminal with mtdT signals in SON at P9, stronger in the contralateral SON than in the ipsilateral one, and no signal was detected in PVN ( Figure 2 F). This result shows that ipRGCs project directly to the SON but not the PVN. We then transfected RGCs at P5 with herpes simplex virus (HSV) ( Kuypers and Ugolini, 1990 26. Kuypers, H.G.J.M. ∙ Ugolini, G. Viruses as transneuronal tracers Trends Neurosci. 1990; 13 :71-75 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (219) PubMed Google Scholar ), an anterograde polysynaptic tracer coding GFP, in Oxt-IRES-Cre;Ai9 mice whose oxytocin neurons are labeled with fluorescence protein tdTomato (tdT). We detected HSV-GFP positive cells co-localized with tdT in both the SON and PVN, indicating that SON/PVN oxytocin neurons are synaptically connected to retina at P9 ( Figures 2 G and 2H). Counting the tdT and HSV co-labeled cells revealed that on average, 29% and 33% of the oxytocin neurons in the PVN and SON are connected to RGCs, respectively ( Figure 2 I). On the other hand, 12% and 20% of HSV positive cells in PVN and SON are oxytocin neurons ( Figure S2 A).
To further analyze the circuit between ipRGCs and oxytocin neurons in pups, transsynaptic viral tools were applied; however, due to the limited time between P0 and P10 for several viruses to work in a sequence, the labeling efficiency was very low. We therefore dissected this circuit between ipRGCs and oxytocin neurons in adult mice. We first injected AAV2/5-hEF1a-DIO-H2B-EGFP-TVA and AAV2/5-hEF1a-DIO-RVG into the SON of Oxt-IRES-Cre animals; 3 weeks later, RV-Enva-▵G-dsRed was injected into the same SON ( Figure 2 J). Aided by both TVA and RVG, RV is able to retrogradely transfect neurons that form synapses with SON oxytocin neurons. We detected RV-dsRed signals in retinal ganglion cells, and melanopsin immunostaining showed that around 32% of the RV-positive cells are ipRGCs ( Figure 2 K); note that this may be an underestimation because melanopsin immunostaining cannot label all ipRGCs ( Hattar et al., 2002 23. Hattar, S. ∙ Liao, H.W. ∙ Takao, M. ...

Neurol. 2019; 527 :297-311 Crossref Scopus (95) PubMed Google Scholar ). These results establish the direct connections between ipRGCs and oxytocin neurons in the SON.
Recalling that RGCs apparently project indirectly to the PVN, it was consistent that our retrograde trans-monosynaptic labeling from the PVN revealed no RV-dsRed positive cells in the retina of Oxt-IRES-Cre mice ( Figures S2 B and S2C). However, RV-dsRed signals were evident in the SON upon retrograde labeling from the PVN oxytocin neurons ( Figure S2 C), supporting synaptic connections from the SON neurons to oxytocin neurons in the PVN. Furthermore, intraocular injection of HSV-GFP into the same animals ( Figure S2 B) revealed that SON neurons co-expressed RV-dsRed and HSV-GFP, confirming the existence of a retinal-hypothalamic circuit linking RGCs in the retina to the SON and on to PVN oxytocin neurons. A previous study reported that PVN oxytocin neurons project to SON oxytocin neurons ( Eliava et al., 2016 12. Eliava, M. ∙ Melchior, M. ∙ Knobloch-Bollmann, H.S. ... A new population of parvocellular oxytocin neurons controlling magnocellular neuron activity and inflammatory pain processing Neuron. 2016; 89 :1291-1304 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (296) PubMed Google Scholar ), and we successfully confirmed this with retrograde trans-monosynaptic labeling from the SON oxytocin neurons of Oxt-IRES-Cre mice followed by immunostaining of oxytocin in the PVN ( Figures S2 D and S2E). Although the transsynaptic labeling in pups has very low efficiency due to the limited time for viral expression, the mutual projection between SON and PVN was still confirmed in pups ( Figures S2 F–S2I).
Having characterized the retina-SON-PVN circuit, we next asked if SON oxytocin neurons may also project to PVN oxytocin neurons. Pursuing this, we injected AAV2/9-hEF1α-DIO-EYFP and AAV2/5-hEF1a-DIO-RVG into the SON following retrograde trans-monosynaptic tracing with RV-dsRed from the PVN oxytocin neurons of Oxt-IRES-Cre mice ( Figure 2 L). Our detection of labeling overlap between RV-dsRed and EYFP in SON neurons showed that SON oxytocin neurons do project to PVN oxytocin neurons ( Figure 2 M). Thus, we demonstrated there are mutual projections between oxytocin neurons in the SON and PVN. Given that AAV2/5-hEF1a-DIO-RVG injected in the SON can help RV expressed in the SON oxytocin neurons to further cross one synapse retrogradely, we were able to test whether ipRGCs are connected with the mutual connection of oxytocin neurons. RV-dsRed positive retinal ganglion cells were found in the retina among which at least 54% are ipRGCs ( Figure 2 M).
Taken together, our tracing results revealed that ipRGCs make monosynaptic contacts with SON oxytocin neurons, which themselves further project to PVN oxytocin neurons. Moreover, our demonstration that PVN oxytocin neurons project to SON oxytocin neurons supports the possibility of light input triggered synchronization between the oxytocin neurons of these two nuclei ( Figure 2 N).
After characterizing the circuit connections between ipRGCs and oxytocin neurons, we next examined whether light can activate oxytocin neurons through ipRGCs during development. We dark-adapted Opn4;Oxt-IRES-Cre;Ai9 pups at P9 for 2 h and then exposed them to light for 10 min ( Figure 3 A). Exposure to light resulted in obviously stronger cFos expression in both the SON and PVN of Opn4 +/+ ;Oxt-IRES-Cre;Ai9 mice compared with other three groups ( Figure 3 B). Consistently, the number of cFos-expressing oxytocin neurons was significantly higher in the Opn4 +/+ ;Oxt-IRES-Cre;Ai9 light-exposed group than Opn4 +/+ ;Oxt-IRES-Cre;Ai9 mice kept in the dark and light-exposed Opn4 −/− ;Oxt-IRES-Cre;Ai9 mice; meanwhile, there was no significant difference between light-exposed and dark-control Opn4 −/− ;Oxt-IRES-Cre;Ai9 mice ( Figure 3 C). Together, these results demonstrate that ipRGC-mediated light sensation activates oxytocin neurons at P9.
After showing light sensation can activate oxytocin-releasing neurons and further affect CSF oxytocin level, we asked whether this light-oxytocin pathway is required for the light-promoted synaptogenesis. We crossbred oxytocin knockout mice with Opn4 +/+ and Opn4 −/− mice to compare synaptogenesis between Opn4 −/− ;Oxt −/− mice and their Opn4 +/+ ;Oxt −/− littermates. Interestingly, and suggesting that oxytocin is necessary for Opn4 -dependent light-promoted synaptogenesis, we detected no differences in mEPSC frequencies in the V1 and S1 cortices for animals with an oxytocin knockout background ( Figure 3 D). Our results thus support that cortical synaptogenesis during early development requires oxytocin given the mEPSC frequencies at P9 are extremely low for oxytocin knockout mice. Sensory inputs including light inputs will all stimulate oxytocin-releasing neurons to exert their influence on synaptogenesis during early development.
To assess whether oxytocin directly impacts synaptogenesis, acute brain slices from P9 Opn4 +/+ / Opn4 −/− animals were incubated in a bath solution containing 1 μM oxytocin for 1 h prior to mEPSC recordings ( Figure 3 E). Oxytocin did not alter mEPSC frequencies in the visual or somatosensory cortices of Opn4 +/+ mice but did increase the mEPSC frequencies of Opn4 −/− mice, which reached the level of wild-type animals ( Figure 3 F). Application of oxytocin in vitro resulted in a slight decrease of mean mEPSC amplitudes in all animals which was attributed to the increased number of mEPSC events with small amplitudes ( Figure S3 A). Consistently, spine densities of pyramidal cells were also increased after oxytocin incubation ( Figures 3 G and 3H). This result shows that the synaptogenesis deficit of the Opn4 −/− mice can be rescued by extracellular supplementation of oxytocin. Furthermore, we assessed whether activation of oxytocin neurons in vivo could rescue the deficits observed in Opn4 − / − mice. We injected chemogenetic tool AAV2/9-hSyn-DIO-hM3D(Gq)-mCherry to SON oxytocin neurons in Opn4 − / − ;Oxt-IRES-Cre mice at PO. Then, we confirmed the successful activation of oxytocin neurons by Clozapine N-oxide (CNO) in brain slices at P5 ( Figures S3 B–S3D). CNO was administered intraperitoneally 3 times a day from P3 to P9 and recordings of mEPSC from pyramidal cells in V1 and S1 at P9 showed frequencies of mEPSCs were significantly increased by activating oxytocin neurons in Opn4 −/− mice compared with the sham group ( Figures 3 I and 3J).
After confirming that murine rods and cones of Opn4 −/− mice start to sense light from P10 by electroretinogram (ERG) recordings ( Figure S4 A), we explored roles of light sensation by rods and cones in the cortical synaptogenesis process. Interestingly, we detected no differences in the mEPSC frequencies of Opn4 −/− mice compared with Opn4 +/+ mice at P13–15 ( Figures 4 A and 4B). This result suggested that light perceived by rods and cones after P9 can apparently compensate for the cortical synaptogenesis deficits of Opn4 −/− mice. Considering the fact that rods and cones connect to ipRGCs ( Güler et al., 2008 20. Güler, A.D. ∙ Ecker, J.L. ∙ Lall, G.S. ... Melanopsin cells are the principal conduits for rod-cone input to non-image-forming vision Nature. 2008; 453 :102-105 Crossref Scopus (676) PubMed Google Scholar ), it is plausible that ipRGCs may also transmit light signal sensed by rods and cones to oxytocin neurons and facilitate synaptogenesis.
To test this hypothesis, we injected saporin conjugated with an anti-melanopsin antibody (melanopsin-SAP) ( Göz et al., 2008 18. Göz, D. ∙ Studholme, K. ∙ Lappi, D.A. ... Targeted destruction of photosensitive retinal ganglion cells with a saporin conjugate alters the effects of light on mouse circadian rhythms PLoS One. 2008; 3 :e3153 Crossref Scopus (128) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhang et al., 2017 54. Zhang, J. ∙ Wang, H. ∙ Wu, S. ... Regulation of Reentrainment Function Is Dependent on a Certain Minimal Number of Intact Functional ipRGCs in rd Mice J. Ophthalmol. 2017; 2017 :6804853 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ) to the retina of C57BL/6J mice at P0 to specifically ablate ipRGCs. After injection, these pups together with their control pups injected with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) were reared in darkness until P11 to ensure the same level of light input prior to maturation of rods and cones. After P11, the pups were released to a 12:12 light-dark (LD) cycle until P15 ( Figure 4 C). The potential off-target effect of SAP injection has been evaluated with RGC specific protein, Brn3a, immunostaining, and no normal RGCs were affected at the concentration of 50 ng/eye ( Figures 4 D and 4E). On average, about 75% of ipRGCs in the retina were ablated in the SAP-injected retina compared with the PBS-injected control retina examined at P15 ( Figure 4 F). Consistent with our tracing studies establishing ipRGCs-SON projections, we also found that very few axonal terminals were evident in the ipRGC-projecting area of the SON in the SAP-injected mice, as evaluated using intraocular injection of cholera toxin subunit B (CTB-647) ( Luppi et al., 1990 32. Luppi, P.H. ∙ Fort, P. ∙ Jouvet, M. Iontophoretic application of unconjugated cholera toxin B subunit (CTb) combined with immunohistochemistry of neurochemical substances: a method for transmitter identification of retrogradely labeled neurons Brain Res. 1990; 534 :209-224 Crossref Scopus (275) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 4 G). Keeping mice in the LD cycle for 5 days after near complete ablation of ipRGCs, we observed reduced cortical mEPSC frequencies in the SAP-injected mice at P13–15, indicating reduced cortical synaptogenesis and suggesting that even after maturation of rods and cones, functional ipRGCs are essential for cortical synaptogenesis ( Figure 4 H). To assess the contribution of ipRGCs in transmitting light signal from rods/cones with intact retinal connections, another approach was taken to silence ipRGCs with chemogenetic tool hM4Di. We injected AAV2/2-hSyn-DIO-hM4D(Gi)-mCherry into the retina of Opn4 −/− ;Opn4-Cre mice at P0 ( Figure 4 I). We verified the successful virus expression at P6 ( Figure 4 J). CNO was administered intraperitoneally 3 times a day from P3 to P14 to suppress activities of ipRGCs. At P14, we recorded mEPSCs from pyramidal cells in V1 and S1 and found similar results as in the SAP ablation experiment that silencing ipRGCs reduced synaptogenesis greatly ( Figure 4 K). Thus, beyond their capacity to sense light themselves, it is clear that ipRGCs also function as a form of conduit transmitting light signals from mature rods and cones onward to oxytocin neurons and facilitate cortical synaptogenesis.
We next examined in the case of no rods and cones light sensation, whether ipRGCs alone are sufficient to drive cortical synaptogenesis throughout development. We used a triple knockout (TKO) mouse line, Gnat1 −/− ; Cnga3 −/− ; Opn4 −/− ( Biel et al., 1999 4. Biel, M. ∙ Seeliger, M. ∙ Pfeifer, A. ...

USA. 1999; 96 :7553-7557 Crossref Scopus (261) PubMed Google Scholar ; Calvert et al., 2000 6. Calvert, P.D. ∙ Krasnoperova, N.V. ∙ Lyubarsky, A.L. ...

USA. 2000; 97 :13913-13918 Crossref Scopus (312) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hattar et al., 2002 23. Hattar, S. ∙ Liao, H.W. ∙ Takao, M. ... Melanopsin-containing retinal ganglion cells: architecture, projections, and intrinsic photosensitivity Science. 2002; 295 :1065-1070 Crossref Scopus (2165) PubMed Google Scholar ), in which rods, cones, and ipRGCs are all light insensitive. We compared these TKO mice with their littermates of the Gnat1 −/− ; Cnga3 −/− ; Opn4 +/+ genotype in which ipRGCs are the only light sensitive retinal photoreceptors (“melanopsin-only” mice: MO) ( Figure 4 L). MO mice have higher mEPSC frequencies in their visual and somatosensory cortices than the TKO mice recorded at P15 ( Figure 4 M), and the higher level of synaptogenesis in MO mice was further supported by their higher spine densities observed at both P15 ( Figure 4 N) and P30 ( Figure S4 B). Thus, ipRGCs alone are sufficient to promote cortical development to a certain extent.
We then tested whether the observed deficits in cortical synaptogenesis at early developmental stages have any long-term impacts on adult mice. We tested the learning ability of 2-month-old animals using a sound discrimination task of the Go/No-go paradigm ( Figure 5 A). For context, discriminability d′ values (calculated from the hit rate and false alarm rate throughout learning, see detailed explanation in STAR Methods ) indicate the ability to discriminate two different tones; higher d′ values indicate superior sound discrimination. By fitting the measured d′ values versus the training trials to a sigmoid function as the learning curve, we obtained the learned threshold (the number of trials required to reach d′ = 1) as the number of trials for discriminating the Go and No-go tones ( Figure 5 B). We found that Opn4 −/− mice took more trials than Opn4 +/+ littermates to reach the threshold for a successfully learned stage, indicating slower learning for Opn4 −/− mice ( Figures 5 C–5E). However, eventually all animals reached similar d′ values with extended learning trials, suggesting the present deficits are rather in learning than in discrimination ability ( Figure S5 F).
Since Opn4 −/− mice do not have melanopsin-dependent light sensation from early development to adulthood, to discriminate whether the observed learning deficit results from the lack of melanopsin during early development or adulthood, we first rescued melanopsin expression at P0 by intraocularly injecting AAV2/2-hSyn-DIO-mOPN4-P2A-EGFP to Opn4 −/− ; Opn4-Cre mice ( Figure 5 F). Successful rescue has been detected at P5 ( Figures S1 I and S1J), and the learning ability tested at 3-month-old age was significantly improved compared with animals that received sham viral injection expressing only GFP ( Figures 5 G and 5H). The steady state d′ did not differ again, suggesting that the difference in the melanopsin expression from early development did not affect the auditory discrimination ability in adulthood ( Figure S5 G).
Then, the same rescue protocol was performed in 2-month-old Opn4 −/− ; Opn4-Cre mice ( Figure 5 I). 4 weeks after viral injection, mOPN4-injected mice showed positive melanopsin immunostaining signals in the retinas ( Figure S5 A) and ipRGC-mediated PLR ( Lucas et al., 2003 30. Lucas, R.J. ∙ Hattar, S. ∙ Takao, M. ... Diminished pupillary light reflex at high irradiances in melanopsin-knockout mice Science. 2003; 299 :245-247 Crossref Scopus (702) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure S5 B). These results indicate that re-expressed melanopsin in ipRGCs are functional. However, we found that complementation of melanopsin expression in adult mice (from 2 months) did not rescue the learning deficit of Opn4 −/− ; Opn4-Cre mice ( Figures 5 J and 5K) and not affect the discrimination ability as well ( Figure S5 H). Furthermore, we found no learning deficits when we successfully knocked out melanopsin in adulthood by injecting AAV2/2-Syn-cre into the retina of adult (2 months old) cre-dependent conditional Opn4 knockout mice ( Opn4 f/f ) ( Wang et al., 2017 50. Wang, Q. ∙ Yue, W.W.S. ∙ Jiang, Z. ... Synergistic signaling by light and acetylcholine in mouse iris sphincter muscle Curr. Biol. 2017; 27 :1791-1800.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figures 5 L–5N and S5 I). Collectively, these experiments show that melanopsin deficiency during early postnatal development but not adulthood causes learning deficits.
To test whether the learning deficit observed in adult Opn4 −/− mice results from the lack of light sensation during early development, we performed the sound discrimination experiment with dark-reared animals: animals of both Opn4 +/+ and Opn4 −/− genotypes were dark reared from birth until P15 and then released to a LD (12:12 h) cycle until they were behaviorally assessed at 2 months old ( Figure 5 O). The original difference in learning ability between Opn4 +/+ and Opn4 −/− mice ( Figure 5 E) was not evident for the dark-reared Opn4 +/+ and Opn4 −/− groups, indicating that the lack of early light sensation reduces learning ability in adulthood ( Figures 5 P and 5Q). The auditory discrimination ability also showed no difference ( Figure S5 J).
Since activation of SON oxytocin neurons during development rescued the synaptogenesis deficits of Opn4 −/− mice ( Figures 3 I and 3J). We then tested if the learning ability deficits were rescued too. SON oxytocin neurons were activated from P3 to P15 following AAV2/9-hSyn-DIO-hM3D(Gq)-mCherry injection at P0 in the SON of Opn4 −/− ; Oxt-IRES-Cre mice. The learning behavior was then evaluated at 2 months ( Figure 5 R). We found that learning ability was rescued ( Figures 5 S and 5T) by activating SON oxytocin neurons during development, but the discrimination ability did not change ( Figure S5 K). We observed that the learning thresholds of Opn4 −/− ; Oxt-IRES-Cre mice are generally higher than other animals tested in this study. This could be due to the lineage difference of Oxt-IRES-Cre line.
Taken together, these behavioral experiments demonstrate that disruption of melanopsin-mediated early light sensation deleteriously impact long-term cognitive functions including learning. Consistent to the observation that activating SON oxytocin neurons during early development rescued synaptogenesis deficits in Opn4 −/− mice, we found the learning deficits in the adulthood was also rescued by activating SON oxytocin neurons from P3–P15.

Section: Discussion

Here, we revealed that early light sensation by ipRGCs contributes to cortical synaptogenesis by activating hypothalamic oxytocin neurons through ipRGCs-SON-PVN connections. Synaptogenesis is one of the hallmarks of brain development, and a major surge in synapse formation occurs rapidly after birth. Cortical layer 2/3 neurons form long range synaptic connections across multiple cortices and function to integrate multi-modal signals. It is known that long-range connectivity among cortical regions is built up at the same time when sensory pathways are becoming activated ( Bavelier and Neville, 2002 3. Bavelier, D. ∙ Neville, H.J. Cross-modal plasticity: where and how? Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3 :443-452 Crossref Scopus (780) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, ipRGCs-oxytocin neurons connections—which we show here link sensory inputs with the secretion of a diffusive neuropeptide in the cortex—may plausibly explain the mechanism underlying the required developmental synchronization of sensory inputs, cortical synaptogenesis, and cross-cortical connectivity.
Several ipRGC-mediated non-image vision functions have been identified, including PLR, photoentrainement of circadian rhythms, and mood regulation ( An et al., 2020 1. An, K. ∙ Zhao, H. ∙ Miao, Y. ... A circadian rhythm-gated subcortical pathway for nighttime-light-induced depressive-like behaviors in mice Nat.

Melanopsin-dependent persistence and photopotentiation of murine pupillary light responses Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2007; 48 :1268-1275 Crossref Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ). These functions are mediated via projections of ipRGCs directly to the functioning brain nuclei, for example, the OPN for PLR and the SCN for synchronization of circadian clocks. The ipRGC functions we discovered here constitute a distinct class of NIV function: activation of ipRGCs stimulates the secretion of neuropeptides into the CSF, thereby establishing a permissive signal for promoting synaptogenesis in diverse brain areas. There are sparse projections from oxytocin neurons to cortex reported in the adult mice brain ( Marlin et al., 2015 33. Marlin, B.J. ∙ Mitre, M. ∙ D’amour, J.A. ... Oxytocin enables maternal behaviour by balancing cortical inhibition Nature. 2015; 520 :499-504 Crossref Scopus (485) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhang et al., 2021 53. Zhang, B. ∙ Qiu, L. ∙ Xiao, W. ... Reconstruction of the hypothalamo-neurohypophysial system and functional dissection of magnocellular oxytocin neurons in the brain Neuron. 2021; 109 :331-346.e7 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (66) PubMed Google Scholar ); however, we did not see such projection in developing brain which prompted us to consider the somatodendritic release of oxytocin neurons constitutes the major source of oxytocin in the CSF, although diffusion of oxytocin into CSF from axonal release cannot be excluded completely.
Other opsins, like OPN3 and OPN5, also start to sense light from early development stage ( Buhr et al., 2019 5. Buhr, E.D. ∙ Vemaraju, S. ∙ Diaz, N. ...

Violet-light suppression of thermogenesis by opsin 5 hypothalamic neurons Nature. 2020; 585 :420-425 Crossref Scopus (75) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, experiments from OPN4 knockout mice and rescue with OPN4 gene have convincingly demonstrated that OPN4 is the major opsin mediating this light-promoted synaptogenesis. In addition, the specific rescue of melanopsin expression in ipRGCs experiments confirmed that OPN4 in ipRGCs other than expressed elsewhere ( Kusumoto et al., 2020 25. Kusumoto, J. ∙ Takeo, M. ∙ Hashikawa, K. ... OPN4 belongs to the photosensitive system of the human skin Genes Cells. 2020; 25 :215-225 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ; Nissilä et al., 2017 35. Nissilä, J.S. ∙ Mänttäri, S.K. ∙ Särkioja, T.T. ... The distribution of melanopsin (OPN4) protein in the human brain Chronobiol. Int. 2017; 34 :37-44 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ) is sufficient to drive the light-promoted cortical development.
We confirmed the direct projection of ipRGCs to SON and showed retinal ganglion cells connect with oxytocin neurons in both SON and PVN in pups. This projection leads to the activation of oxytocin neurons in both SON and PVN upon light sensation mediated by ipRGCs. The detailed ipRGCs-oxytocin neurons circuit connections were then studied by retrograde transsynaptic tracing technique in adult mouse brains. The reason that this could not be done in pups is that transsynaptic tracing tools require multiple viruses to express in a sequence which takes more time than the time window of interests in this work.
Distribution of oxytocin receptor in the developing brain has been shown to spread widely in cortex and hippocampal CA2 and CA3 regions ( Hammock and Levitt, 2013 21. Hammock, E.A.D. ∙ Levitt, P. Oxytocin receptor ligand binding in embryonic tissue and postnatal brain development of the C57BL/6J mouse Front. Behav. Neurosci. 2013; 7 :195 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), whereas in the adult brain, oxytocin receptors are more concentrated in specific brain regions ( Mitre et al., 2016 34. Mitre, M. ∙ Marlin, B.J. ∙ Schiavo, J.K. ... A distributed network for social cognition enriched for oxytocin receptors J. Neurosci. 2016; 36 :2517-2535 Crossref Scopus (193) PubMed Google Scholar ). During development, oxytocin receptor concentration peaks around postnatal week 2 and cortical layer II/III region has the highest signal in the receptor ligand binding essay. These evidences are coherent with the wide spread synaptogenesis phenotype reported in the current work.
Moreover, we demonstrate that the light-promoted early cortical development has prolonged impacts on learning ability in adulthood. These processes may exist generally in mammals including humans. Given our discovery of functional impacts of early light sensation and detection of long-term learning-related consequences, our study suggests at least two practical interventions for newborns based on light exposure: ensuring sufficient light exposure to support normal brain development and cognitive functions and the potential to use ipRGC-targeted light therapies that may help compensate for known learning-associated genetic deficits in cortical synaptogenesis.
One limitation of the current study is that we did not assess how light affects the synaptogenesis of other types of neurons, like inhibitory neurons, monoaminergic neurons, and peptidergic neurons. However, one would expect that the mechanisms revealed in the current study can be extended to other neurons expressing oxytocin receptors. We also did not further identify whether the emerged synapses by light input during this developmental period are mainly synaptic connections within the local circuits or forming long range connectivity. The second limitation is we did not further investigate why the phenotypes observed in different brain areas show varying effect sizes. Whether it is correlated to the expression level of oxytocin receptors deserves further study. Other follow-up studies include investigating molecular mechanisms of how oxytocin shapes synaptogenesis at the specific developmental period, how the different sensory modalities contribute differently to synaptic development, and whether increased input from one modality can compensate for the loss of the other.

This study did not generate new unique reagents.
All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) and the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). Both male and female mice were used. All C57BL/6J mice used in this study were obtained from SPF (Beijing) Biotechnology Co., Ltd. Opn4 -/ - ; Opn4-cre ; Opn4 f/f ; Cnga3 -/- and Gnat1 -/- mice were generous gifts from King-Wai Yau at Johns Hopkins University. Oxt -/- and Oxt-IRES-cre mice were generous gifts from Xiang Yu from Peking University. Ai9 mice were generous gifts from Xiaohong Xu at Institute of Neuroscience and State Key Laboratory of Neuroscience in Shanghai. In all experiments, normal rearing mice were housed at a constant temperature with ad libitum access to standard rodent diet under an 8:00 to 20:00 12h:12h light/dark cycle (∼200 lux white ambient illumination). Its equivalent intensity for activating melanopsin at 480 nm monochrome light (about the peak absorption wavelength of melanopsin) is 2.36 × 10 6 photons μm -2 s -1 . For the dark rearing protocol, the pregnant dams were placed in a cage inside a light-proof box 1–4 days before delivery. Dams and neonatal mice were dark-reared until time of experiment.
CNO (Sigma Aldrich, UK) were dissolved in phosphate buffer saline to a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. In the hM3D experiments, i.p. injection of CNO (1 μg/g) was applied from P3 to P9 three times a day for mEPSC recording and P3 to P15 three times a day for Go/No-go behavior. In the hM4D experiments, i.p. injection of CNO (1 μg/g) was applied from P3 to P14 three times a day. 10 μM CNO was applied for whole cell recording in hM3d verification experiment.
Animals were sacrificed under deep anesthesia, and the brain was removed and placed for 1 min in cold (0 – 4°C) slicing solution containing (in mM): 125 NaCl, 1.25 KCl, 25 NaHCO 3 , 1.25 KH 2 PO 4 , 25 D-glucose, 0.1 CaCl 2 , 3 MgCl 2 , bubbled with 95% O 2 and 5% CO 2 . Coronal slices were cut at 300 μm thick using a vibrating microtome (Leica VT-1200S), and then allowed to recover for 45 min at 37°C in artificial cerebral spinal fluid (aCSF) containing (in mM): 125 NaCl, 1.25 KCl, 1.23 KH 2 PO 4 , 25 NaHCO 3 , 2 CaCl 2 , 1 MgCl 2 , and 25 D-glucose, bubbled with 95% O 2 and 5% CO 2 , adjusted to pH = 7.2, 300 – 310 mOsm.
After recovery, brain slices were transferred to the recording chamber perfused with oxygenized aCSF at room temperature. Whole-cell recordings were made from layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in cortex with a MultiClamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices). Signals were filtered at 1 kHz and sampled at 20 kHz using a Digidata 1440A digitizer (Molecular Devices). For mEPSC recordings, glass pipettes (resistance, 3–5 M) were loaded with internal solution containing (in mM): 135 CsMeSO 4 , 10 CsCl, 10 HEPES, 1 EGTA, 5 ATP-Mg and 0.5 GTP-Na (pH = 7.2, 300-310 mOsm), and all neurons were held at −70 mV without correcting junction potential. Cells with leak current more than 20 pA were excluded. Access resistances were monitored every 2 minutes and kept below 25 MΩ. If changes in access resistance exceed 20%, the recording is terminated. During recordings, 50 μM picrotoxin and 40 nM tetrodotoxin (TTX) were added to aCSF to block GABA A receptor and Na channels respectively. For experiments in Figures 3 E and 3F, brain slices were incubated in aCSF containing 1 μM oxytocin for an hour at RT before recording.
Data were analyzed using Clampfit 10.3 software. All recording traces were filtered with Gaussian filter to eliminate the line inferences. Then mEPSC events were detected by template matching method through fitting the kinetics of each event. The mEPSC amplitude of each cell was an average from all events. Frequency and average amplitude of mEPSC for each cell was then pooled into a population for each condition.
For retina electrophysiology, flat-mounted whole retinas were prepared, and green fluorescently labeled ipRGCs were identified with dim blue flash light. The extracellular bath solution was bicarbonate-buffered Ames medium (in mM): 120 NaCl, 22.6 NaHCO 3 , 3.1 KCl, 0.5 KH 2 PO 4 , 1.5 CaCl 2 , 1.2 MgSO 4 , 6 Glucose, equilibrated with 5% CO 2 and 95% O 2 and heated to 35°C (Warner Instruments Corp, TC-3448). For ipRGC perforated-patch recordings, glass pipettes (resistance, 4–5 M) were loaded with internal solution containing (in mM): 110 KCl, 13 KCl, 1 CaCl 2 , 2 MgCl 2 , 10 EGTA, 10 HEPES and 0.125 Amphotericin B (pH = 7.2). All recordings were in the perforated-patch, voltage-clamp mode at V hold = −80 mV, with junction potential corrected and series resistance monitored. Synaptic transmission was blocked pharmacologically in recordings from the whole retina. The 490 nm light stimulus was 100 ms LED flash at intensity of 1.3 × 10 7 photons μm -2 s -1 .
All reagents were purchased from Sigma, except TTX was from Dalian Refine Biochemical Items Company, oxytocin were synthesized by GL Biochem and Amphotericin B was from MCE (HY-B0221).
Opn4 +/+ ; Opn4 -/- ; melanopsin-only (MO) and no-light sensation triple knockout (TKO) mice at P9, P15, P30 were deeply anesthetized by pentobarbital (i.p. 100 mg kg −1 ). The following Golgi staining protocol was performed using the FD Rapid GolgiStain Kit (FD NeuroTechnologies, Inc). Coronal slices were cut at 150 μm using a cryostat microtome (Leica CM3050S) at -23°C to -24°C. The sections were examined and imaged under a Leica SP8 scanning microscope (SP8, Leica, Germany) or ZEISS LSM 980 with Airyscan 2 microscope (ZEISS, Germany). Images were analyzed by researchers blind to the experiment groups using ImageJ software. The quantification was all done with original Golgi staining images. A well-trained observer counted the number of spines based on the morphology including: filopodia, thin, stubby, branched and mushroom spines. To cross check the results, another observer randomly sampled the images and count again the number of spines. Both observers are blind to the animal genotypes and experiment conditions.
Single-Cell electroporation was used for labeling the pyramidal neurons at layer 2/3 of V1 and S1. Brain slices were prepared as electrophysiological experiments. The experiment was imaged under a Leica SP8 scanning microscope (SP8, Leica, Germany) or ZEISS LSM 980 with Airyscan 2 microscope (ZEISS, Germany). A glass pipette with a high resistance (12 – 15 MΩ) were filled with intracellular solution containing Alexa Fluor™ 488 hydrazide, sodium salt (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and mounted onto an electrode holder attached to a micromanipulator. Alexa Fluor™ 488 hydrazide was dissolved in intracellular solution to obtain a final concentration of 10 mM. After the brain slice was mounted under a 40 × water objective, the glass pipette was slowly lowered to gently touch the target neuron. Voltage pulses (100 rectangular pulses, −10 V, 0.5 ms duration at 50 Hz) was applied to load Alexa Fluor™ 488 hydrazide into the neuron. Voltage pulses for electroporation were generated with an isolated pulse stimulator (MODEL 2100, AM-SYSTEM INC). Then the neuron was imaged under 488 nm laser. After 10 mins of dye diffusing, the spines were labeled clearly with fluorescence, and the brain slice was transferred to 4% PFA for tissue fixation, which was then imaged under a Leica SP8 scanning microscope (SP8, Leica, Germany) or ZEISS LSM 980 with Airyscan 2 microscope (ZEISS, Germany). Images were analyzed by researchers blind to the experiment groups using ImageJ software. The quantification was all done with original fluorescent images. A well-trained observer counted the number of spines based on the morphology including: filopodia, thin, stubby, branched and mushroom spines. To cross check the results, another observer randomly sampled the images and count again the number of spines. Both observers are blind to the animal experiment conditions.
The following fluorescent viral tools were employed in the current study: AAV2/2-hSyn-DIO-mOPN4-P2A-EGFP were used to Cre-dependently express the melanopsin in Opn4-cre ; Opn4 -/- mice ipRGCs, and AAV2/2-hSyn-DIO-GFP were used for sham control. AAV2/2-hEF1a-DIO-membrane-tdTomato-WPRE-pA were used to Cre-dependently express the membrane-fused tdTomato in Opn4-cre mice ipRGCs. Herpes simplex virus (HSV-GFP) was used for anterograde trans-synaptic tracing. AAV2/5-hEF1a-DIO-H2B-EGFP-T2A-TVA and AAV2/5-hEF1a-DIO-RVG were used to Cre-dependently express membrane-fused TVA protein, which enabled the infection of modified rabies virus (RV), and G protein, which reinstated trans-synaptic capability of RV. RV-EnvA-▵G-dsRed was used in conjunction with aforementioned helper viruses for retrograde trans-synaptic tracing. AAV2/9-EF1α-DIO-EYFP was used for labeling SON oxytocin neurons in RV tracing experiment. Alexa fluor 647-conjugated cholera toxin subunit B (CTB-647, Thermo Fisher) were used for anterograde tracing. AAV2/2-hSyn-DIO-hM4D(Gi)-mCherry-WPRE-pA were used to Cre-dependently express the hM4D in Opn4-cre ; Opn4 -/- mice ipRGCs, and AAV2/2-hSyn-DIO-GFP were used for sham control. AAV2/2-Syn-cre were used to conditionally knockout melanopsin in Opn4 f/f mice ipRGCs, and AAV2/2-Syn-flp were used as sham control. AAV2/9-hSyn-DIO-hM3D(Gq)-mCherry-WPRE-pA were used to Cre-dependently express the hM3D in Opn4 -/- ; Oxt-IRES-cre mice OXT neurons, and AAV2/9-hSyn-FLEX-membrane-tdTomato-WPRE-pA were used as sham control, which was also used to Cre-dependently express the membrane-fused tdTomato in Oxt-IRES-cre mice OXT neurons. AAV2/5-hEF1a-DIO-H2B-eGFP-T2A-TVA, AAV2/5-hEF1a-DIO-RVG and RV-EnvA-▵G-dsRed were obtained from BrainVTA (Wuhan, China). AAV2/2-hSyn-DIO-GFP, AAV2/2-Syn-cre and AAV2/2-Syn-flp were obtained from WZ Biosciences Inc. All other AAV tools were prepared by Shanghai Taitool Bioscience Co.Ltd. To speed up the AAV virus expression in pups, 30 ug/ml doxorubicin (Dox) was mixed with virus and injected into the targeted areas ( Gong et al., 2021 15. Gong, H. ∙ Yuan, N. ∙ Shen, Z. ... Transduction catalysis: doxorubicin amplifies rAAV-mediated gene expression in the cortex of higher-order vertebrates iScience. 2021; 24 :102685 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (7) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The mouse pups were anesthetized by wet ice ( Gombash Lampe et al., 2014 14. Gombash Lampe, S.E. ∙ Kaspar, B.K. ∙ Foust, K.D. Intravenous injections in neonatal mice J. Vis. Exp. 2014; 93 :e52037 Google Scholar ). To avoid asphyxia by water, a piece of aluminum foil was placed between ice and pups. After around 2 minutes, the fully anesthetized pup was transferred to an ice-filled glass dish for subsequent injection procedure. The eyelid was opened by the tip of a 26G needle and the cornea was penetrated immediately followed by the injection of 0.5 μl virus into the space between the lens and the retina using a World Precision Instrument Nanofil syringe (07K with 36G Blunt Needle). To minimize the damage to vision, the tip of needle or syringe was operated carefully without touching the retina and lens. The injected pups with noticeable bleeding or damage to the retina or cornea were excluded from further experiments. Afterward, the pup was placed at a heating mat for revival before transferring back to its home cage. Care was taken to make esure the pup is coated with bedding and/or nestlet and it was reaccepted by the dam immediately when the pup began to breath. In the melanopsin-SAP experiment, the P0 pups were intraocular injected with melanopsin-specific saporin (50 ng/eye) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and were dark reared to P11. To verify the efficiency of melanopsin-SAP, a group of those pups were intraocularly injected by CTB-647 (Cholera Toxin Subunit B (Recombinant), Alexa Fluor™ 647 Conjugate, Thermo Fisher) after 6 days and were sacrificed 4 days after CTB injection. The efficiency and off-target side effect of melanopsin-SAP were also verified at P9 by Brn3a and P15 by melanopsin immunostaining.
The mouse pups were anesthetized by wet ice as described above. The head of the pup was fixed by the rubber tip of the ear bar. After the bregma and lambda point were aligned, the skull above the target area was opened by a 26G needle and virus was delivered into the brain at the rate of 30 nl/min at the following stereotaxic coordinates: PVN (AP: +0.2 mm from bregma; ML: ±0.2 mm; DV: −3.0 mm); SON (AP: -0.3 mm from bregma; ML: ±1.25 mm; DV: −3.55 mm). After completion of the injection, injection pipette was left in the brain for another 5 mins before slowly withdrawn and the scalp was glued back. Afterward, the pup was placed at a heating mat for revival before transferring back to its home cage. Care was taken to make ensure the pup is coated with bedding and/or nestlet and it was reaccepted by the dam immediately when the pup began to breath.
To dilate the pupils, the dilating eye drop (1% w/v Atropine and 5% w/v Phenylephrine hydrochloride) was applied. After the pupils were fully dilated, mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital (i.p. 100 mg/kg). Eye gel (5% sodium carboxymethyl cellulose) was applied to prevent eyes from drying. The eyeball was then penetrated at the edge of cornea with the tip of a 26G needle under the stereoscope to release the ocular pressure. Immediately afterward, 1.5 μl virus was injected into the space between the lens and the retina using a World Precision Instrument Nanofil syringe (07K with 36G Blunt Needle). To minimize the damage to vision, the tip of needle or syringe was operated carefully without touching the retina and lens, and the ones with noticeable bleeding or damage to the retina or cornea were excluded from further experiments. Following surgery, mice were allowed to recover from anesthesia on a heating mat before being returned to their home cages. In the anterograde tracing experiment, mice were binocularly injected with 1.5 μl HSV, and then sacrificed for tracing imaging 4 days after HSV injection. In the adult melanopsin rescue experiment, Opn4-Cre ; Opn4 -/- mice were binocularly injected with 1.5 μl AAV2/2-hSyn-DIO-mOPN4-EGFP or AAV2/2-EF1α-DIO-EYFP. In the adult melanopsin knockout experiment, Opn4 f/f mice ( Wang et al., 2017 50. Wang, Q. ∙ Yue, W.W.S. ∙ Jiang, Z. ... Synergistic signaling by light and acetylcholine in mouse iris sphincter muscle Curr. Biol. 2017; 27 :1791-1800.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ) were binocularly injected with 1.5 μl AAV2/2-hSyn-cre or AAV2/2-hSyn-flp.
Adult mouse was anesthetized with pentobarbital (i.p. 100 mg/kg) and mounted on a stereotaxic apparatus (Shenzhen RWD Life Science, China). Erythromycin ointment (Guangdong Hengjian Pharmaceutical Co.,Ltd, China) was applied to protect the eyes. The scalp was shaved and cleansed, then a linear incision on the skin was made to expose the skull which was subsequently cleaned with a cotton swab dipped in PBS. The skull above the target area was drilled open and virus was delivered into the brain at the rate of 30 nl/min at the following stereotaxic coordinates: PVN (AP: -0.6 mm from bregma; ML: ±1.0 mm; DV: −4.8 mm, 10°); SON (AP: -1.25 mm from bregma; ML: ±0.6 mm; DV: −5.2 mm). After completion of the injection, injection pipette was left in the brain for another 10 mins before slowly withdrawn and the scalp was sutured back. In the mono-retrograde tracing experiment from PVN oxytocin neurons, 100 nl virus mixture of AAV2/5-hEF1a-DIO-RVG and AAV2/5-hEF1a-DIO-H2B-EGFP-T2A-TVA (2:1) were injected into PVN of Oxt-IRES-Cre mouse. After three weeks, RV-EnvA-▵G-dsRed were injected into the same site. In the retrograde tracing experiment from SON oxytocin or, 100 nl virus mixture of AAV2/5-hEF1a-DIO-RVG and AAV2/5-hEF1a-DIO-H2B-EGFP-T2A-TVA (2:1) were injected into SON of Oxt-IRES-Cre mouse. After three weeks, RV-EnvA-▵G-dsRed were injected into the same site. In the multi-retrograde tracing experiment from PVN oxytocin neurons to retina, 100 nl virus mixture of AAV2/5-hEF1a-DIO-RVG and AAV2/5-hEF1a-DIO-H2B-EGFP-T2A-TVA (2:1) were injected into PVN of Oxt-IRES-Cre mouse, meanwhile 100 nL virus mixture of AAV2/5-hEF1a-DIO-RVG and AAV2/9-EF1α-DIO-EYFP (1:1) were injected into SON of the same animal. After three weeks, RV-EnvA-▵G-dsRed were injected into PVN. Mice were sacrificed for tracing imaging one week after the injection of RV-EnvA-▵G-dsRed.
Pups were raised under LD (12/12) cycle and CSF were obtained in the afternoon under room light. To collect mouse CSF samples, P9 Opn4 +/+ and Opn4 -/- mice were deeply anesthetized by Avertin (450 mg/kg, Sigma-Aldrich), and mounted on a stereotaxic system (Shenzhen RWD Life Science, China). Mice were placed on a heating pad during surgery to keep the body temperature. Incision was made in occipital skin, then the subcutaneous tissue and muscles were separated by blunt dissection with forceps to expose the dura mater of the cisterna magna. A sterilized glass pipette was used to penetrate into the citerna magna through the dura mater, and CSF was withdrawn at a rate of 400 nL/min. Approximately 2 μL of CSF was collected per mouse pup. The collected CSF in an Eppendorf tube was then placed immediately in liquid nitrogen and then stored in a -80°C freezer. Add 120 μL methanol per 40 μL CSF sample to achieve efficient removal of sample matrix. Samples were vortexed briefly (5–10 sec), and then spun at 14,000 RPM for 15 minutes (at room temperature). The supernatant was concentrated and dried, and then diluted with 40 μL 0.1% Formic acid solution (FA) and 0.1% rat plasma.
A 40 μL of oxytocin standard solution or CSF sample was injected into a ExionLC™ AD ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) (AB Sciex, Framingham, MA, USA) and separated on a Shim-pack GIST C18 column (2 μm, 50 × 2.1 mm) (Shimadzu, Columbia, MD, USA) with a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min at 40°C. Mobile phase A was water and mobile phase B was acetonitrile. It was started with 5% mobile phase B for 0.5 min, then increased to 60% within 1 min, kept constant 60% for 2 min, reduced to 5% at 4 min, and kept constant until the end of the run at 8 min. Autosampler temperature was kept at 10 °C. The LC eluent was introduced into an AB Sciex 6500+ quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer (QTRAPMS) (AB Sciex, Framingham, MA, USA) for multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) using positive ion mode with electrospray ionization (ESI). Final MRM parameters were as follows: Curtain gas (20 psi), collision gas (high), IonSpray voltage (5500 V), source temperature (550 °C), ion source gas 1 (50 psi), ion source gas 2 (50 psi), declustering potential (60 V), entrance potential (5 V). Quantification was performed by MRM of the protonated precursor molecular ions [M + H]+ and the related product ions. The resolutions of quadrupole Q1 mass (precursor ion) and Q3 mass (product ion) were set at unit. For MRM scan of OXT, ion pairs 1007.4 → 723.4 m/z were monitored for quantitation, while ion pairs 1007.4 → 285.0 m/z were monitored for confirmation. Chromatograms and mass spectral data were acquired and processed using Analyst®1.6.3 software (AB Sciex, Framingham, MA, USA).
Mice were deeply anesthetized by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of pentobarbital (100 mg kg −1 ), and then perfused with chilled PBS, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. Brains were removed and immersed in the same fixative solution (4% PFA in PBS) overnight at 4 °C, then were subsequently incubated in 30% (wt/vol) sucrose in PBS for 24h at 4 °C. Coronal brain slices 40 μm thick were prepared using a cryostat microtome (Leica CM3050S) at -20 °C and collected into a 24-well plate. After a PBS wash (three times within 5 min), slices were blocked with blocked with blocking solution (PBS containing 5% BSA, 5% goat serum and 0.5% Triton X-100) for 1h at room temperature, and then incubated with the appropriate primary antibody for 24h at 4 °C. The primary antibodies used in the present study are as follows: rabbit anti-cFos (Synaptic Systems, 226003; 1:5,000); rabbit anti-oxytocin (Abcam, ab212193,1:500); rabbit anti-melanopsin (Advanced Targeting System, AB-N39, 1:700); mouse anti-Brn3A (Sigma-Aldrich, MAB1585, 1:100); goat anti-PSD95 (Abcam, ab12093, 1:100); guinea pig anti-Synaptophysin 1 (Synaptic Systems, SYSY-101004, 1:500). After a PBS wash, slices were incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Secondary antibodies used in the present study were purchased from Thermo Fisher. Then the slices were wash with PBS, collected on gelatin-coated slides, air-dried, and mounted with glycerol. Finally, the sections were examined and imaged under a Leica SP8 scanning microscope (SP8, Leica, Germany). Fluorescence signals were detected by setting a threshold for the fluorescence intensity as the mean(background)+3 ∗ SD(background). The cFos positive nuclei were then detected by setting a constrained range on the area of the signal as the number of pixels according to the average size of nuclei. Colocalization was detected by researchers who were blind to the experiment conditions and identified as oxytocin signals (cytosol) wrapping cFos signals (nuclei).
Adult mice (2-4 months) were anesthetized by pentobarbital (100 mg kg −1 ). Ophthalmic ointment (Bepanthen, Bayer) was applied to both eyes to prevent damage from dehydration during surgery. Dental acrylic (Super-Bond, C&B) was used to fix the head plate onto the skull after removing the scalp and tissues. Mice were transferred to a heating pad for awake. Mice were prepared for experiment after two days’ recovery.
Mice were water-deprived 2 days before training start. The body weight of each mouse was recorded every day. The body weight was maintained from 70 to 85% of initial weight to keep both the health of the mice and their motivation to lick for water. During training, the mouse was head-fixed and stayed in an acrylic tube within a sound and light-proof box. Tongue licks were detected by an iron tube connected with a custom-made capacitive sensor ( Chen and Li, 2017 8. Chen, X. ∙ Li, H. ArControl : an Arduino-based comprehensive behavioral platform with real-time performance Front. Behav. Neurosci. 2017; 11 :244 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ). Training ended when the mouse stopped licking for several minutes ( Lee et al., 2012 29. Lee, S.H. ∙ Kwan, A.C. ∙ Zhang, S. ... Activation of specific interneurons improves V1 feature selectivity and visual perception Nature. 2012; 488 :379-383 Crossref Scopus (426) PubMed Google Scholar ). The entire behavioral experiment contained three phases: habituation, conditioning, discrimination ( O’Connor et al., 2010 36. O’Connor, D.H. ∙ Clack, N.G. ∙ Huber, D. ... Vibrissa-based object localization in head-fixed mice J. Neurosci. 2010; 30 :1947-1967 Crossref Scopus (228) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The habituation step typically last 2 days. Mice were head-fixed at the training instrument and given ∼4 μl water for each lick. The conditioning step typically last 2 days. Mice were trained to lick for water rewards in response to a 100-ms pure tone at high frequency (8944 Hz, go cue). Mice licking during the following 500 ms after the pure tone start (response window) was rewarded with ∼4 μl of water (hit). If no lick was detected during the response window (miss), water reward would also be given at the end of the response window. When the number of hits reached 150 within 30 min, the mouse was advanced to the next step.
For discrimination step, a 100-ms pure tone at low frequency (4913 Hz, no-go cue) was added into the training. Mice licking within the response window (500 ms) of go trials was rewarded with water, whereas licking within the response window of no-go trials was punished with a mild air puff (200 ms) and a longer inter-trial interval (4 s, timeout). Mice were neither rewarded nor punished for no licking within the response window of go (miss) and no-go (CR, correct reject) trials. The go and no-go trials were randomly interleaved, but the same stimulus was never repeated more than 3 times. The performance of mice was measured by discriminability (d'), which was quantified by: 𝑑 ′ = 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑣 ⁡ ( ℎ ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑡 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑒 ) – 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑣 ⁡ ( 𝐹 ⁢ 𝐴 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑒 )
where norminv is the inverse of the cumulative normal distribution function ( Andermann et al., 2010 2. Andermann, M.L. ∙ Kerlin, A.M. ∙ Reid, R.C. Chronic cellular imaging of mouse visual cortex during operant behavior and passive viewing Front. Cell. Neurosci. 2010; 4 :3 PubMed Google Scholar ; Green and Swets, 1966 19. Green, D.M. ∙ Swets, J.A. Signal Detection Theory and Psychophysics Wiley, 1966 Google Scholar ). H i t r a t e = n u m b e r o f h i t s n u m b e r o f g o c u e and F A r a t e = n u m b e r o f F A s n u m b e r o f n o − g o c u e . Higher d' values indicate better performance in sound frequency discrimination.
Mice were trained 2 sessions per day. After mice reached a stable performance for at least 5 sessions, data was fitted by Sigmoidal function to get the threshold of trials (T threshold ), which stand for the number of trials when the mouse can discriminate the task (d' ≥ 1). Mice failed to reach the threshold (d' ≥ 1) within 20 sessions were abandoned from experiment.
All of the sound discrimination tasks were performed in the dark.
P9, P10, P12, P14 and 2 months old C57BL/6J mice were deeply anesthetized by Avertin (450 mg/kg, Sigma-Aldrich), and then eyelids were opened with a scalpel. During the experiment, the anesthetized animal was kept on a warming blanket and eyes were kept wet to avoid cataract. Experiments were done in a Faraday cage. The recording electrode was put tightly against the center of the cornea. A ground electrode was inserted into subcutaneous space of the tail and a reference electrode was inserted into subcutaneous space of the head. Calibrated 50 ms flashes of 490 nm LED light (5.2 × 10 6 photons μm -2 s -1 ) was flashed in front of the eye. Data acquisition was carried out by a differential amplifier (AM-SYSTEM INC) and Digital 1440A (Molecular Devices). Data were analyzed with Clampfit 10.3 software.
Head-fixed mice were used for pupillary light reflex. Head-plate implantation is the same as in Go/No-go behavioral experiment. All PLR experiments were performed during the day: from 3 hours after light-on to 3 hours before light-off with > 1 h dark adaptation. To measure the diameter of pupil, an infrared CCD camera and a 470 nm LED (10 s, 3.51 × 10 7 photons μm -2 s -1 ) were placed 1 cm in front of the cornea. Videos for contralateral eyes were recorded at a frame rate of 5 Hz and was analyzed with ImageJ software. The pupil area was measured at maximum constriction after light stimulation begin.
For all experiments, unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test or two-way ANOVA followed by multiple comparison tests were used (∗ p < 0.05, ∗∗ p < 0.01, ∗∗∗ p < 0.001; N.S,. no significant difference). Statistical analyses were carried out using MATLAB. Normality test has been done for all data. Data sets with small sample sizes and non-significant normal distribution were further applied bootstrap to perform statistical tests for verification. The bootstrap procedure for comparing two data sets Hypothesis. H0: the two data sets come from the same underlying distribution. H1: the two data sets come from two different distributions. We compute the difference of means between the two distributions and compare it to the difference in means by randomly sampling data points from the full data set (with replacement) to create two bootstrap samples of the same size as each of the two measured samples. This procedure is repeated 1000000 times, creating 1000000 bootstrap samples and mean differences. The original mean is compared to the distribution of the 1000000 means, and the probability to have such a mean difference (above or below) is computed. This probability is the raw Bootstrap p-value for the single comparison of the two data sets. Significance levels are 0.05 for one-tailed and 0.025 for two-tailed comparisons. Then adjustment for multiple comparisons are done.
