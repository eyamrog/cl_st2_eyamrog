Title: Evolutionary Persistence of DNA Methylation for Millions of Years after Ancient Loss of a De Novo Methyltransferase


Abstract: Summary

Cytosine methylation of DNA is a widespread modification of DNA that plays numerous critical roles. In the yeast Cryptococcus neoformans , CG methylation occurs in transposon-rich repeats and requires the DNA methyltransferase Dnmt5. We show that Dnmt5 displays exquisite maintenance-type specificity in vitro and in vivo and utilizes similar in vivo cofactors as the metazoan maintenance methylase Dnmt1. Remarkably, phylogenetic and functional analysis revealed that the ancestral species lost the gene for a de novo methylase, DnmtX, between 50–150 mya. We examined how methylation has persisted since the ancient loss of DnmtX. Experimental and comparative studies reveal efficient replication of methylation patterns in C. neoformans , rare stochastic methylation loss and gain events, and the action of natural selection. We propose that an epigenome has been propagated for >50 million years through a process analogous to Darwinian evolution of the genome.

Section: Introduction

Methylation of cytosine on its fifth carbon (5mC) in DNA is found in all domains of life ( Bird, 2002 5. Bird, A. DNA methylation patterns and epigenetic memory Genes Dev. 2002; 16 :6-21 Crossref Scopus (5730) PubMed Google Scholar ). The DNA of all known vertebrates and land plants harbor this modification, likely because of its critical function in genome defense ( Zemach et al., 2010 65. Zemach, A. ∙ McDaniel, I.E. ∙ Silva, P. ... Genome-wide evolutionary analysis of eukaryotic DNA methylation Science. 2010; 328 :916-919 Crossref Scopus (1324) PubMed Google Scholar ). 5mC is initially deposited by de novo DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) that act on unmethylated substrates. In the context of palindromic sequence arrangements (e.g., CG and CHG) in which cytosines on both strands are methylated, this initial activity can then be “remembered” by maintenance enzymes that function on hemimethylated DNA produced by DNA replication ( Law and Jacobsen, 2010 35. Law, J.A. ∙ Jacobsen, S.E. Establishing, maintaining and modifying DNA methylation patterns in plants and animals Nat. Rev. Genet. 2010; 11 :204-220 Crossref Scopus (2854) PubMed Google Scholar ). One example of this division of labor is found in the mammalian DNA methylation system. Here, de novo methylation is principally catalyzed by the Dnmt3a/b-Dnmt3L complex ( Du et al., 2015 14. Du, J. ∙ Johnson, L.M. ∙ Jacobsen, S.E. ... DNA methylation pathways and their crosstalk with histone methylation Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2015; 16 :519-532 Crossref Scopus (684) PubMed Google Scholar ). Once the DNA methylation mark is established during germline and embryonic development, it is then maintained by the Dnmt1 enzyme in association with UHRF1, a protein that recognizes H3K9me and hemimethylated 5mC ( Bostick et al., 2007; Du et al., 2015; Law and Jacobsen, 2010 6. Bostick, M. ∙ Kim, J.K. ∙ Estève, P.-O. ... UHRF1 plays a role in maintaining DNA methylation in mammalian cells Science. 2007; 317 :1760-1764 Crossref Scopus (1082) PubMed Google Scholar 14. Du, J. ∙ Johnson, L.M. ∙ Jacobsen, S.E. ... DNA methylation pathways and their crosstalk with histone methylation Nat. Rev. Mol.

Rev. Genet. 2010; 11 :204-220 Crossref Scopus (2854) PubMed Google Scholar ). This division of labor between de novo and maintenance enzymes extends to land plants ( Bronner et al., 2019 7. Bronner, C. ∙ Alhosin, M. ∙ Hamiche, A. ... Coordinated Dialogue between UHRF1 and DNMT1 to Ensure Faithful Inheritance of Methylated DNA Patterns Genes (Basel). 2019; 10 :E65 Crossref Scopus (71) PubMed Google Scholar ), although Dnmt3 appears to have been lost in angiosperms and replaced by other de novo enzymes ( Yaari et al., 2019 63. Yaari, R. ∙ Katz, A. ∙ Domb, K. ... RdDM-independent de novo and heterochromatin DNA methylation by plant CMT and DNMT3 orthologs Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :1613 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ). DNA methylation is essential for development and plays critical roles in silencing of transposable elements, chromosome stability, monoallelic gene expression, and gene silencing ( Jones, 2012 29. Jones, P.A. Functions of DNA methylation: islands, start sites, gene bodies and beyond Nat. Rev. Genet. 2012; 13 :484-492 Crossref Scopus (4356) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, Dnmt3a is a commonly mutated driver gene in acute myeloid leukemia ( Brunetti et al., 2017 8. Brunetti, L. ∙ Gundry, M.C. ∙ Goodell, M.A. DNMT3A in Leukemia Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Med. 2017; 7 :a030320 Crossref Scopus (138) PubMed Google Scholar ) and mutations in Dnmt3b cause the autosomal recessive disease immunodeficiency, centromeric region instability, facial anomalies (ICF) syndrome ( Walton et al., 2014 59. Walton, E.L. ∙ Francastel, C. ∙ Velasco, G. Dnmt3b Prefers Germ Line Genes and Centromeric Regions: Lessons from the ICF Syndrome and Cancer and Implications for Diseases Biology (Basel). 2014; 3 :578-605 PubMed Google Scholar ).
While nearly all opisthokonts that have DNA methylation encode at least two DNMT homologs in their genomes, some, curiously, have only one ( Bewick et al., 2017, 2019; Rošić et al., 2018 3. Bewick, A.J. ∙ Vogel, K.J. ∙ Moore, A.J. ... Evolution of DNA Methylation across Insects Mol. Biol. Evol. 2017; 34 :654-665 PubMed Google Scholar 4. Bewick, A.J. ∙ Hofmeister, B.T. ∙ Powers, R.A. ... Diversity of cytosine methylation across the fungal tree of life Nat. Ecol. Evol. 2019; 3 :479-490 Crossref Scopus (72) PubMed Google Scholar 53. Rošić, S. ∙ Amouroux, R. ∙ Requena, C.E. ... Evolutionary analysis indicates that DNA alkylation damage is a byproduct of cytosine DNA methyltransferase activity Nat. Genet. 2018; 50 :452-459 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ). One such species is the human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans , a basidiomycetous yeast that possesses symmetric CG methylation at transposon-rich centromeric and subtelomeric regions ( Huff and Zilberman, 2014 27. Huff, J.T. ∙ Zilberman, D. Dnmt1-independent CG methylation contributes to nucleosome positioning in diverse eukaryotes Cell. 2014; 156 :1286-1297 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (131) PubMed Google Scholar ). This methylation is dependent on the predicted cytosine DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) Dnmt5, encoded by the DMT5 gene ( Huff and Zilberman, 2014 27. Huff, J.T. ∙ Zilberman, D. Dnmt1-independent CG methylation contributes to nucleosome positioning in diverse eukaryotes Cell. 2014; 156 :1286-1297 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (131) PubMed Google Scholar ), a gene found previously to be required for fitness of C. neoformans during infection ( Liu et al., 2008 43. Liu, O.W. ∙ Chun, C.D. ∙ Chow, E.D. ... Systematic genetic analysis of virulence in the human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans. Cell. 2008; 135 :174-188 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (340) PubMed Google Scholar ). The Dnmt5 family is characterized by an N-terminal chromodomain (CD) followed by a cytosine methyltransferase catalytic domain, a RING finger, and a domain related to those of SNF2-type ATPases ( Figure 1 A). This putative enzyme is widespread in fungi and in green algae, several of which have been shown to have CG methylation that impacts nucleosome positioning ( Huff and Zilberman, 2014 27. Huff, J.T. ∙ Zilberman, D. Dnmt1-independent CG methylation contributes to nucleosome positioning in diverse eukaryotes Cell. 2014; 156 :1286-1297 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (131) PubMed Google Scholar ). 5mC in C. neoformans is concentrated at transposable element-rich repeats; it likely functions in transposon silencing as a sister species, Cryptococcus deuterogattii , has lost all active transposons, and concomitantly lost 5mC and displays inactivating mutations in the DMT5 gene ( Yadav et al., 2018a 64. Yadav, V. ∙ Sun, S. ∙ Billmyre, R.B. ... RNAi is a critical determinant of centromere evolution in closely related fungi Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115 :3108-3113 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar ). Below we describe our investigations of C. neoformans Dnmt5.

Section: Results

In C. neoformans , regions of the genome decorated with 5mC coincide with those we reported to display H3K9me ( Dumesic et al., 2015; Huff and Zilberman, 2014 15. Dumesic, P.A. ∙ Homer, C.M. ∙ Moresco, J.J. ... Product binding enforces the genomic specificity of a yeast polycomb repressive complex Cell. 2015; 160 :204-218 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (100) PubMed Google Scholar 27. Huff, J.T. ∙ Zilberman, D. Dnmt1-independent CG methylation contributes to nucleosome positioning in diverse eukaryotes Cell. 2014; 156 :1286-1297 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (131) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, we tested whether the CD of Dnmt5 recognizes this mark. Binding of a purified fragment containing the CD to a commercial array of modified human histone peptides yielded signals with H3K9me-containing peptides as well as those containing H3K27me ( Figures S1 A and S1B). However, because H3 in C. neoformans differs from the human H3 sequence around lysine 27, we assessed the binding capability of the chromodomain using fluorescence polarization and peptides corresponding to C. neoformans H3 sequences ( Figures 1 B and S1 C). Binding to H3K9me (K d = 1.5 μM for H3K9me3) was substantially stronger than binding to H3K27me (K d > 250 μM), suggesting that H3K9me is the principal binding partner of the CD.
To assess whether H3K9me affects 5mC, we deleted the gene encoding the only H3K9 methyltransferase in C. neoformans , Clr4 ( clr4 Δ) ( Dumesic et al., 2015 15. Dumesic, P.A. ∙ Homer, C.M. ∙ Moresco, J.J. ... Product binding enforces the genomic specificity of a yeast polycomb repressive complex Cell. 2015; 160 :204-218 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (100) PubMed Google Scholar ). 5mC was assayed by digestion of genomic DNA with a methylation-sensitive enzyme (HpyCH4IV; ÂCGT) followed by Southern hybridization. Based on published maps of 5mC in wild-type C. neoformans , we designed a probe directed to a unique region of centromere 13 ( Figure 1 C, probe U). In addition, another probe recognizing repetitive centromeric sequences (probe R) was created to analyze the distribution of 5mC across several centromeric sites at once.
In the regions probed, 5mC levels are markedly reduced in the clr4 Δ strain ( Figure 1 D), while the dmt5 Δ strain as well as strains harboring mutations in catalytic residues in the either the DNMT catalytic domain or ATPase domain display no 5mC ( Figures 1 D and S2 A). Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis of FLAG-Dnmt5 demonstrated that its recruitment to H3K9me domains is dramatically reduced ( Figure S2 B). In contrast, a mutation of the Dnmt5 chromodomain that abolishes its binding to H3K9me ( W87A , Y90A ) has only a minor effect on 5mC, suggesting that other H3K9me-dependent factors contribute to 5mC levels ( Figures 1 E and S2 C). The heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) family includes several conserved proteins that, by binding to H3K9me, participate in heterochromatin formation and can contribute to 5mC methylation ( Bannister et al., 2001; Lachner et al., 2001; Lewis et al., 2010 1.

Lewis, Z.A. ∙ Adhvaryu, K.K. ∙ Honda, S. ... DNA methylation and normal chromosome behavior in Neurospora depend on five components of a histone methyltransferase complex, DCDC PLoS Genet. 2010; 6 :e1001196 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar ). In C. neoformans , we identified a single HP1 ortholog (CNAG_03458), which we named Swi6 based on its characterized ortholog in fission yeast ( Figure S2 D). While the swi6 Δ mutant marginally impacts 5mC, a swi6 Δ dmt5 - W87A , Y90A double mutant reduces the levels of 5mC to those seen in the clr4 Δ strain ( Figure 1 E). Immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry and coimmunoprecipitation analysis revealed that Swi6 and Dnmt5 physically associate ( Figures S2 E and S2F) suggesting that H3K9me promotes 5mC by recruiting Dnmt5 in two ways: via the CD of Dnmt5 and via HP1 ( Figure S2 G).
The residual 5mC seen in cells lacking H3K9me led us to seek additional factors involved in DNA methylation. C. neoformans possesses one Uhrf1-like protein that contains an SRA domain (CNAG_00677, Figure 1 F) but lacks the Tudor H3K9me reader and RING E3 ligase domains found in its human ortholog. Using native gel electrophoresis, we tested the ability of recombinant C. neoformans Uhrf1 ( Figure S3 A) to bind labeled DNA that is unmethylated, hemimethylated, or symmetrically methylated at six CG dinucleotides. This experiment demonstrated that Uhrf1 selectively binds hemimethylated DNA ( Figure 1 F; multiple complexes seen likely reflects multiple molecules of Uhrf1 bound), a result confirmed by competition experiments ( Figure S3 B). The absence of Uhrf1 ( uhf1 Δ) has almost no detectable impact on 5mC in vivo but modestly alters 5mC patterns at sites probed when combined with a loss of Clr4 ( clr4 Δ uhf1 Δ) ( Figure 1 G).
To assay these genotypes genome-wide, we performed whole-genome bisulfite-sequencing (WGBS) of DNA extracted from wild-type, dmt5 Δ, clr4Δ , uhf1 Δ, and clr4 Δ uhf1 Δ strains ( Figure 1 H). The total number of symmetrically methylated CG dinucleotides, which is reduced to 31% in clr4 Δ, drops to 11% in the clr4 Δ uhf1 Δ double mutant ( Figures 1 I and 1J; n.b.: no non-CG methylation was observed). This analysis indicates that Uhrf1 and Clr4 promote 5mC through two parallel pathways ( Figure 1 J).
C. neoformans Dnmt5 functions with a Uhrf1 homolog and itself recognizes H3K9me, which are features reminiscent of the mammalian maintenance methylation system. We therefore tested whether Dnmt5 has the substrate specificity expected of a maintenance enzyme. We expressed and purified full-length Dnmt5 in S. cerevisiae . We performed methyltransferase assays using a S-[ 3 H-methyl]-adenosyl-methionine donor and synthetic 20 bp double-stranded DNA oligonucleotide substrates that harbored six CG sites. The substrate was either unmethylated, hemimethylated at all CG sites on the Watson strand, hemimethylated at all CG sites on the Crick strand, or symmetrically methylated on both stands. In the absence of ATP, no activity was observed on any substrate, as compared to control reactions that lacked Dnmt5 ( Figure 2 A). However, in the presence of ATP, methyltransferase activity was observed only on hemimethylated substrates with apparent catalytic rates comparable to that of human Dnmt1 ( Figures 2 A and 2B) ( Pradhan et al., 1999 50. Pradhan, S. ∙ Bacolla, A. ∙ Wells, R.D. ... Recombinant human DNA (cytosine-5) methyltransferase. I. Expression, purification, and comparison of de novo and maintenance methylation J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274 :33002-33010 Crossref Scopus (507) PubMed Google Scholar ). Endpoint assays with the unmethylated substrate did not reveal any activity above background on unmodified DNA; under the same conditions, we observed methyltransferase activity on the hemimethylated substrate that was ∼1,300-fold over background ( Figures S3 C and S3D). In addition, Dnmt5 activity is specific for CG dinucleotides because no activity was detected on DNA substrates containing CHG motifs instead of CG motifs, regardless of cytosine methylation state ( Figure S3 E).
Because the chromodomain of Dnmt5 recognizes H3K9me, we asked whether de novo activity could be detected when trimethylated H3K9 peptide was added to the in vitro reaction. Rates on hemimethylated substrates were comparable in the presence of methylated or unmethylated H3K9 peptide, and no activity was detected on unmethylated DNA ( Figures 2 C and 2D). We also tested whether recombinant Uhrf1 and Swi6 could trigger a de novo activity when added to the reactions, but none could be detected ( Figure S3 F). We conclude that Dnmt5 is a maintenance enzyme in vitro with activity on hemimethylated substrates and no detectable activity on unmethylated substrates under a range of conditions.
Although Dnmt5 displays the in vitro substrate specificity expected for a maintenance-type enzyme, it may function in vivo with cofactors that could change its properties. A way to address this question is to remove Dnmt5 from a cell, allow methylation to be lost, and then re-introduce the enzyme. If Dnmt5 behaves as a maintenance enzyme in cells, DNA methylation should not be globally restored because its hemimethylated substrate would be lost.
We placed the gene for Dnmt5 under the control of a galactose-inducible promoter ( Figure 3 A; pGAL-DMT5 ). This allele was tagged at its N terminus with a 2XFLAG epitope tag. In the first series of experiments, the corresponding targeting construct was introduced by transformation and recipient cells were selected under conditions repressive for the pGAL7 promoter ( R ). After induction of the Dnmt5 protein using the inducer galactose for 20 (I 20 ) or 45 generations (I 45 ), we were not able to detect 5mC by Southern hybridization, although expression of the construct was evident ( Figure 3 A). To assess if the pGAL-DMT5 allele is functional, the targeting construct was transformed into wild-type cells, but this time recipient cells were selected under conditions that induce pGAL7 ( Figure 3 B). The 5mC pattern of the strain under these inducing conditions (I 0 ) is indistinguishable from that of wild-type indicating that the inducible, tagged allele is functional. Subsequently, upon repression of pGAL - DMT5 , 5mC was lost. However, again, re-induction of Dnmt5 for 40 (I 40 ) or 90 generations (I 90 ) did not restore detectable 5mC. To determine whether 5mC could be restored if it was only partially depleted from cells, for example by a nucleation-spread mechanism, we set up a time course experiment in which we repressed pGAL-DMT5 for limited number of generations ( R ) and re-induced ( I ) it. In repressing conditions, substantial decrease of 5mC signal was observed only after 25 generations, which correlated with the depletion of the mRNA produced by the p GAL-DMT5 overexpression construct ( Figure S4 A). However, upon transfer to galactose-containing inducing medium, we did not observe restoration of 5mC ( Figure 3 C; corresponding quantification shown in Figure 3 D).
We performed an analogous analysis using a different approach. We first deleted a portion of the DMT5 gene followed by the re-introduction of the missing DNA sequence ( Figure 4 ; the re-introduced allele is termed RI-DMT5 ; see STAR Methods ). Although the expression of RI-DMT5 was comparable to that of a wild-type allele, we were not able to detect 5mC by Southern hybridization ( Figure 4 A). WGBS sequencing of the dmt5 Δ strain revealed no methylation on any CG sites genome-wide ( Figure 4 B). Analysis of two independently derived RI-DMT5 strains revealed that methylation is also globally absent save for two sites detected in each strain ( Figures 4 B and S4 B). To examine methylation using an independent global method, we employed attomole-sensitivity mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to measure 5mC. Analysis of 5mC levels present in gDNA extracted from wild-type, dmt5 Δ, and RI-DMT5 revealed 0.33% 5mC (5mC/dG) in wild-type, none detectable in DNA extracted from the dmt5 Δ strain, and trace amounts (detectable but below quantification limits) in DNA extracted from the RI-DMT5 strain ( Figure 4 C). This trace activity suggests that Dnmt5 may able to act at a very low level on unmodified DNA, an event that would be then “remembered” by its maintenance activity. Investigations of methylation dynamics in wild-type cells are described further below.
We observed that H3K9me is still globally maintained in both the dmt5 Δ strain as well as in the RI-DMT5 strain, although the distribution is altered compared to wild-type depending on the genomic region with an increase of the signal at subtelomeric regions ( Figures 4 D and S4 C). Furthermore, ChIP-seq experiments demonstrate that the RI-Dnmt5 protein still localizes to heterochromatic regions ( Figures 4 E and S4 D).
To test explicitly if RI-DMT5 is capable of efficiently maintaining DNA methylation, a wild-type strain whose centromere 13 was marked with a linked drug resistance marker ( CEN13::natR ) and crossed to the RI - DMT5 ( Figure 4 F). From the cross, meiotic progeny bearing the RI-DMT5 allele and the marked centromere were selected. 5mC was assayed by Southern hybridization using a probe specific for CEN13 . All progeny tested displayed a wild-type 5mC pattern ( Figure 4 F), indicating that the RI-DMT5 allele is functional when provided with a methylated substrate.
In many species, sexual reproduction is required for the establishment of 5mC by one or more de novo enzymes. It has been reported that a tandemly repeated URA5 -marked transgene can be heritably silenced after mating and meiosis/sporulation in C. neoformans , but this silencing occurs via RNAi and not via DNA methylation ( Wang et al., 2010 60. Wang, X. ∙ Hsueh, Y.-P. ∙ Li, W. ... Sex-induced silencing defends the genome of Cryptococcus neoformans via RNAi Genes Dev. 2010; 24 :2566-2582 Crossref Scopus (122) PubMed Google Scholar ). Nonetheless, to determine whether an unmethylated centromere can be methylated during sexual reproduction, we performed two genetic crosses and analyzed the meiotic progeny. In a control cross, we crossed a CEN13::natR strain with a dmt5 Δ strain and analyzed three progeny that contained both the marked CEN13 and wild-type DMT5 allele by Southern hybridization using a probe specific for CEN13 . As expected, 5mC was maintained at the methylated centromere ( Figure 4 G). In the experimental cross, we crossed a wild-type strain to one harboring a dmt5 Δ allele that also carries CEN13::natR. We again analyzed three progeny that express the wild-type DMT5 gene and the marked centromere, which entered the cross in an unmethylated state. We observed that such progeny remained unmethylated, indicating that Dnmt5 is able to maintain methylated DNA but does not re-establish on a centromere that had completely lost methylation ( Figure 4 H). Thus, sexual reproduction does not lead to the efficient restoration of 5mC. Finally, we examined cells exposed to several stress conditions to determine whether they could reestablish methylation in the RI-DMT5 strain, and we did not observe restoration of methylation ( Figure S5 A). To test whether there was a restoration of fitness, we sought a facile plate phenotype for dmt5 Δ cells. Hypomethylation of centromeric regions is associated with chromosome instability in ICF syndrome patients harboring mutations in the de novo methylase Dnmt3B ( Hansen et al., 1999; Okano et al., 1999 22. Hansen, R.S. ∙ Wijmenga, C. ∙ Luo, P. ... The DNMT3B DNA methyltransferase gene is mutated in the ICF immunodeficiency syndrome Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96 :14412-14417 Crossref Scopus (626) PubMed Google Scholar 46. Okano, M. ∙ Bell, D.W. ∙ Haber, D.A. ... DNA methyltransferases Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b are essential for de novo methylation and mammalian development Cell. 1999; 99 :247-257 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (4822) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, we tested our strains for sensitivity to the microtubule-depolymerizing drug thiabendazole (TBZ), a phenotype of chromosome instability mutants. Indeed, both dmt5 Δ and RI-DMT5 strains are TBZ-sensitive, indicating a role for 5mC in cellular fitness ( Figure S5 B).
To assess whether Dnmt5 is able to maintain DNA methylation independently on non-endogenous sequences, we methylated in vitro a targeting construct containing a DNA fragment rich in HpaII sites with the HpaII methyltransferase (that produces symmetric CmCGG) and integrated it into the C. neoformans genome at the right border of centromere 4 in order to place it in proximity to H3K9me-modified chromatin ( Figures 5 A–5C). DNA from the transformants was digested with the 5mC-sensitive HpaII restriction endonuclease, and qPCR was performed using a primer pair that spanned the cleavage sites to measure the fraction of a particular site that was methylated ( Figure 5 D). Analysis across seven different HpaII sites revealed that all were maintained in vivo ( Figure 5 D). Thus, there appear to be no obligate sequence requirements beyond CG dinucleotides for methylation to be maintained in vivo , a finding consistent with our biochemical results.
We tested next whether 5mC could spread in vivo by using the in vitro methylated sites as nucleation sites. We digested the genomic DNA with the 5mC-sensitive enzymes BstUI (CGCG) and Hpy99I (CGWCG) and performed qPCR across these sites. We did not observe a signal above background, indicating no detectable spread of 5mC to these nearby CG dinucleotides ( Figure 5 E). We obtained similar results in vitro : we incubated purified Dnmt5 with a dsDNA substrate containing either no CG sites, or two unmethylated CG sites, or two ummethylated CG sites accompanied by a symmetrically methylated CG site ( Figure 5 F). Although methylation products were detected upon incubation with a control bacterial DMT M.SssI, no signal was detected upon incubation with Dnmt5, indicating that the enzyme does not display detectable de novo activity even when presented with a nearby methylated site ( Figure 5 F).
Given that Dnmt5 is the sole DNMT predicted by the C. neoformans genome, and seems to behave as a maintenance DNMT, how was 5mC established? To approach this question, we examined the genomes in the family of organisms to which Cryptococcus neoformans belongs, the Tremellaceae ( Figure 6 , Findley et al., 2009; Guerreiro et al., 2013 17. Findley, K. ∙ Rodriguez-Carres, M. ∙ Metin, B. ... Phylogeny and Phenotypic Characterization of Pathogenic Cryptococcus Species and Closely Related Saprobic Taxa in the Tremellales Eukaryotic cell. 2009; 8 :353-361 Crossref Scopus (81) PubMed Google Scholar 19. Guerreiro, M.A. ∙ Springer, D.J. ∙ Rodrigues, J.A. ... Molecular and Genetic Evidence for a Tetrapolar Mating System in the Basidiomycetous Yeast Kwoniella mangrovensis and Two Novel Sibling Species Eukaryotic Cell. 2013; 12 :746-760 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ). The genomes of species closely related to C. neoformans , including the human pathogen Cryptococcus gattii and the nonpathogens Cryptococcus amylolentus and Cryptococcus wingfieldii , harbor a single predicted DNA methyltransferase, which is orthologous to Dnmt5 ( Figure 6 A). The exception is C. deuterogattii , which has inactivated all transposons and lost both RNAi and 5mC ( Yadav et al., 2018a 64. Yadav, V. ∙ Sun, S. ∙ Billmyre, R.B. ... RNAi is a critical determinant of centromere evolution in closely related fungi Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115 :3108-3113 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar ). The next closest species, Cryptococcus depauperatus , lacks predicted DNA methyltransferases, also indicating loss of DMT5 during its evolution ( Figure 6 A). Strikingly, more distant species encode both Dnmt5 and an uncharacterized predicted DNA methyltransferase, which we term DnmtX (genetic locus: DMX1 ; Figure 6 A). This predicted protein contains a bromo-associated homology (BAH) domain and a Dnmt catalytic domain. This phylogenetic pattern indicates that the DMX1 gene was lost in the common ancestor to C. neoformans and C. depauperatus , and C. depauperatus subsequently lost the DMT5 gene. Given the fact that Dnmt5 is a maintenance methylase, we hypothesized that DnmtX is a de novo methyltransferase.
To test this hypothesis, we cloned the genes for DnmtX from Kwoniella mangroviensis , Kwoniella bestiolae , and Kwoniella pini . Each of these was placed under the control of the pGAL7 galactose-inducible promoter, tagged at the N terminus with a hemagglutinin epitope tag, and then introduced as a transgene into a C. neoformans strain in which the gene for Dnmt5 was disrupted and then restored with a FLAG-tagged allele ( RI-DMT 5). We chose this approach because we predicted that establishment of 5mC by a DnmtX enzyme might be inefficient, especially if cofactors important for de novo methylation were not also introduced.
We induced expression of DnmtX in each strain using medium containing galactose ( Figure S5 C) and then extracted DNA. The levels of 5mC were assessed genome-wide by two technically orthogonal methods, methylated DNA immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (MeDIP-seq) and WGBS. In both assays, we observed the broad accumulation of 5mC in each of the three strains, primarily at centromeric regions ( Figures 6 B and S6 ). These data indicate that all three DnmtXs act as de novo methylases in vivo , providing strong evidence that the ancestral DnmtX also had this function.
The loss of the ancestral DnmtX gene occurred prior to the divergence of C. neoformans and C. depauperatus , but after the divergence of Tremella mesenterica and Kwoniella heveanensis ( Figure 6 A). The divergence time for C. neoformans and C. gattii is estimated to be between 34 and 49 mya ( D’Souza et al., 2011; Ngamskulrungroj et al., 2009 12. D’Souza, C.A. ∙ Kronstad, J.W. ∙ Taylor, G. ... Genome variation in Cryptococcus gattii, an emerging pathogen of immunocompetent hosts mBio. 2011; 2 e00342-10 PubMed Google Scholar 45. Ngamskulrungroj, P. ∙ Gilgado, F. ∙ Faganello, J. ... Genetic Diversity of the Cryptococcus Species Complex Suggests that Cryptococcus gattii Deserves to Have Varieties PLoS One. 2009; 4 :e5862 Crossref Scopus (146) PubMed Google Scholar ). Given the phylogenetic relationships, the divergence time of C. neoformans and C. depauperatus would be considerably more ancient. It has been estimated that the common ancestor of C. neoformans and T. mesenterica lived 153 mya ( Floudas et al., 2012 18. Floudas, D. ∙ Binder, M. ∙ Riley, R. ... The Paleozoic origin of enzymatic lignin decomposition reconstructed from 31 fungal genomes Science. 2012; 336 :1715-1719 Crossref Scopus (1302) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, the DMX1 gene was likely to have been lost between roughly 150 and 50 mya. Taken together, these data indicate that 5mC has been maintained by Dnmt5 over a remarkably long period of time in the population that gave rise to the pathogenic Cryptococcus species complex.
To begin to understand how 5mC has persisted since the ancient loss of DnmtX, we performed an experimental evolution experiment in C. neoformans . A single colony from wild-type cells (generation 0, or g0) was grown in liquid rich media for 120 generations without bottlenecking the population. Dilutions of the final culture were plated to form single colonies on agar plates. Two independent clones were selected, and replicate WGBS analysis was performed on their genomic DNA as well as DNA extracted from a portion of the parental strain ( Figure 6 C). We detected 50 and 38 loss events, respectively, ( Figures 6 D and 6E), indicating that 99.0% and 99.2% of 5mC sites were maintained after 120 generations. Only two sites were lost in both colonies, an overlap expected by chance ( Figure 6 E; Table S1 ). Assuming all sites are equally maintained and assuming first order kinetics, this would correspond to a per-generation loss rate of 9.3 × 10 −5 for each 5mC site. Consistent with the reintroduction experiments described above, we observed five gain events in each experiment (nonoverlapping; Figure 6 E; Table S1 ). Given the number of unmethylated sites, this corresponds to a per-generation gain rate of 4.5 × 10 −6 . Because the gain events occur at a rate that is ∼20-fold below that of the loss events, the system is not at equilibrium under laboratory conditions. Supporting this conclusion, Wald binomial analysis of the experimental evolution data yielded a 95% confidence interval for the value of (methylation gains/gains + losses) of (0.0424, 0.1657) that allows us to confidently reject a model with a higher gain rate because the upper bound corresponds to only ∼17% of events being gains. Thus, selection on methylation levels (across centromeres or specific regions) likely operates in natural populations to maintain the steady state of methylation (see Discussion ).
To investigate further the inheritance of 5mC patterns, we examined its evolutionary conservation. To accomplish this, we first sought to align centromeric regions from isolates that had diverged by a significant period of time. C. neoformans var . grubii , the species of the reference H99 strain, has four well-characterized clades, VNI, VNII, VNBI, and VNBII, which shared a common ancestor ∼4.7 mya ( Ngamskulrungroj et al., 2009 45. Ngamskulrungroj, P. ∙ Gilgado, F. ∙ Faganello, J. ... Genetic Diversity of the Cryptococcus Species Complex Suggests that Cryptococcus gattii Deserves to Have Varieties PLoS One. 2009; 4 :e5862 Crossref Scopus (146) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 7 A). Short-read sequences are available for several hundred strains ( Desjardins et al., 2017 13. Desjardins, C.A. ∙ Giamberardino, C. ∙ Sykes, S.M. ... Population genomics and the evolution of virulence in the fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans Genome Res. 2017; 27 :1207-1219 Crossref Scopus (103) PubMed Google Scholar ), however, centromeric regions, where the bulk of 5mC resides, are not assembled as they contain repetitive sequences, including six families of gypsy and copia retrotransposons, Tcn1–Tcn6 ( Janbon et al., 2014 28. Janbon, G. ∙ Ormerod, K.L. ∙ Paulet, D. ... Analysis of the genome and transcriptome of Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii reveals complex RNA expression and microevolution leading to virulence attenuation PLoS Genet. 2014; 10 :e1004261 Crossref Scopus (286) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, we used long read Oxford nanopore (ONT) sequencing to assemble near-complete genomes of two isolates from each of the four clades ( Figure 7 B). Dot plot analysis of centromeres revealed widespread relative rearrangements of sequence (insertions, deletion, inversions), precluding end-to-end multiple sequence alignment ( Figure S7 A). We instead adopted a local alignment approach to obtain a series of pairwise alignments between segments of centromeres of the eight assembled genomes. On average, 88.5% of centromeric sequence from a given strain could be aligned to the homologous centromere of at least one other strain, with a median alignment length of 607 bp ( Figures S7 B and S7C). We performed replicate WGBS analysis on each strain and overlaid these data onto the alignments. An example of this analysis is shown in Figure 7 C, which displays the 5mC status of CG sites that can be aligned between a centromere of an arbitrarily chosen strain (A1_35_8) and the homologous centromere on other seven strains. Next, for each centromeric CG dinucleotide in each of the strains, we determined the number of strains (N) to which a given CG nucleotide could be identified by alignment and then calculated the fraction of CGs that were methylated in all N strains ( Figure 7 D). Statistical analysis revealed a significant excess of sharing of methylated sites compared to the null model, regardless of the strain used as a reference and the number of strains to which a centromeric CG dinucleotide could be aligned (see STAR Methods ).
Given the concomitant loss of 5mC and intact transposons in C. deuterogattii , it seems likely that important targets of DNA methylation are the Tcn elements described above. We tested whether these elements display higher levels of 5mC than non-Tcn centromeric sequences and whether these patterns are conserved. In all eight strains, we identified sequences at centromeres that are highly homologous to Tcn1–Tcn6, including a fraction harboring two LTRs, which are candidates for active transposons ( Figure S7 D). Due to their length and repetitiveness, Tcn elements are not well-covered by WGBS; hence we supplemented the WGBS data using methylation calls from ONT long-read data, which we found to be highly correlated with those produced by WGBS ( Figures S7 E and S7F). Consistent with selection acting on 5mC in Tcn elements, we observed a significantly higher fraction of methylated CGs on Tcn-related sequences than non-Tcn sequences within centromeres ( Figure 7 E).
Because Tcn3-related sequences displayed the longest median length and the most LTR-flanked elements ( Figure S7 D), we performed additional analysis on these elements. We aligned each CG dinucleotide from the longest (top quartile) Tcn3-related sequences and overlaid the 5mC data. Strikingly, for the vast majority of CG dinucleotides aligned ( Figure 7 F, vertical columns), we observed high sharing of methylation (mean fraction = 0.7, p < 10 −16 ) compared to a control model for Tcn3 of independently permutated 5mC sites (mean fraction = 0.4149) indicating sharing of 5mC patterns across strains above expectation. Note that in several cases we observed similar patterns of 5mC on different Tcn3 elements within a single strain ( Figure 7 F); this is more likely the result of recombination events such as unequal crossing over rather than retrotransposition as the latter would be expected to erase methylation patterns. The small number of Tcn3s that have little methylation may have undergone retrotransposition at some point that would have erased 5mC; alternatively these could be inactive elements upon which selection is no longer operative.

Section: Discussion

A fungal de novo -maintenance pair has not been functionally or biochemically identified. Our studies identified one-half of this pair, Dnmt5, in the human pathogenic yeast C. neoformans . To our surprise, Dnmt5 is a maintenance enzyme in vitro with extraordinarily high specificity for hemimethylated substrates. Dnmt5 is not closely related to the conserved Dnmt1 maintenance methylase, and unlike Dnmt1, Dnmt5 requires ATP for activity and displays considerably higher specificity for hemimethylated DNA than Dnmt1 ( Bashtrykov et al., 2014 2. Bashtrykov, P. ∙ Jankevicius, G. ∙ Jurkowska, R.Z. ... The UHRF1 protein stimulates the activity and specificity of the maintenance DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 by an allosteric mechanism J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289 :4106-4115 Crossref Scopus (100) PubMed Google Scholar ). Nonetheless, the chromatin signals that promote maintenance methylation in C. neoformans are shared with mammals and plants.
Given that Dnmt5 is a highly specific maintenance enzyme in vitro , it is unexpected that Dnmt5 is the only predicted cytosine methylase encoded by the C. neoformans genome. One possibility would be that Dnmt5 acts differently in vivo . However, we observed that methylation loss after depleting cells of Dnmt5 was not restored upon re-introduction of the enzyme. This was true even if Dnmt5 was introduced through a genetic cross. Tandem repeats are silenced in C. neoformans during sexual reproduction in a process called sex-induced silencing (SIS) ( Wang et al., 2010 60. Wang, X. ∙ Hsueh, Y.-P. ∙ Li, W. ... Sex-induced silencing defends the genome of Cryptococcus neoformans via RNAi Genes Dev. 2010; 24 :2566-2582 Crossref Scopus (122) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, SIS is an unstable RNAi-based phenomenon that does not result in methylation of repeats ( Wang et al., 2010 60. Wang, X. ∙ Hsueh, Y.-P. ∙ Li, W. ... Sex-induced silencing defends the genome of Cryptococcus neoformans via RNAi Genes Dev. 2010; 24 :2566-2582 Crossref Scopus (122) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, it appears that there is no efficient de novo methylation mechanism in this organism. Consistent with these observations, we determined that the ancestor of the pathogenic Cryptococcus species complex harbored a second DNMT homolog. Our functional experiments demonstrate that extant DnmtX from three different species are each capable of triggering widespread DNA methylation de novo in C. neoformans , indicating that DnmtX is a de novo enzyme. Thus, we conclude that 5mC has endured in C. neoformans for millions of years through the action of Dnmt5.
Although we did not observed restoration of 5mC globally when Dnmt5 was removed and re-introduced, we did observe two apparent de novo events in two independent experiments. A caveat of this experiment is that cells that lack methylation to begin with would not be able to recruit Uhrf1 efficiently and thus may not well represent wild-type. Thus, we performed an experimental evolution experiment in wild-type cells. This work revealed preservation of 5mC patterns with high fidelity. We observed loss events, which occurred at a low rate, and gain events, which occurred at a considerably lower rate. The gain events may be produced by the action of Dnmt5 on unmethylated DNA, the activity of some other cellular methylase or gene conversion events that produce hemimethylated heteroduplex DNA that would then be a favored substrate for Dnmt5. The latter is plausible as the nonreciprocal transfer of 5mC has been observed during meiosis in A. immersus ( Colot et al., 1996 11. Colot, V. ∙ Maloisel, L. ∙ Rossignol, J.L. Interchromosomal transfer of epigenetic states in Ascobolus: transfer of DNA methylation is mechanistically related to homologous recombination Cell. 1996; 86 :855-864 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (99) PubMed Google Scholar ). Regardless of their source, these gain events, which seem to be rare and randomly distributed, provide a mechanism to inject new sites of methylation.
Because the rate of methylation loss is ∼20-fold higher than that of gain, we infer that the system is not at equilibrium. Our estimate of the loss rate for 5mC at a given site (∼9.3 × 10 −5 /generation) implies a half-life of methylation at a given site to be ∼7,500 generations. Even if we assume that C. neoformans divides 100-fold more slowly in the wild than in the laboratory, this would correspond to half-life of only ∼130 years. Our analysis of eight isolates of C. neoformans var . grubii that span the four major clades of this pathogen and diverged ∼5 mya ( Figure 7 ), demonstrate significant sharing of 5mC sites across centromeres and across annotated dual LTR-harboring Tcn3 elements. Given the half-lives of methylated CG sites predicted by the laboratory evolution experiments, the observed sharing of patterns over million-year timescales cannot not be explained by shared ancestry without selection (i.e., identity-by-descent).
Instead, we propose that natural selection maintains methylation to higher levels than would be expected from a neutral loss-gain process. Supporting this model, our analysis of C. neoformans var . grubii epigenomes demonstrated higher fraction of methylated CGs (median = 0.59) in dual LTR-harboring centromeric retrotransposon (Tcn) sequences than in non-transposon centromeric sequences (median = 0.24). A simple population genetics model of the evolution of codon bias can be adapted to estimate the expected fractions with and without selection (modified from Hershberg and Petrov, 2008 25. Hershberg, R. ∙ Petrov, D.A. Selection on codon bias Annu. Rev. Genet. 2008; 42 :287-299 Crossref Scopus (730) PubMed Google Scholar ), 𝑃 ⁡ ( 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ ℎ ⁢ 𝑦 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑑 ) = 1 1 + ( 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑠 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑔 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 ) ∗ 𝑒 − 2 ⁢ 𝑁 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑠 , where P (methylated) is the fraction of sites that display the methylated state, μ gain and μ loss are the rates of epimutation from unmethylated and methylated states to the opposite states, respectively, N e is the effective population size, and s is the selection coefficient for the methylated state. Based on the observed rates of methylation loss and gain, the null model ( s = 0) would predict an equilibrium fraction of methylated CGs of 0.047. This is much lower than the observed fraction for Tcn elements (0.59), consistent with a role for purifying selection. This calculation assumes that the relative rates of methylation loss and gain measured in the laboratory generally reflect those of wild populations and that this ratio is not dramatically different across different centromeric intervals. We note that non-Tcn CG sequences of the centromeres have a higher fraction of methylation than predicted by a neutral model, which may reflect a role for CG methylation in centromere function as inferred from the TBZ sensitivity of cells lacking 5mC. Together, our experimental and observational evolutionary studies support with a model in which 5mC is inherited with high fidelity and that 5mC loss and gain events in C. neoformans act in a manner akin to mutation in DNA sequence by producing random variation upon which natural selection acts. As with the evolution of codon bias, selection is likely to be weak with no requirement that any specific CG site be in the methylated state.
We did not observe sequence specificity beyond CG dinucleotides for 5mC occurrence in C. neoformans : an alignment of methylated sites across the eight genomes described in Figure 7 reveals only a CG motif ( Figure S7 G). Consistent with this finding, we found that introduced in vitro methylated DNA of bacterial origin is well-maintained by Dnmt5 in vivo , and purified Dnmt5 methylates artificial DNA sequences in vitro harboring hemimethylated CG dinucleotides. These findings argue that sharing of methylation sites across phylogeny we observe is not explained by a detectable requirement by Dnmt5 for particular sequences beyond hemimethylated CG dinucleotides.
As Dnmt5 orthologs are widespread in the fungal and protist kingdoms, we speculate that the unique properties this enzyme endow organisms that harbor it to also undergo epigenome evolution over long timescales. We anticipate that the availability of a tractable haploid yeast system for investigating a highly specific maintenance cytosine methylation system will continue to provide insights into the mechanistic underpinnings and biological roles of epigenetic memory.

Tagging, deletions and insertions of genes were obtained through homologous recombination by transforming about 10 μg of either a PCR product or a PmeI-digested plasmids bearing the sequence to be transformed. Mutations of Dnmt5 on its catalytic methyltransferase domain (C440A) and ATP-ase domain (K1469A) were created based on prior work ( Pause and Sonenberg, 1992; Wyszynski et al., 1992 48.

The RI-DMT5 strain used for WGBS was produced by deleting the 5′ portion of the DMT5 gene and then restoring it by homologous replacement. To be certain that no residual DNA methylation was present in dmt5Δ prior to introduction of the targeting construct that restores the gene, the dmt5Δ strain was first propagated in YPAD for at least 90 generations.
To express DnmtX in an RI-DMT5 strain, genomic DNA from K. pini, K. mangroviensis and K. bestiolae was used as a template to amplify the genes putative DnmtXs ( K. mangroviensis I203_05465, K. pini I302_00877, K. bestiolae I206_02865). DnmtX was cloned downstream a GAL7 promoter and the entire construct was then inserted at the URA5 locus. Upon transformation, cells were selected in YPAD+nourseothrycin and then propagated for two sequential single-colony streaks in presence of galactose to induce DnmtX.
Other strains generated by transformation were colony-purified, patched, verified, and frozen. Liquid cultures were inoculated directly from the frozen stock. A list of strains used in this study can be found on Table S2 .
Crosses were carried out using strains of the KN99 background. Cells of different mating types were grown overnight in YPAD, spotted on mating plates (4% Agar, 10% 10X Murashige and Skoog basal medium, 0.1mg/ml myo-inositol) and kept in the dark for 1 to 2 weeks. Spores were collected with a toothpick and resuspended in 500 μl of water. Dilutions of this suspension were then spread on selective media.
DNA from C. neoformans, K. pinus, K. mangroviensis and K. bestiolae was extracted as previously described ( Chun and Madhani, 2010 10. Chun, C.D. ∙ Madhani, H.D. Applying genetics and molecular biology to the study of the human pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans Methods Enzymol. 2010; 470 :797-831 Crossref Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ) with some modifications. In brief, 100 OD of yeast (100 ml, OD1) were harvested, frozen in liquid nitrogen, resuspended in 5 mL CTAB buffer (100 mM Tris pH 7.6, 1M NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 1% Cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide, 1% β-mercaptoethanol) and incubated at 65°C for at least 1 hr. 3 mL of chloroform were added to the lysate, mixed and spun for 5 min at 3000 g. The aqueous phase was then precipitated by adding the same volume of isopropanol. The dried pellet was resuspended in 300 μl TE containing 1 μg RNase A (Thermo Scientific) and incubated 30 min at 37°C followed by addition of 3 μl Proteinase K (20 mg/ml) and incubation at 50°C for 1 hr. Phenol-chloroform and chloroform extraction was carried out and the DNA is finally precipitated by addition of 1/10 volume NaOAc and three volumes of ethanol. The DNA was additionally purified with Genomic DNA Clean & Concentrator (D4065, Zymo Research). For Southern analysis, 10 μg were then digested with the meCpG sensitive enzyme HpyCH4IV (NEB), separated by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel and transferred to nylon membrane (Hybond NX, Amersham) by capillary action. DNA was crosslinked to the membrane using UV light. PCR products were used as template to incorporate radioactive 32 P-dCTP (Perkin Elmer) using the High Prime kit (Roche) according to manufacturer’s protocol. Primer sequences for the probes are listed in Table S3 .
To assess if specific stress conditions induce de novo DNA methylation activity, wild-type and RI-Dnmt5 cells were grown in the presence of stressors. 2.3 M NaCl at 30°C for 3 hr, 140 mM/ 2.3mM NaNO 2 /succinic acid at 30°C for 3 hr, 0.14% H 2 O 2 at 30°C for 3 hr, 0.9% SDS at 30°C for 3 hr, 1.9 mg/ml caffeine at 37°C for 20 hr, DMEM at 37°C, 5% CO 2 , for 24 hr. The concentrations of stressors used represent the maximum concentration that allows growth in the conditions tested.
Two milliliters of culture at OD600 = 1 were collected by centrifugation and frozen in liquid nitrogen, resuspended in 10% TCA and incubated on ice for 10 min. Cells were washed once with acetone and air-dried for 10 min. The pellet was then resuspended in 150 μl 2x Laemmli buffer adjusted with 80 μl Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and bead-beated 2 × 90 s. The lysate was boiled for 5min and centrifuged to remove residual cells. Western analysis was performed using anti-FLAG antibody (1:3000- F3165, sigma), anti-HA (1:10000-26183, Thermo Fisher) or anti-H3 antibody (1:1000- PA5-16183, Thermo Fisher) diluted with 5% milk in TBS-T (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 hr followed by 2 × 10 min washes in TBS-T. The membrane was then incubated with antibody anti-rabbit or anti-mouse conjugated to HRP (BIO-RAD) (1:8000 in 5% milk+TBS-T) for 45 min followed by 2 × 10 min washes in TBS-T. The membrane was then incubated in SuperSignal West pico luminol (Thermo Scientific) and visualized using film.
Dynabeads M-270 Epoxy (Cat n. 14301) were conjugated following the manual with the following modifications. 150 μg anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma-F3165) was conjugated with 1x10 9 beads overnight at 37°C. The beads were washed once with 100 mM Glycine HCL pH 2.5, once with 10 mM Tris pH 8.8, 4x with 1x PBS for 5 min, once with PBS + 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min, once PBS +0.5% Triton X-100 for 15 min. Beads were the resuspended in the PBS and kept at 4°C before using them.
4 L of C. neoformans cells were grown on YPAD at 30°C until OD = 2, harvested, resuspended in 10 mL Lysis buffer (25 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 2 mM MgCl 2 , 100 mM KCl, 16% glycerol, 0.1% Tween 20) and dripped into liquid nitrogen to form ‘popcorn.’ Cell were lysed by cryo-grinding in a SPEX Sample Prep 6870 instrument for 3 cycles of 2 min at 10 cps with 2 min of cooling between each cycle. The extract was then thawed at 4°C, the final volume was brought to 80 mL with Lysis Buffer+2 mM CaCl 2 and incubated with 1000U of RQ1 DNase (Promega- PRM6101) for 30min at RT. At this point, the extract was clarified by centrifugation at 40Kxg for 40 min at 4°C and FLAG-conjugated magnetic beads were added to the supernatant and incubated for 4h at 4°C with rotation. The beads were then washed 3x10 min with lysis buffer and using a magnetic rack. Bound proteins were eluted three times in 150 μl elution buffer (25 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 2 mM MgCl 2 , 300 mM KCl, 20% glycerol) with 1 mg/ml 3X FLAG peptide (Sigma). For the co-immunoprecipitation experiments, 1 L culture was used in the assay and the final elution step was performed by boiling the beads with 2x Laemmli buffer for 10 min.
Label free mass spectrometry was performed as follows. Samples were precipitated by methanol/ chloroform. Dried pellets were dissolved in 8 M urea/100 mM TEAB, pH 8.5. Proteins were reduced with 5 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP, Sigma-Aldrich) and alkylated with 10 mM chloroacetamide (Sigma-Aldrich). Proteins were digested overnight at 37°C in 2 M urea/100 mM TEAB, pH 8.5, with trypsin (Promega). Digestion was quenched with formic acid, 5% final concentration.
The digested samples were analyzed on a Fusion Orbitrap tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermo). The digest was injected directly onto a 25 cm, 100 μm ID column packed with BEH 1.7 μm C18 resin (Waters). Samples were separated at a flow rate of 300 nl/min on a nLC 1000 (Thermo). Buffer A and B were 0.1% formic acid in water and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile, respectively. A gradient of 1%–25% B over 110 min, an increase to 40% B over 10 min, an increase to 90% B over 10 mins and held at 90%B for a final 10 min was used for 140 min total run time. Column was re-equilibrated with 20 μl of buffer A prior to the injection of sample. Peptides were eluted directly from the tip of the column and nanosprayed directly into the mass spectrometer by application of 2.5 kV voltage at the back of the column. The Orbitrap Fusion was operated in a data dependent mode. Full MS scans were collected in the Orbitrap at 120K resolution with a mass range of 400 to 1500 m/z and an AGC target of 4e 5 . The cycle time was set to 3 s, and within this 3 s the most abundant ions per scan were selected for CID MS/MS in the ion trap with an AGC target of 5e 4 and minimum intensity of 5000. Maximum fill times were set to 50 ms and 100 ms for MS and MS/MS scans respectively. Quadrupole isolation at 1.6 m/z was used, monoisotopic precursor selection was enabled and dynamic exclusion was used with exclusion duration of 5 s.
Bisulfite library construction was performed as previously described ( Urich et al., 2015 57. Urich, M.A. ∙ Nery, J.R. ∙ Lister, R. ... MethylC-seq library preparation for base-resolution whole-genome bisulfite sequencing Nat. Protoc. 2015; 10 :475-483 Crossref Scopus (197) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, 100 OD units of yeast were harvested, lyophilised overnight and the DNA was extracted using DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (QIAGEN). The DNA was additionally purified with a Genomic DNA Clean & Concentrator (D4065- Zymo Research). Genomic DNA was quantified with Qubit dsDNA BR Assay Kit (ThermoFisher). 5 ng of lambda DNA (Promega) was added to ∼1 ug yeast DNA and fragmented using a Bioruptor Pico instrument (Diagenode- 13 cycles, 30 s/ 30 s On/Off). The DNA was end-repaired and ligated to methylated adapters. Two rounds of bisulfite conversion of the adaptor-ligated DNA were performed using EZ-DNA methylation Gold Kit (D5005- Zymo Research), and used as template for three separate PCR reactions (eight cycles of amplification) as described in Urich et al. (2015) 57. Urich, M.A. ∙ Nery, J.R. ∙ Lister, R. ... MethylC-seq library preparation for base-resolution whole-genome bisulfite sequencing Nat. Protoc. 2015; 10 :475-483 Crossref Scopus (197) PubMed Google Scholar . DNA obtained from the three PCR reactions were then combined and analyzed for size on a High Sensitivity DNA chip (Agilent Technologies) and sequenced as SE100.
ChIP and library preparation were performed as previously described ( Homer et al., 2016 26. Homer, C.M. ∙ Summers, D.K. ∙ Goranov, A.I. ... Intracellular Action of a Secreted Peptide Required for Fungal Virulence Cell Host Microbe. 2016; 19 :849-864 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ) with the following modifications. 50 OD were lysed in ChIP lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.5, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 1mM PMSF and 1x protease inhibitors) using a bead beater (8 cycles x 90 s) and lysate was clarified by centrifugation 10 min at 6800 g. The chromatin pellet was sonicated in a Bioruptor Pico instrument (Diagenode; 25 cycles, 30 s/ 30sec on/off) and centrifuged for 20 min at 20000 g. The cleared lysate was incubated overnight with 6 μg anti-histone H3K9me2 (ab1220, Abcam), 4 μl anti-FLAG antibodies (F3165, sigma) or 3 μl anti-H3 (ab1791, Abcam) with the addition of 30 μl of protein A (for anti-H3K9me) or protein G (for anti-FLAG, anti-H3) Dynabeads (Thermo Fisher) overnight at 4°C. Beads were then washed once with ChIP lysis buffer, once with ChIP lysis buffer with 500 mM NaCl, once with wash buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.0, 0.25 M LiCl, 0.5% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA), and once with 1 mL TE buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA). Each wash was performed for 10 min at room temperature. Beads were eluted with 100 μL elution buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA, 1% SDS) at 70°C for 15 min, followed by a second elution at room temperature for 5 min with 150 μL TE buffer with 0.67% SDS and 334 μg/ml proteinase K. 200 μL TE buffer with 1% SDS and 250 μg/ml proteinase K were added to the input samples. All samples were incubated overnight at 65°C. The DNA was purified with NucleoSpin PCR clean-up columns (Macherey-Nagel) using NTB buffer (Macherey-Nagel).
For the ChIP library preparation, the DNA was end repaired with Fast DNA End Repair Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and then A-tailed with Klenow (exo-) (NEB) according to manufacturers’ instructions. Illumina adapters were ligated using Rapid T4 DNA Ligase (QIAGEN Beverly Inc) at room temperature for 30 min. The DNA was purified using NucleoSpin PCR clean-up columns (Macherey-Nagel) between each step of the library preparation. The library was then amplified with 1U Phusion DNA polymerase (NEB), 2 M betaine, 75 μM dNTPs, and 0.4 μM each primer in a 50 μL reaction. Cycling conditions were: 98°C for 3 min; 15 cycles of 98°C for 1 min 20 s, 65°C 30 s, 72°C 30 s; 72°C 5 min.
The initial steps are the same as described for the bisulfite library protocol ( Urich et al., 2015 57. Urich, M.A. ∙ Nery, J.R. ∙ Lister, R. ... MethylC-seq library preparation for base-resolution whole-genome bisulfite sequencing Nat. Protoc. 2015; 10 :475-483 Crossref Scopus (197) PubMed Google Scholar ) with the exception that for MeDIP, unmethylated adapters were ligated to repaired, dA-tailed DNA. Upon ligation and purification, DNA was boiled for 10 min and kept on ice for 5 min. Ice cold binding buffer (10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7, 140 mM NaCl 0.05% Triton X-100) was added to the DNA together with 1 μl of anti-5-methylcytosine antibody (A-1014-050, Epigentek) and incubated on a nutator overnight at 4°C. 20 μl Protein G Dynabeads (Thermo Fisher) were added and incubated on a Nutator for further 2 hr at 4°C. Beads were washed 10 × 5 min in binding buffer and the DNA was eluted by incubating the beads with Elution Buffer (TE, 0.25 mg/ml Proteinase K, 0.25% SDS) for 2 hr at 55°C. The DNA was purified with NucleoSpin PCR clean-up columns (Macherey-Nagel) using NTB buffer (Macherey-Nagel) and PCR amplified as for ChIP. Bioinformatics analyses were performed as for ChIP-seq.
The construct was in vitro methylated with HpaII methyltransferase (NEB), which recognizes the CCGG sequence and modifies the internal cytosine residue. At least 10 μg of the targeting construct were incubated with 20U HpaII methyltransferase for 2 h at 37°C followed by inactivation of the enzyme at 65°C for 20 min. The DNA was then purified with NucleoSpin Gel and PCR Clean-up Columns (Macherey-Nachel, 740609) and the efficiency of the in vitro methylation reaction was assayed by digesting 100 ng of the in vitro methylated product with 1U of the HpaII endonuclease (run: undigested, unmethylated+digestion, methylated+digestion, Figure 5 C). Transformation was carried out with the in vitro methylated or with the unmodified fragment and the transformants were selected in the presence of G418.
To assess the ability of cells to maintain 5mC at the in vitro methylated CCGG sites, we calculated the methylation fraction for specific sites as ratio of qPCR values across the CCGG-site of interest (5mC protects from restriction enzyme digestion) to a region that does not contain the CCGG site. To test the capability of Dnmt5 to promote the spread 5mC, adjacent sites to HpaII sequence were used and in specific CGCG sites (BstUI) or CGWCG sites (Hyp99I). Genomic DNA was prepared as previously described and cleaned up with a Genomic DNA Clean & Concentrator kit (D4065- Zymo Research). 50 ng of genomic DNA was digested with the appropriate restriction endonuclease and purified using Genomic DNA Clean & Concentrator kit (D4065- Zymo Research). 0.6 ng was used as template for qPCR analysis using PowerUp SYBR Green Master Mix (Life Technologies) with primers listed in Table S3 .
Wild-type cells from a starter culture (g0) were propagated at 30°C in rich media for 120 generations maintaining the logarithmic growth by diluting the culture as soon as it reached an OD600 of 1. After 120 generations, the cells were plated on YPAD agar plates to form single colonies at 30°C. Two independent isolates (colony 1 and colony 2) were grown overnight in rich media to OD600 of 1 and the genomic DNA extracted processed in technical duplicates for WGBS. WGBS libraries and analysis were performed as described above.
A codon-optimized DNA sequence encoding C. neoformans Dnmt5 (residues 1-150) was cloned into pETARA or pMAL vectors and used to transform E. coli strain BL21(DE3) ( Harris et al., 2001; Reményi et al., 2005 23.

For expression in S. cerevisiae , full-length cDNA encoding Dnmt5 was cloned from C. neoformans , inserted into the 83ν vector ( Li et al., 2009b 41. Li, M. ∙ Hays, F.A. ∙ Roe-Zurz, Z. ... Selecting optimum eukaryotic integral membrane proteins for structure determination by rapid expression and solubilization screening J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 385 :820-830 Crossref Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ), and used to transform the S. cerevisiae strain JEL1 ( Lindsley and Wang, 1993 42. Lindsley, J.E. ∙ Wang, J.C. On the coupling between ATP usage and DNA transport by yeast DNA topoisomerase II J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268 :8096-8104 Abstract Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). Starter cultures were grown overnight in SC -ura medium (2% glucose), then used to inoculate 2 L cultures of YPGL medium (1x YEP, 1.7% lactic acid, 3% glycerol, 0.12% glucose, 0.15 mM adenine) to a starting OD 600 of 0.03. After growth at 30°C to an OD 600 of 1.0, expression was induced by addition of 2% galactose. After 6 hr of continued growth at 30°C, cells were harvested, washed once in TBS (50 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl), and snap frozen. Frozen cells were lysed in a ball mill (6 × 3 min at 15 Hz), resuspended in Ni-NTA lysis buffer (50 mM NaH 2 PO 4 pH 8, 300 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 10 mM imidazole, 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.02% NP-40, 1x CPI), and centrifuged 20,000 x g for 30 min at 4°C. Lysate was bound to Ni-NTA resin in batch format for 2 hr at 4°C, after which resin was washed in column format with five bed volumes Ni-NTA buffer followed by ten bed volumes Ni-NTA wash buffer (identical to Ni-NTA lysis buffer except 20 mM imidazole). Finally, bound protein was eluted with four bed volumes of elution buffer (identical to Ni-NTA lysis buffer except 300 mM imidazole and no detergent). Protein was dialyzed against storage buffer and applied to a HiTrap Q HP anion exchange column (GE Life sciences) pre-equilibrated in buffer (50 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.9, 150 mM KCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol). Fractions were collected across a 150-1000 mM KCl gradient, and those containing Dnmt5 were pooled, dialyzed against storage buffer, and frozen.
Modified histone peptide arrays (Active Motif) were blocked with 5% dried milk in TBS-T (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) overnight at 4°C. Each slide was subsequently washed in TBS-T (4x5 min) and binding buffer (2 × 5 min). Binding buffer consisted of 50 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.9, 200 mM NaCl. The slide was incubated with 0.5 μM GST-Dnmt5(1-150) in binding buffer for 4 hr at 23°C. It was then washed with TBS-T (4x 5 min). Next, the slide was incubated with anti-GST antibody (Sigma G7781; 1:13,000 dilution) in 5% dried milk in TBS-T for 1hr at 23°C. After washing in TBS-T (4 × 5 min), the slide was incubated with HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (sc-2004, Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:5,000 dilution) in 5% milk in TBS-T for 1hr at 23°C. The slide was washed in TBS-T (4 × 5 min) and visualized using SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) and a ChemiDoc MP System (BioRad). Signal intensity normalization was performed using Array Analyze Software (Active Motif).
Peptides were synthesized by GenScript (Piscataway, NJ) or Peptide 2.0 (Chantilly, VA) to > 95% purity. For study of H3K9 methylation, unlabeled peptides corresponded to residues 1-15 of C. neoformans histone H3. For study of H3K27 methylation, unlabeled peptides corresponded to residues 23-34 of C. neoformans histone H3 followed by a cysteine residue. Peptide concentrations were determined by A 205 or, in the case of fluorescein-conjugated peptides, A 495 (ε = 80,000 M -1 cm -1 ).
For direct measurement of peptide binding, increasing concentrations of MBP-Dnmt5(1-150) were incubated with 10 nM labeled peptide in a solution of 20 mM HEPES pH 7.9, 120 mM KCl, 0.8 mM DTT, and 0.01% NP-40. Peptide fluorescence polarization was measured using a Spectramax M5e plate reader (Molecular Devices) and non-stick 384-well plates (Corning 3820). For competition assays, unlabeled competitor peptides were added at increasing concentration in the setting of 5 μM MBP-Dnmt5(1-150) or 30 μM 6xHis-Swi6 and 10 nM fluorescein-conjugated H3K9me3 peptide. Dissociation constants were calculated using a competition binding equation in Prism (GraphPad Software) ( Pack et al., 2016 47. Pack, L.R. ∙ Yamamoto, K.R. ∙ Fujimori, D.G.

Primer sequences are listed in Table S3 and were annealed to generate unmethylated, hemimethylated, or symmetrically methylated 20 bp dsDNA substrates. The substrates were then radiolabeled using the KinaseMax kit (Ambion) and ATPγ- 32 P (Perkin Elmer), after which they were purified using a G-25 illustra microspin column (GE Life Sciences). For direct measurement of DNA binding, recombinant 6xHis-Uhrf1 was incubated with 0.2 nM labeled DNA probe in a 10 μL solution of 15 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.9, 7.5% glycerol, 75 mM KCl, 0.075% NP-40, 0.05 μg/ul poly-dI:dC (Sigma), 0.5 μg/ul BSA, 1 mM DTT, and 5 mM MgCl 2 . After 30 min equilibration at 23°C, samples were resolved in polyacrylamide gels (4.5% acrylamide:bis 29:1 (Bio-Rad), 1% glycerol, 0.25X TBE) at 4°C. Gels were subsequently dried and imaged using a storage phosphor screen (Amersham) and a Typhoon 9400 imager (Amersham). Densitometry was performed using ImageJ. For competitive binding assays, conditions were as above except Uhrf1 protein was kept constant at 150 nM in the presence of 0.2 nM labeled hemimethylated probe and excess amounts of unlabeled DNA oligonucleotides.
DNA oligonucleotides were synthesized and annealed to generate 20 or 60 bp dsDNA substrates ( Table S3 ). DNA methylation was monitored in multiple turnover conditions by incubating 30 nM Dnmt5 in a solution of 50 mM Tris pH 8, 25 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 2 mM DTT, in the presence of 5 μM DNA substrate. When indicated, ATP and MgCl 2 were supplemented at 1 mM, histone tail peptides corresponding to histone H3 residues 1-15 were added at 5 μM, Uhrf1 was added at 4 μM, and Swi6 was added at 4 μM. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 4 μM 3 H-SAM (Perkin Elmer) and carried out at 23°C. Reaction aliquots were removed at indicated time points and quenched in a solution of 10 mM SAM in 10 mM H 2 SO 4 . The quenched solution was pipetted onto DE81 filter paper and allowed to dry for 10 min. Filter papers were subsequently washed three times in 200 mM ammonium bicarbonate (5 min each), then once with water (5 min). Filter papers were then rinsed twice in ethanol, after which they were dried for 20 min. Filters were added to scintillation fluid (Bio-Safe NA, Research Products International Corp.), and bound 3 H was detected in an LS 6500 scintillation counter (Perkin Elmer). Background signal was assessed using reactions that lacked Dnmt5 enzyme. Detectable signal was defined as reactions that exhibited cpm greater than 2-fold above background at each measured time point. Background signal was typically 50-100 cpm and signal for productive reactions ranged from ∼1000 to ∼100,000 cpm depending on conditions and time point. For reactions in which methylation was detected, rates were calculated over the first 15-20 min where reaction progress was linear and less than 10% of available hemimethylated sites had been acted upon. These initial rate values were divided by Dnmt5 concentration to obtain k obs . DNA substrate was confirmed to be present at saturating concentration for these experiments. Serial dilutions confirmed that 3 H detection using DE81 was linear to the level of background signal.
Genomic DNA was isolated as previously described and purified with Genomic DNA Clean & Concentrator kit (D4065 - Zymo Research). Enzyme mix provided (New England Biolabs) was used to digest the gDNA to nucleosides. Standard nucleosides were diluted in different ratios using LC-MS water. Identical amount of isotope labeled-internal standards (provided by T. Carell) were spiked in the dilutions of standards and in the samples. Chromatographic separation of nucleosides was achieved using an Agilent RRHD Eclipse Plus C18 2.1 × 100 mm 1.8 μm column and the analysis was performed using an Agilent triple quadrupole mass spectrometer, (1290) UHPLC hyphenated to a (6490) QQQ-MS. The LC-MS method used for the quantitation of 5mC was performed as previously described ( Leitch et al., 2013 36. Leitch, H.G. ∙ McEwen, K.R. ∙ Turp, A. ... Naive pluripotency is associated with global DNA hypomethylation Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2013; 20 :311-316 Crossref Scopus (395) PubMed Google Scholar ). A standard curve was generated by dividing unlabeled over isotope-labeled nucleosides and used to covert the peak area values to quantities. The signal-to-noise (S/N) used for quantification (above 10) was calculated using the peak-to-peak method. Global 5mC level is quoted relative to total levels of deoxyguanine (dG). The LOD (level of detection) for 5mC in the experiments was 25 amol and LOQ (limit of quantification) was 250 amol.
Reads were trimmed for adaptor sequence (“GATCGGAAGA”) and filtered for reads of at least 50 nt in length using Cutadapt ( Martin, 2011 44. Martin, M. Cutadapt removes adapter sequences from high-throughput sequencing reads EMBnet.journal. 2011; 17 :10-12 Crossref Google Scholar ) with were aligned to the C. neoformans genome using bowtie1 (modified parameters: -v2, -M1,–best) ( Langmead et al., 2009 34. Langmead, B. ∙ Trapnell, C. ∙ Pop, M. ... Ultrafast and memory-efficient alignment of short DNA sequences to the human genome Genome Biol. 2009; 10 :R25 Crossref Scopus (16508) PubMed Google Scholar ). Alignment files were processed with SAMtools ( Li et al., 2009a 40. Li, H. ∙ Handsaker, B. ∙ Wysoker, A. ..., 1000 Genome Project Data Processing Subgroup The Sequence Alignment/Map format and SAMtools Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :2078-2079 Crossref Scopus (38855) PubMed Google Scholar ) and converted to bedgraph format for visualization with BEDTools ( Quinlan and Hall, 2010 51. Quinlan, A.R. ∙ Hall, I.M. BEDTools: a flexible suite of utilities for comparing genomic features Bioinformatics. 2010; 26 :841-842 Crossref Scopus (15110) PubMed Google Scholar ). Bedgraphs were scaled by million aligned reads and normalized to whole cell extract at each genomic position, then smoothed using a 500 bp centered rolling mean using custom Python scripts.
For scatterplots, reads (were counted in each region (centromere or telomere) using the Pysam Python library ( https://github.com/pysam-developers/pysam ). RPKM was determined by scaling the reads in each region, n, to the total number of aligned reads in the sample, M (in millions), and the length of the region, l (in kb): 𝑅 ⁢ 𝑃 ⁢ 𝐾 ⁢ 𝑀 = 𝑛 𝑀 ∗ 𝑙 Normalized enrichment in ChIP over whole cell extract, E , was calculated based on RPKM as follows: 𝐸 = 𝑅 ⁢ 𝑃 ⁢ 𝐾 ⁢ 𝑀 𝐶 ⁢ ℎ ⁢ 𝐼 ⁢ 𝑃 / 𝑅 ⁢ 𝑃 ⁢ 𝐾 ⁢ 𝑀 𝑊 ⁢ 𝐶 ⁢ 𝐸
Reads from the bisulfite-treated library were trimmed using cutadapt ( https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ ) and analyzed with Bismark ( Krueger and Andrews, 2011 31. Krueger, F. ∙ Andrews, S.R. Bismark: a flexible aligner and methylation caller for Bisulfite-Seq applications Bioinformatics. 2011; 27 :1571-1572 Crossref Scopus (3173) PubMed Google Scholar ) using bowtie2 with the options:–score_min L,0,0. Unconverted reads were removed using Bismark-filter_non_conversion and methylation was called using the standard setting. To quantify CG methylation levels globally, data were further filtered using a custom Python script for signals at CG dinucleotide that displayed a fractional methylation of 0.5 or greater on both strands.
Differential methylation site (DMS) analysis was performed using CGmap tools ( https://cgmaptools.github.io ). Bismark outputs were converted into CGmap file using cgmaptools-convert-bismark2cgmap and then sorted and intersected with cgmaptools-sort and –intersect, respectively. Differential analysis was performed using cgmaptools-dms on the intersected files. Only sites of symmetric CG with > 50% methylation that were reproducible between technical replicates were considered in the analysis. DMS was considered significant when p value < 0.05.
Genomic DNA was extracted as described above with the only modification that the cells were incubated with lysis buffer for only 30 min at 65°C and other 30 min at room temperature.
Oxford Nanopore libraries were constructed using the 1D ligation kit (SQK-LSK108) and loaded on a FLO-MIN106 flow cell for each sample on a Minion. Basecalling was performed using Albacore v2.0.2. A total of 63- to 314-fold average genome coverage was generated for each of the eight samples. ONT fastq reads were assembled using Canu ( Koren et al., 2017 30. Koren, S. ∙ Walenz, B.P. ∙ Berlin, K. ... Canu: scalable and accurate long-read assembly via adaptive k -mer weighting and repeat separation Genome Res. 2017; 27 :722-736 Crossref Scopus (4413) PubMed Google Scholar ) release v1.5 with the following parameters: -nanopore-raw < input.fastq >, correctedErrorRate = 0.075, and stopOnReadQuality = false. The Canu1 assembly was corrected using nanopolish (v0.8.1); reads were aligned to the Canu assembly using bwa-mem2 ( Li, 2013 38. Li, H. Aligning sequence reads, clone sequences and assembly contigs with BWA-MEM arXiv. 2013; arXiv:1303.3997 Google Scholar ) (0.7.12) with the “-x ont2d” parameter and nanopolish ( https://github.com/jts/nanopolish ) v0.9 variants in–consensus mode was run on each contig to generate a polished consensus. Next, assemblies were manually inspected and edited as follows. Contig ends without telomere repeats were aligned using NUCmer3 ( Kurtz et al., 2004 32. Kurtz, S. ∙ Phillippy, A. ∙ Delcher, A.L. ... Versatile and open software for comparing large genomes Genome Biol. 2004; 5 :R12 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) to unassembled contigs and extended where alignments were uniquely mapped and contained both contig ends. Redundant small contigs with high identity NUCmer alignments to larger contigs were examined for read support; while all appeared redundant, some of these regions had higher accuracy and were used to correct the large contigs in two assemblies. Two manual joins between contigs were also made where supported by alignments to unassembled contigs. Alignment to the H99 genome4 ( Janbon et al., 2014 28. Janbon, G. ∙ Ormerod, K.L. ∙ Paulet, D. ... Analysis of the genome and transcriptome of Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii reveals complex RNA expression and microevolution leading to virulence attenuation PLoS Genet. 2014; 10 :e1004261 Crossref Scopus (286) PubMed Google Scholar ) with NUCmer was also used to validate these assemblies. All 8 assemblies showed the same rearrangement between H99 chromosomes 3 and 11; while seven of these assemblies appeared co-linear, Bt106 showed a unique rearrangement between H99 chromosomes 4 and 10 that was validated by read alignments. Finally, Illumina paired reads were aligned to the resulting polished contigs using bwa mem (version 0.7.7-r441) followed by Pilon5 ( Walker et al., 2014 58. Walker, B.J. ∙ Abeel, T. ∙ Shea, T. ... Pilon: an integrated tool for comprehensive microbial variant detection and genome assembly improvement PLoS ONE. 2014; 9 :e112963 Crossref Scopus (5536) PubMed Google Scholar ) (version 1.13) correction using the–fix all setting; this step was repeated for a second round of alignment and Pilon polishing.
WGBS library preparation was performed as described above and sequenced as SE150. Two technical replicates of the same genomic DNA were prepared for each sample. Reads from the bisulfite-treated library were analyzed in parallel with Bismark ( Krueger and Andrews, 2011 31. Krueger, F. ∙ Andrews, S.R. Bismark: a flexible aligner and methylation caller for Bisulfite-Seq applications Bioinformatics. 2011; 27 :1571-1572 Crossref Scopus (3173) PubMed Google Scholar ) and BSseeker2 ( Guo et al., 2013 20. Guo, W. ∙ Fiziev, P. ∙ Yan, W. ... BS-Seeker2: a versatile aligning pipeline for bisulfite sequencing data BMC Genomics. 2013; 14 :774 Crossref Scopus (293) PubMed Google Scholar ). Bismark alignment: bowtie2 with the options:–score_min L,0,0. Unconverted reads were removed using Bismark-filter_non_conversion and methylation was called using the standard setting. BSseeker2 alignment: bowtie2,–mismatches = 0–XS = 0.5, 5, call methylation: -x .
Bismark outputs were converted into CGmap file using cgmaptools-convert-bismark2cgmap ( https://cgmaptools.github.io ). The CGmap files from the technical replicates from BS-Seeker2 and Bismark were then cross-compared and only symmetric methylated CGs with at least 50% methylation and covered by > = 2 reads were considered in further analysis.
5mC calls on the Nanopore long reads data was performed using Nanopolish ( Simpson et al., 2017 54. Simpson, J.T. ∙ Workman, R.E. ∙ Zuzarte, P.C. ... Detecting DNA cytosine methylation using nanopore sequencing Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :407-410 Crossref Scopus (630) PubMed Google Scholar ) call-methylation and scripts/calculate_methylation_frequency.py.
The final table obtained was then converted into a CGmap file to be compared with our WGBS analysis. Since the calling 5mC with Nanopolish cannot distinguish methylated status of those CGs within 10bp of each other, the same methylation status was assigned to the entire group in the final CGmap. This results in a modest overestimation of the overall methylation status.
Centromeres were pairwise-aligned to a reference (A1-35-8) using NUCmer and only the longest increasing subset was kept for each alignment (delta-filter -q -r). Methylation calls from WGBS (for whole genome methylation analysis) or WGBS-combined with ONT-methylation calls (for methylation analysis on transposons) were then projected onto these coordinates.
For the whole genome methylation analysis ( Figure 7 D), we binned sites with conserved CG sequence in X number of strains (from N = 2 to 8) into CG conservation groups and asked the relative rates of methylation in each bin. A null distribution was derived by permuting within each group to mimic the heterogeneity in methylation expected given sequence conservation. We permuted only the CGs with at least one strain methylated ( Figure 7 D). For example, to generate the null distribution for strain Bt106 where 4 sites are shared, all the CGs that Bt106 shares with 3 other strains were permuted (conditional on at least one being methylated). This resulted in a much more conservative estimate than the fully random model.
Tcns were annotated by aligning the transposable sequences of C. neoformans var . neoformans obtained from RepBase ( https://www.girinst.org/repbase ) to the ONT assembled genomes. A custom script was utilized to BLAST the Tcn sequences and allowing a minimum of 10% identity between queries and targets followed by manual annotation and verification. The coordinates of each Tcn are described in Table S5 .
For the Tcn methylation analysis, a class of transposable elements was chosen (e.g., Tcn3), then the longest full-length Tcn in that class was chosen as a reference. Each Tcn was then aligned to the reference using Bioconductor pairwiseAlignment in global mode. WGBS were used to evaluate the methylation status. In cases where WGBS was not available (e.g., repetitive regions), we used the ONT calls to fill in the missing information. This is justified by high concordance between the two methods where there is bisulfite data (calculated as Pearson coefficient - Figure S7 E). Independence of methylation and sequence was tested by computing a goodness-of-fit at each site relative to the reference, conditioned on the aligned sequence. The procedure follows: 1) the expected value for each site was assumed to be the relative rate of methylation for the respective repeat (e.g., the random uniform model); 2) the statistic for each repeat at a specific C/G is (observed methylation status – repeat methylation rate) ˆ 2/ repeat methylation rate; 3) the per repeat and site statistic was then the sum across all repeats and sites. The null distribution was generated by permuting methylation status within each repeat then recomputing the test statistic 1000 times.
For phylogenetic analysis, orthologs were identified across sequenced Tremellales (C.A.C., unpublished data) based on BLASTP pairwise matches with expect < 1e-5 using ORTHOMCL v1.4 ( Li et al., 2003 39. Li, L. ∙ Stoeckert, Jr., C.J. ∙ Roos, D.S. OrthoMCL: identification of ortholog groups for eukaryotic genomes Genome Res. 2003; 13 :2178-2189 Crossref Scopus (4528) PubMed Google Scholar ). A phylogeny was estimated from 4080 single copy genes as follows. Individual proteins were aligned using MUSCLE ( Edgar, 2004 16. Edgar, R.C. MUSCLE: a multiple sequence alignment method with reduced time and space complexity BMC Bioinformatics. 2004; 5 :113 Crossref Scopus (6744) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the individual alignments were concatenated and poorly aligning regions removed with trimal ( Capella-Gutiérrez et al., 2009 9. Capella-Gutiérrez, S. ∙ Silla-Martínez, J.M. ∙ Gabaldón, T. trimAl: a tool for automated alignment trimming in large-scale phylogenetic analyses Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :1972-1973 Crossref Scopus (6635) PubMed Google Scholar ). This sequence was input to RAxML ( Stamatakis, 2006 55. Stamatakis, A. RAxML-VI-HPC: maximum likelihood-based phylogenetic analyses with thousands of taxa and mixed models Bioinformatics. 2006; 22 :2688-2690 Crossref Scopus (13922) PubMed Google Scholar ) version 7.7.8 (raxmlHPC-PTHREADS-SSE3) and a phylogeny estimated in rapid bootstrapping mode with model PROTCATWAG and 1,000 bootstrap replicates.
Protein and peptide identification were done with Integrated Proteomics Pipeline – IP2 (Integrated Proteomics Applications). Tandem mass spectra were extracted from raw files using RawConverter ( He et al., 2015 24. He, L. ∙ Diedrich, J. ∙ Chu, Y.Y. ... Extracting Accurate Precursor Information for Tandem Mass Spectra by RawConverter Anal. Chem. 2015; 87 :11361-11367 Crossref Scopus (197) PubMed Google Scholar ) and searched with ProLuCID ( Xu et al., 2015 62. Xu, T. ∙ Park, S.K. ∙ Venable, J.D. ... ProLuCID: An improved SEQUEST-like algorithm with enhanced sensitivity and specificity J. Proteomics. 2015; 129 :16-24 Crossref Scopus (334) PubMed Google Scholar )against Cryptococcus neoformans UniProt database. The search space included all fully-tryptic and half-tryptic peptide candidates. Carbamidomethylation on cysteine was considered as a static modification. Data was searched with 50 ppm precursor ion tolerance and 600 ppm fragment ion tolerance. Identified proteins were filtered using DTASelect ( Tabb et al., 2002 56. Tabb, D.L. ∙ McDonald, W.H. ∙ Yates, 3rd, J.R. DTASelect and Contrast: tools for assembling and comparing protein identifications from shotgun proteomics J. Proteome Res. 2002; 1 :21-26 Crossref Scopus (1188) PubMed Google Scholar ) and utilizing a target-decoy database search strategy to control the false discovery rate to 1% at the protein level ( Peng et al., 2003 49. Peng, J. ∙ Elias, J.E. ∙ Thoreen, C.C. ... Evaluation of multidimensional chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC/LC-MS/MS) for large-scale protein analysis: the yeast proteome J. Proteome Res. 2003; 2 :43-50 Crossref Scopus (1424) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Proteins that did not appear in the untagged control that displayed at least 10% sequence coverage in both duplicates were considered hits in our analysis. Common contaminants (e.g., ribosomal proteins) were removed from the analysis. The complete dataset can be found in Table S4 .
