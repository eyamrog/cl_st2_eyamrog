Title: Gut-innervating nociceptors regulate the intestinal microbiota to promote tissue protection


Abstract: Summary

Nociceptive pain is a hallmark of many chronic inflammatory conditions including inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs); however, whether pain-sensing neurons influence intestinal inflammation remains poorly defined. Employing chemogenetic silencing, adenoviral-mediated colon-specific silencing, and pharmacological ablation of TRPV1 + nociceptors, we observed more severe inflammation and defective tissue-protective reparative processes in a murine model of intestinal damage and inflammation. Disrupted nociception led to significant alterations in the intestinal microbiota and a transmissible dysbiosis, while mono-colonization of germ-free mice with Gram + Clostridium spp. promoted intestinal tissue protection through a nociceptor-dependent pathway. Mechanistically, disruption of nociception resulted in decreased levels of substance P, and therapeutic delivery of substance P promoted tissue-protective effects exerted by TRPV1 + nociceptors in a microbiota-dependent manner. Finally, dysregulated nociceptor gene expression was observed in intestinal biopsies from IBD patients. Collectively, these findings indicate an evolutionarily conserved functional link between nociception, the intestinal microbiota, and the restoration of intestinal homeostasis.

Section: Introduction

Pain is an evolutionarily conserved sensory and emotional response that can serve as an early warning signal to protect the body from tissue damage or injury ( Baral et al., 2019 6.

However, chronic pain produces severe distress and impairs the quality of life of an estimated 50 million patients in the US who are diagnosed with chronic inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), with the estimated cost of treating chronic pain exceeding $600 billion annually ( Dahlhamer et al., 2018 28.

IBD represents a group of chronic inflammatory diseases characterized by ongoing inflammation of all or part of the gastrointestinal tract ( Abraham and Cho, 2009 1. Abraham, C. ∙ Cho, J.H.

Abdominal pain is a common symptom of IBD, which is thought to arise from different mechanisms including gut distention, intestinal inflammation, and microbial dysbiosis ( Baral et al., 2019 6.

Pain-sensing neurons, which innervate peripheral tissues, including the skin, lung, and gastrointestinal tract, transduce environmental signals including thermal stimulation, noxious stimuli, and mechanical damage to the central nervous system and are indispensable for effective pathogen defense and tissue homeostasis ( Baral et al., 2019 6.

Nociceptors are a specialized subset of sensory neurons expressing transient receptor vanilloid 1 (TRPV1), a non-selective cation channel that can be activated by a wide variety of stimuli including heat, capsaicin, and inflammatory mediators ( Basbaum et al., 2009 8.

Upon activation, the nerve terminals of nociceptors release calcitonin-gene-related peptide (CGRP, encoded by Calca ), substance P (SP, encoded by Tac1 ), and other neuropeptides, which either amplify or inhibit the downstream inflammatory cascade ( Chu et al., 2020 21.

Immunol. 2022; 76 :102205 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Despite emerging advances in understanding neuro-immune interactions, it remains unclear whether nociceptors play a role in regulating the development, severity, and/or resolution of chronic inflammatory diseases such as IBD.
Here, we visualized TRPV1 + nociceptor innervation in mouse intestines during homeostasis and inflammation. Targeted chemogenetic silencing, adenoviral-mediated colon-specific silencing, or pharmacological ablation of TRPV1 + nociceptors resulted in enhanced susceptibility in a murine model of intestinal damage and inflammation, indicating that gut-innervating TRPV1 + nociceptors are tissue protective in these contexts. Transient silencing or permanent ablation of TRPV1 + nociceptors resulted in alterations in the composition of the intestinal microbiota, and transplantation of the microbiota from mice with dysregulated nociception resulted in exacerbated intestinal damage and inflammation in wild-type recipient mice. Disruption of TRPV1 + nociceptor-mediated tissue-protective functions were associated with alterations in Gram + bacteria and selective colonization of nociceptor-sufficient, but not nociceptor-deficient, germ-free (GF) mice with a consortium of Gram + Clostridium species promoted tissue protection. Critically, levels of nociceptor-derived SP were reduced upon chemogenetic silencing or pharmacological ablation of TRPV1 + nociceptors and therapeutic delivery of SP limited severe inflammation in mice with disrupted nociception. Lastly, we detected dysregulated patterns of TRPV1 + nociceptor innervation and altered expression of nociceptor-associated genes including TRPV1 and TAC1 in intestinal biopsies from IBD patients compared with healthy controls, indicating that dysregulation of nociception is an evolutionarily conserved feature of chronic intestinal inflammation. Taken together, these results highlight the role of gut-innervating nociceptors in regulating the composition of the microbiota required to limit inflammation and promote intestinal tissue protection.

Section: Results

The gastrointestinal tract is densely innervated by both intrinsic and extrinsic neurons including components of the sensory nervous system ( Veiga-Fernandes and Mucida, 2016 96.

To assess whether TRPV1 + nociceptors innervate the mouse colon, we first crossed Trpv1 -Cre mice with a cell lineage reporter mouse line tdTomato fl/stop/fl to examine the distribution of TRPV1 + nociceptors in naive and inflamed mouse colons. TRPV1-tdTomato, in conjunction with a pan-neuronal marker βIII-tubulin, marked TRPV1 + nociceptor innervation in the crypts and muscularis in the colon at steady state as well as following exposure to dextran sodium sulfate (DSS), a murine model of intestinal damage and inflammation ( Monticelli et al., 2015 65.

To interrogate the potential functional impact of gut-innervating TRPV1 + nociceptors on intestinal damage and inflammation, we employed a chemogenetic approach to acutely silence TRPV1 + nociceptors in vivo by generating TRPV1 hM4Di mice in which TRPV1 + nociceptors express the inhibitory designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) human M4 muscarinic receptor (hM4Di) ( Ferguson et al., 2011 35.

Toxicol. 2015; 55 :399-417 Crossref Scopus (387) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure S1 A). Expression of hM4Di was detected by immunofluorescence microscopy in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG, where the cell bodies of TRPV1 + nociceptors innervating the intestine are located; Riol-Blanco et al., 2014 76.

Woolf, C.J. ∙ Ma, Q. Nociceptors--noxious stimulus detectors Neuron. 2007; 55 :353-364 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (622) PubMed Google Scholar ) of TRPV1 hM4Di but not littermate control TRPV1 wt/wt mice ( Figure S1 B, yellow arrows). Delivery of the inactive clozapine analog clozapine-N-oxide (CNO), a synthetic ligand for the engineered receptor hM4Di, resulted in transient silencing of TRPV1 + nociceptors as indicated by significantly reduced phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase 3/1 immunoreactive neurons ( Figures S1 C and S1D), which can be induced in DRG neurons by intense stimulation or under chronic pathological conditions ( Guo et al., 2020 41. Guo, C.J. ∙ Mack, M.R. ∙ Oetjen, L.K. ... Kallikrein 7 promotes atopic dermatitis-associated itch independently of skin inflammation J. Invest. Dermatol. 2020; 140 :1244-1252.e4 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ). The DREADD-mediated acute silencing of TRPV1 + nociceptors did not affect baseline body mass ( Figure S1 E), food and water intake ( Figures S1 F and S1G), or total gastrointestinal transit time following DSS administration ( Figure S1 H). However, DSS-exposed TRPV1 hM4Di mice exhibited significantly more body weight loss ( Figure 1 C), a significant increase in clinical disease score including parameters of general morbidity, rectal bleeding, and diarrhea ( Figure 1 D), and significantly reduced colon length ( Figure 1 E) compared with littermate control TRPV1 wt/wt mice. Further, when littermate control mice began recovering from DSS-induced intestinal damage, TRPV1 hM4Di mice exhibited increased inflammatory cell infiltration, intestinal edema, the loss of epithelial crypt structure ( Figure 1 F), and significantly reduced numbers of goblet cells in the distal colon ( Figures 1 G and 1H), indicative of defective tissue repair machinery following acute silencing of TRPV1 + nociceptors.
We next analyzed intestinal immune cell responses upon TRPV1 + nociceptor silencing during DSS-induced colitis. TRPV1 + nociceptor-silenced mice exhibited a significant increase in neutrophil infiltration in the colon compared with control littermates, suggesting more severe intestinal inflammation ( Figures 1 I and 1J). However, the percentages of colonic IL-17A- or IFNγ-producing CD4 + T cells ( Figures 1 K–1M) and regulatory T cells (Treg cells) ( Figures S1 I–S1K) were comparable between TRPV1 hM4Di and littermate control TRPV1 wt/wt mice. Taken together, these data suggest that TRPV1 + nociceptors play a critical role in regulating tissue damage, inflammation, and repair in the intestine, without substantially impacting the adaptive immune response in this setting.
To specifically manipulate TRPV1 + nociceptors in the intestine, we injected a Cre-dependent AAV9 virus carrying the inhibitory DREADD into the distal colons of Trpv1 -Cre mice and treated these mice with CNO to acutely silence colon-innervating TRPV1 + nociceptors following DSS administration ( Figure S1 L; Gore et al., 2019 40.

Expression of mCherry was detected by immunofluorescence microscopy in the lumbar DRG (L5/L6/S1) ( Figure S1 M), with significantly more mCherry + neurons labeled in the lumbar DRG compared with the nodose vagal ganglion ( Figures S1 N and S1O), which is consistent with previous findings that vagal neurons predominantly innervate the proximal colon whereas DRG neurons mainly innervate the jejunum and distal colon in mice ( Guo et al., 2019b 43.

Compared with Trpv1 -Cre mice with distal colonic injection of control virus (AAV9-hSyn-DIO-mCherry), Trpv1 -Cre mice injected with AAV9 virus carrying the inhibitory DREADD (AAV9-hSyn-DIO-hM4D(Gi)-mCherry) exhibited significantly more weight loss ( Figure 1 N), significantly increased colon shortening ( Figure 1 O), and significantly more crypt loss in the distal colon ( Figure 1 P). Together, these data suggest that gut-innervating TRPV1 + nociceptors are critical in mediating tissue protection during intestinal damage and inflammation.
In addition to loss-of-function chemogenetic approaches, we sought to investigate whether activation of TRPV1 + nociceptors impacted DSS-induced intestinal damage and inflammation. We employed a gain-of-function chemogenetic approach to activate TRPV1 + nociceptors in vivo by generating TRPV1 hM3Dq mice in which TRPV1 + nociceptors expressed the excitatory human M3 muscarinic receptor (hM3Dq) ( Ferguson et al., 2011 35. Ferguson, S.M. ∙ Eskenazi, D. ∙ Ishikawa, M. ... Transient neuronal inhibition reveals opposing roles of indirect and direct pathways in sensitization Nat. Neurosci. 2011; 14 :22-24 Crossref Scopus (328) PubMed Google Scholar ). Chemogenetic activation of TRPV1 + nociceptors following DSS administration resulted in significantly less body weight loss ( Figure S1 P). There were significantly decreased disease activity ( Figure S1 Q), less colon shortening ( Figure S1 R), improved histopathology of the distal colon ( Figure S1 S), and reduced neutrophil infiltration in the colon ( Figure S1 T) upon chemogenetic activation of TRPV1 + nociceptors following DSS administration, further supporting a tissue-protective role exerted by TRPV1 + nociceptors in this mouse model of intestinal inflammation.
We employed a complementary pharmacological strategy to permanently ablate TRPV1 + nociceptors in adult mice in vivo . Subcutaneous injections of resiniferatoxin (RTX), a potent TRPV1 channel agonist, result in systemic ablation of TRPV1 + nociceptors ( Elekes et al., 2007 34. Elekes, K. ∙ Helyes, Z. ∙ Németh, J. ... Role of capsaicin-sensitive afferents and sensory neuropeptides in endotoxin-induced airway inflammation and consequent bronchial hyperreactivity in the mouse Regul.

Mishra, S.K. ∙ Hoon, M.A. Ablation of TrpV1 neurons reveals their selective role in thermal pain sensation Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2010; 43 :157-163 Crossref Scopus (93) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure S2 A), allowing us to investigate the influence of nociceptors on intestinal damage, inflammation, and repair in diverse mouse models and experimental settings. RTX-mediated TRPV1 + nociceptor ablation in wild-type B6 mice was confirmed by diminished expression of nociceptor marker gene including Trpv1 , Tac1 , and Scn10a in the DRG ( Figure 2 A). Importantly, RTX treatment resulted in significantly fewer TRPV1 + neurons in the DRG ( Figures 2 B and 2C), suggesting successful TRPV1 + nociceptor ablation.
To examine the consequences of nociceptor ablation under conditions of intestinal damage and inflammation, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)- and RTX-treated wild-type mice were exposed to DSS, and parameters of clinical disease were monitored ( Figure S2 A). Notably, RTX-mediated ablation of TRPV1 + nociceptors did not affect baseline body mass ( Figure S2 B), baseline total gastrointestinal transit time ( Figure S2 C), food and water intake ( Figures 2 D and 2E), locomotion ( Figure 2 F), or energy expenditure ( Figure 2 G). In comparison with DMSO-treated mice, RTX-treated mice exhibited overall heightened disease activity as reflected by significantly more weight loss ( Figure 2 H), a significant increase in clinical disease score ( Figure 2 I), and significantly reduced colon length ( Figure 2 J). Furthermore, histological examination of the distal colon tissue revealed that RTX-treated mice, similar to TRPV1 hM4Di mice, exhibited more severe histopathological changes within the intestinal mucosa including prominent tissue ulceration, edema, increased inflammatory cell infiltration ( Figure 2 K), and significantly reduced numbers of goblet cells ( Figures 2 L and 2M) relative to DMSO-treated mice.
Next, we sought to investigate whether immune responses were influenced by RTX-mediated ablation of nociceptors. At steady state, there were no significant changes in most immune cell populations in the colon lamina propria upon RTX-mediated nociceptor ablation ( Figures S2 D–S2L). However, consistent with chemogenetic silencing of TRPV1 + nociceptors, following exposure to DSS, nociceptor-ablated mice exhibited a significant increase in colonic neutrophil frequency relative to control mice, a hallmark of more severe intestinal inflammation ( Figures 2 N and 2O). The percentages of colonic IL-17A- and IFNγ-producing CD4 + T cells were comparable ( Figures 2 P–2R), and there were no significant differences in the percentages of colonic Treg cells ( Figures S2 M–S2O) between DMSO- and RTX-treated mice.
Since TRPV1 + nociceptors innervating the mouse intestine are either from DRG or nodose ganglion ( Chavan et al., 2017 19. Chavan, S.S. ∙ Pavlov, V.A. ∙ Tracey, K.J. Mechanisms and therapeutic relevance of neuro-immune communication Immunity. 2017; 46 :927-942 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (299) PubMed Google Scholar ), we next determined whether DRG nociceptors contributed to tissue protection following DSS-induced colitis using intrathecal injection of DMSO or RTX. Following DSS administration, mice ablated of TRPV1 + DRG nociceptors exhibited overall increased disease severity as reflected by significantly more weight loss ( Figure S2 P), a significant increase in clinical disease score ( Figure S2 Q), and more severe histopathology in the distal colon ( Figure S2 R). Collectively, by using both transient chemogenetic silencing and permanent pharmacological ablation of TRPV1 + nociceptors, we identify that gut-innervating TRPV1 + nociceptors are necessary to limit inflammation and promote tissue repair in the context of intestinal damage.
The intestinal microbiota interact with the immune system and the nervous system and participate in the regulation of multiple inflammatory disorders including asthma and IBD as well as neurological disorders such as neurodegenerative diseases and chronic pain ( Chu et al., 2019 22.

To investigate whether there is crosstalk between the intestinal microbiota and TRPV1 + nociceptors that influences the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis, we first analyzed bacterial communities by 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing from fecal DNA samples isolated from DMSO- and RTX-treated mice at steady state. Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) demonstrated that samples clustered largely by treatment ( Figure 3 A), indicating significant changes in the composition of the intestinal microbiota in RTX-treated mice compared with DMSO-treated mice. Specifically, the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes spp. was significantly decreased while that of Firmicutes spp. was increased in RTX-treated mice ( Figures 3 B and 3C), indicating a potential role of TRPV1 + nociceptors play in regulating the composition of the microbiota.
Given that microbial dysbiosis is a key factor associated with human IBD and murine models of intestinal damage and inflammation ( Abraham and Cho, 2009 1. Abraham, C. ∙ Cho, J.H.

Uhlig, H.H. ∙ Powrie, F. Translating immunology into therapeutic concepts for inflammatory bowel disease Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2018; 36 :755-781 Crossref Scopus (90) PubMed Google Scholar ), we sought to test whether the dysbiotic intestinal microbiota elicited by ablation of TRPV1 + nociceptors could influence intestinal inflammation or tissue protection in vivo . To examine whether RTX-induced dysbiosis could transfer disease phenotypes, we employed fecal microbiota transfer (FMT) from DMSO- or RTX-treated wild-type specific-pathogen-free (SPF) mice into wild-type GF recipients (labeled “FMT-DMSO” or “FMT-RTX”) by oral gavage of cecal content-derived material from donor mice ( Figure S3 A). In the FMT donor groups, upon either systemic RTX-mediated ablation or intrathecal RTX-mediated ablation of TRPV1 + nociceptors, bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed notable changes in the composition of the intestinal microbiota at the family and genus level, including a reduction in the relative abundance of the Bacteroides genus, the Clostridium XIVa genus, the Parabacteroides genus, the Porphyromonadaceae family and the Bacteroidales order, as well as an increase in the relative abundance of the Lactobacillus genus and the Erysipelotrichaceae family ( Figure 3 D, FMT donor and Figure S3 B). 6 weeks following FMT, bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing of fecal contents from recipient mice revealed preserved alterations in the abundance of certain taxa between DMSO- or RTX-treated donor mice and their corresponding recipient mice, including reduced levels of Clostridium XIVa , Parabacteroides , and Bacteroidales , as well as increased level of Erysipelotrichaceae family ( Figure 3 D, FMT recipient). These observations indicate that the microbial dysbiosis from RTX-treated mice could be transferred and maintained in GF wild-type recipient mice.
Following FMT, recipient mice were then exposed to DSS and parameters of clinical disease were monitored ( Figure S3 A). While FMT-DMSO mice recovered from DSS-induced intestinal damage, FMT-RTX mice displayed persistent weight loss ( Figure 3 E), significantly elevated clinical disease activity ( Figure 3 F), and significantly shortened colon length ( Figure 3 G), along with more severe histopathologic features including immune cell infiltration and loss of crypt structure ( Figure 3 H). Increased neutrophil influx was also detected in the FMT-RTX mice compared with FMT-DMSO mice ( Figures 3 I and 3J), suggesting a role for the intestinal microbiota in driving the inflammatory response in the context of a disruption in nociceptive sensing. We performed additional natural microbiota reconstitution experiments by cohousing GF mice (recipient mice) with either DMSO- or RTX-treated SPF mice (donor mice) for 4 weeks and exposed both donor and recipient mice to DSS ( Figure S3 C). As expected, in the donor group, RTX treatment (donor-RTX) resulted in exacerbated disease severity compared with DMSO treatment (donor-DMSO) ( Figure 3 K). Consistent with the FMT experiments by oral gavage, GF B6 mice cohoused with RTX-treated mice (recipient-RTX) exhibited significantly increased weight loss ( Figure 3 K), higher clinical disease score ( Figure 3 L), increased colon shortening ( Figure 3 M), and more severe histopathology ( Figure 3 N) compared with GF mice cohoused with DMSO-treated mice (recipient-DMSO). Taken together, FMT and cohousing experiments suggest that RTX-mediated ablation of TRPV1 + nociceptors results in a transmissible dysbiosis that drives defective tissue protection upon intestinal damage.
Similar to RTX-mediated TRPV1 + nociceptor ablation, DREADD-mediated acute silencing of TRPV1 + nociceptors resulted in significant alterations in the composition of the intestinal microbiota following DSS administration ( Figures S3 D and S3E). To investigate the role of the intestinal microbiota in TRPV1 + nociceptor-mediated tissue protection in the chemogenetic mouse model, we exposed either TRPV1 wt/wt mice and TRPV1 hM4Di mice (separately housed by genotype), or cohoused TRPV1 wt/wt and TRPV1 hM4Di mice to DSS in drinking water and monitored disease progression ( Figure S3 F). Separately housed TRPV1 hM4Di mice were more susceptible to DSS-induced colitis compared with separately housed TRPV1 wt/wt mice, while TRPV1 hM4Di mice cohoused with TRPV1 wt/wt control mice exhibited similar susceptibility compared with cohoused TRPV1 wt/wt control mice, as reflected by similar weight loss ( Figure S3 G), slightly higher clinical disease score ( Figure S3 H), comparable colon length ( Figure S3 I), comparable neutrophil infiltration ( Figure S3 J), and similar histopathology in the distal colon ( Figure S3 K). Although separately housed and cohoused TRPV1 wt/wt mice exhibited similar weight loss and colon shortening, clinical disease activity and severe histopathology was notable in the cohoused TRPV1 wt/wt mice compared with separately housed TRPV1 wt/wt mice, indicating that TRPV1 + nociceptor silencing-mediated dysbiosis is transmissible to wild-type controls cohoused in the same cage. Collectively, these data demonstrate that RTX-mediated ablation and chemogenetic silencing of TRPV1 + nociceptors lead to a transmissible dysbiosis, which is sufficient to confer enhanced susceptibility to DSS-induced intestinal damage and inflammation.
To test whether the intestinal microbiota is required to drive the enhanced susceptibility to DSS-induced colitis in SPF mice upon RTX-mediated ablation of TRPV1 + nociceptors, we employed established approaches ( Alenghat et al., 2013 2.

Broad spectrum ABX treatment eliminated RTX-mediated exacerbation of DSS-induced intestinal damage and inflammation, as both ABX-treated DMSO groups and ABX-treated RTX groups exhibited similar weight loss ( Figure 4 B), comparable clinical disease score ( Figure 4 C) and colon length ( Figure 4 D), and similar histological architecture in the distal colon ( Figure 4 E). These findings indicate that following ablation of TRPV1 + nociceptors, signals derived from the intestinal microbiota promote severe intestinal inflammation.
We next employed individual ABX to determine the specific microbial communities that influence TRPV1 + nociceptor-mediated tissue protection during DSS-induced colitis. Following vancomycin treatment (which preferentially depletes Gram + bacteria), RTX-mediated susceptibility to DSS was comparable to DMSO treatment group, as indicated by similar weight loss ( Figure 4 F), similar clinical disease score ( Figure 4 G), comparable colon length ( Figure 4 H), and similar histological architecture in the distal colon ( Figure 4 I). In contrast, following neomycin treatment (which preferentially depletes Gram − bacteria), RTX-treated mice exhibited enhanced susceptibility to DSS, as reflected by significantly more weight loss ( Figure 4 J), significantly increased clinical disease score ( Figure 4 K), significantly reduced colon length ( Figure 4 L), and more severe histopathological changes within the intestinal mucosa, including prominent crypt loss and edema compared with control mice ( Figure 4 M). Together, these data suggest that vancomycin-sensitive bacteria are required for the enhanced susceptibility to DSS-induced colitis upon nociceptor ablation. It is possible that vancomycin and neomycin treatment result in alterations in relative abundance and functionality of the remaining vancomycin- or neomycin-resistant bacterial communities, which might also account for the disease phenotype upon RTX-mediated nociceptor ablation.
Since we observed profound alterations in the composition of the intestinal microbiota upon RTX-mediated nociceptor ablation in the SPF setting ( Figure 3 D), we sought to test whether specific bacterial species are sufficient to drive exacerbated intestinal inflammation following RTX-mediated ablation of TRPV1 + nociceptors using different vendor-sourced mice and established gnotobiotic mouse models. First, we employed RTX-mediated TRPV1 + nociceptor ablation in Taconic-sourced B6 mice (which have been reported to carry high levels of segmented filamentous bacteria [SFB]) versus JAX-sourced B6 mice (that are SFB negative) ( Ivanov et al., 2009 50. Ivanov, I.I. ∙ Atarashi, K. ∙ Manel, N. ... Induction of intestinal Th17 cells by segmented filamentous bacteria Cell. 2009; 139 :485-498 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (3095) PubMed Google Scholar ) to test whether TRPV1 + nociceptors mediate tissue protection in mice that carry vendor-specific microbiota. Compared with DMSO-treated Taconic B6, RTX-treated Taconic B6 were more susceptible to DSS-induced colitis, characterized by significantly more weight loss ( Figure S4 A), significantly elevated clinical disease score ( Figure S4 B), significantly increased colon shortening ( Figure S4 C), and more severe histopathology ( Figure S4 D). Thus, consistent with results from SFB-negative JAX B6 mice ( Figure 2 ), ablation of nociceptors lead to enhanced susceptibility to DSS-induced colitis in SFB-positive Taconic B6 mice.
Second, based on results from the bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing showing altered abundances of specific bacteria taxa including the Bacteroides genus, the Clostridium XIVa genus, and the Erysipelotrichaceae family ( Figure 3 D) upon nociceptor disruption, we utilized gnotobiotic mouse models with GF mice colonized with defined consortia of microbial communities, specifically (1) the Clostridium spp. consortia (Gram + ) ( Atarashi et al., 2011 5. Atarashi, K. ∙ Tanoue, T. ∙ Shima, T. ... Induction of colonic regulatory T cells by indigenous Clostridium species Science. 2011; 331 :337-341 Crossref Scopus (2524) PubMed Google Scholar , 2013 4. Atarashi, K. ∙ Tanoue, T. ∙ Oshima, K. ... Treg induction by a rationally selected mixture of Clostridia strains from the human microbiota Nature. 2013; 500 :232-236 Crossref Scopus (1811) PubMed Google Scholar ), (2) a combination of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (Gram − ) and Enterococcus faecium (Gram + ) (Bt+Ef), or (3) altered Schaedler flora (ASF), a well-established minimal microbial consortium in mice ( Schaedler and Dubos, 1962 80. Schaedler, R.W. ∙ Dubos, R.J. The fecal flora of various strains of mice. Its bearing on their susceptibility to endotoxin J. Exp. Med. 1962; 115 :1149-1160 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure S4 E). Bt+Ef colonized ex-GF B6 mice ( Figures S4 F–S4I) and ASF mice ( Figures S4 J–S4M) exhibited similar colitis susceptibility between DMSO- and RTX-treated groups, indicating that these bacterial communities were not sufficient to drive the enhanced susceptibility to DSS-induced intestinal pathology observed in RTX-treated SPF mice. In contrast, RTX-mediated ablation of TRPV1 + nociceptors in Clostridium spp. consortia-colonized ex-GF mice resulted in a similar colitis phenotype to that observed in SPF B6 mice ( Figures 4 N–4Q), indicating that Clostridium spp. colonization is sufficient to drive enhanced susceptibility to DSS-induced colitis in the absence of TRPV1 + nociceptors.
To further investigate whether certain bacteria contribute to TRPV1 + nociceptor-mediated tissue protection, we focused on several bacterial species that exhibited altered abundance following RTX treatment in SPF B6 mice. We investigated this by using nociceptor-sufficient GF B6 mice mono-colonized with Gram − bacteria including Bacteroides fragilis and Prevotella copri , or Gram + bacteria including Clostridium innocuum and Clostridium sporogenes ( Figure S4 N). Compared with GF B6 mice, Gram + bacterial colonization resulted in less weight loss and increased survival rate ( Figures S4 O and S4P), indicating a tissue-protective role played by Gram + Clostridium spp. in ex-GF mice with intact nociception. Taken together, results from ABX and gnotobiotic experiments demonstrate that vancomycin-sensitive Gram + bacteria are required to drive enhanced susceptibility to DSS-induced colitis in the absence of TRPV1 + nociceptors. Of note, mono-colonization with a consortium of Clostridium spp. in nociceptor-deficient ex-GF mice was sufficient to drive exacerbated intestinal inflammation. In contrast, mono-colonization of nociceptor-sufficient ex-GF mice with Clostridium spp. promoted intestinal tissue protection through a nociceptor-dependent pathway. Although RTX-mediated nociceptor ablation resulted in overall increased abundance of Firmicutes spp., most of which are Gram + , there were reduced levels of Clostridium spp. while increased levels of Erysipelotrichaceae within this phylum ( Figures 3 B–3D), indicating that TRPV1 + nociceptors play a critical role in maintaining the balance of protective and pathogenic microbes to promote tissue protection during intestinal damage ( Atarashi et al., 2013 4.

Activation of the TRPV1 ion channel on nociceptors results in the release of vesicles containing nociceptive neuropeptides including CGRP and SP from the activated nerve terminals ( Baral et al., 2019 6. Baral, P. ∙ Udit, S. ∙ Chiu, I.M. Pain and immunity: implications for host defence Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2019; 19 :433-447 Crossref Scopus (139) PubMed Google Scholar ; Suvas, 2017 86. Suvas, S. Role of substance P neuropeptide in inflammation, wound healing, and tissue homeostasis J. Immunol. 2017; 199 :1543-1552 Crossref Scopus (153) PubMed Google Scholar ). Analysis of a single-cell RNA-seq dataset of the murine nervous system, which enables the examination of gene expression across different tissues, revealed that two of the most highly expressed neuropeptides from TRPV1 + nociceptors are SP (encoded by Tac1 ) and CGRP (encoded by Calca ), whereas intrinsic enteric neurons highly express neuropeptides including VIP and NMU ( Figure S5 A; Zeisel et al., 2018 106. Zeisel, A. ∙ Hochgerner, H. ∙ Lönnerberg, P. ... Molecular architecture of the mouse nervous system Cell. 2018; 174 :999-1014.e22 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (967) PubMed Google Scholar ). Tac1 has also been shown to be expressed in enteric neuron subsets and enteroendocrine cells in the mouse colon ( Billing et al., 2019 13. Billing, L.J. ∙ Larraufie, P. ∙ Lewis, J. ... Single cell transcriptomic profiling of large intestinal enteroendocrine cells in mice - Identification of selective stimuli for insulin-like peptide-5 and glucagon-like peptide-1 co-expressing cells Mol.

Morarach, K. ∙ Mikhailova, A. ∙ Knoflach, V. ... Diversification of molecularly defined myenteric neuron classes revealed by single-cell RNA sequencing Nat. Neurosci. 2021; 24 :34-46 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, we assessed the mRNA expression of Trpv1 and Tac1 across multiple tissues in SPF B6 mice at steady state and detected the highest expression in the DRG ( Figures S5 B and S5C). In addition, Tac1 expression was minimally detected in either the lamina propria or the muscularis layer, whereas Nmu expression was significantly enriched in the muscularis layer compared with the lamina propria in the colons of SPF B6 mice at steady state ( Figure S5 D). Taken together, these results indicate that while Nmu is highly expressed in intrinsic enteric neurons, Tac1 is primarily expressed in the DRG.
Next, we sought to investigate if there are any alterations of SP or CGRP levels upon nociceptor disruption. Chemogenetic silencing ( Figures 5 A–5D) and RTX-mediated ablation ( Figures 5 E and 5F) of TRPV1 + nociceptors resulted in significantly reduced colonic SP and CGRP levels following DSS administration, indicating that TRPV1 + nociceptors are a major source of SP and CGRP in the inflamed mouse colon. SP has been reported to play a protective role in preserving epithelial barrier function ( Suvas, 2017 86. Suvas, S. Role of substance P neuropeptide in inflammation, wound healing, and tissue homeostasis J. Immunol. 2017; 199 :1543-1552 Crossref Scopus (153) PubMed Google Scholar ); thus, we first investigated whether administration of SP is sufficient for TRPV1 + nociceptor-mediated tissue protection via gain-of-function experiments. SP administration attenuated disease severity in RTX-treated B6 mice as reflected by significantly less body weight loss ( Figure 5 G), reduced clinical disease score ( Figure 5 H), less colon shortening ( Figure 5 I), and improved histopathology in the distal colon ( Figure 5 J). In addition, administration of SP upon DREADD-mediated silencing of TRPV1 + nociceptors following exposure to DSS resulted in less severe weight loss ( Figure 5 K), attenuated disease activity ( Figure 5 L), reduced colon shortening ( Figure 5 M), and improved histopathology in the distal colon ( Figure 5 N). Consistently, SP administration ameliorated disease severity observed in Trpv1 -Cre mice injected with AAV9 virus carrying the inhibitory DREADD (AAV9-hSyn-DIO-hM4D(Gi)-mCherry) following DSS administration ( Figures S5 E–S5H). Collectively, these data indicate that one mechanism through which TRPV1 + nociceptors promote tissue protection is via the nociceptive neuropeptide SP.
We also utilized a genetic loss-of-function approach to further investigate the role of SP in mediating tissue protection during DSS-induced intestinal damage and inflammation by using the Tac1 −/− mouse line. At steady state, Tac1 −/− mice exhibited similar percentages of most immune cells in the colon ( Figures S6 A–S6I). SP deficiency did not affect baseline body mass ( Figure S6 J), food and water intake ( Figures S6 K and S6L), or total gastrointestinal transit time ( Figure S6 M). However, mice lacking SP demonstrated enhanced susceptibility to DSS-induced colitis compared with wild-type control mice ( Tac1 +/+ ), as reflected by significantly more body weight loss ( Figure 6 A), a significant increase in clinical disease score ( Figure 6 B), and significantly reduced colon length ( Figure 6 C). Furthermore, when wild-type control mice began recovering from DSS-induced intestinal damage, Tac1 −/− mice exhibited severe intestinal damage and loss-of-tissue-reparative processes characterized by absence of epithelial crypt structure with inflammatory cell infiltration and intestinal edema in the distal colon ( Figure 6 D). The neutrophil infiltration in the colon was comparable between Tac1 −/− mice and wild-type control mice ( Tac1 +/+ ) following exposure to DSS ( Figures S6 N and S6O). Similarly, there were no significant differences in the percentages of colonic Treg cells ( Figures S6 P–S6R). There was comparable proportion of colonic IL-17A-producing CD4 + T cells but increased proportion of IFNγ-producing CD4 + T cells in Tac1 −/− mice compared with wild-type control mice ( Figures S6 S–S6U). Critically, following DSS administration, DMSO- and RTX-treated Tac1 −/− mice exhibited comparable weight loss ( Figure 6 E), clinical disease score ( Figure 6 F), colon length ( Figure 6 G), and histopathology of the distal colon ( Figure 6 H), indicating that SP is required to integrate the tissue-protective functions of TRPV1 + nociceptors upon intestinal damage. Taken together, these data suggest that TRPV1 + nociceptor-derived SP controls susceptibility to DSS-induced intestinal damage and inflammation.
To investigate whether SP regulates the composition of the intestinal microbiota, we analyzed fecal bacterial communities by 16S rRNA gene sequencing in samples isolated from Tac1 +/+ and Tac1 −/− mice at steady state. The PCoA plot demonstrated that samples clustered largely by genotype, indicating that SP plays a role in regulating the composition of the intestinal microbiota ( Figure 6 I). Changes in specific taxa were shared between RTX-mediated TRPV1 + nociceptor ablation and genetic deletion of SP, including reduced levels of Bacteroides , Porphyromonadaceae , Parabacteroides , and Clostridium_XIVa , and increased level of Erysipelotrichaceae ( Figures 3 D and 6 J).
To investigate the causal relationship between altered intestinal microbiota and impaired tissue protection upon genetic deletion of SP, we cohoused Tac1 +/+ mice and Tac1 −/− mice and monitored disease progression following DSS administration. Enhanced susceptibility to DSS-induced colitis observed in Tac1 −/− mice was abolished following cohousing with Tac1 +/+ mice, reflected by comparable body weight loss ( Figure 6 K), similar disease activity ( Figure 6 L), comparable colon length shortening ( Figure 6 M), and comparable histopathology ( Figure 6 N) between cohoused Tac1 +/+ mice and Tac1 −/− mice. Further, transplantation of the intestinal microbiota from Tac1 −/− mice into ex-GF B6 mice resulted in significantly more severe DSS-induced colitis compared with ex-GF mice receiving intestinal microbiota from Tac1 +/+ mice, with significantly more weight loss ( Figure 6 O), significantly higher clinical disease score ( Figure 6 P), significantly shortened colon length ( Figure 6 Q), and more severe histopathology in the distal colon ( Figure 6 R). Together, these results suggest that SP exerts tissue-protective effects by modulating the composition of the intestinal microbiota.
To investigate whether TRPV1 + nociceptors are regulated by intestinal inflammation and dysbiosis, we measured levels of SP and CGRP in naive and inflamed colons of DSS-exposed mice and observed significantly increased levels of these neuropeptides following DSS administration ( Figures 7 A and 7B), suggesting that nociceptive neurons are actively functioning in the context of intestinal inflammation. To investigate whether there is crosstalk between the microbiota and nociceptors, we measured levels of SP and CGRP in the colons of FMT recipient mice following DSS administration. Compared with the FMT-DMSO group, the FMT-RTX group exhibited significantly reduced levels of SP but similar levels of CGRP in the colon ( Figures 7 C and 7D). There were also significantly decreased levels of SP, but not CGRP, in the colons of GF B6 mice compared with SPF B6 mice following DSS administration ( Figures 7 E and 7F). Together, these data suggest that specific bacterial species modulated by TRPV1 + nociceptors provide positive feedback by activating nociceptors, further promoting SP production and subsequent tissue protection.
Finally, examination of TRPV1 + nociceptors in human intestinal biopsies revealed notable differences between healthy (non-IBD) and IBD patients. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed TRPV1 + neuronal innervation in the mucosal layer of healthy intestines, which was confirmed by co-staining with a pan-neuronal marker βIII-tubulin ( Figure 7 G, yellow arrows). TRPV1 + nociceptor innervation was significantly diminished in inflamed colon tissues isolated from IBD patients compared with healthy colon tissues (inflammation indicated by CD3ε + T cell density) ( Figures 7 G and 7H), indicating that the regulatory networks between gut-innervating TRPV1 + nociceptors and environmental signals such as the intestinal microbiota are dysregulated in human IBD. To explore the potential functional relevance of nociceptors in the context of human IBD, we analyzed expression of genes encoding nociceptor-associated neuropeptides in intestinal tissues isolated from healthy individuals versus IBD patients (Database: GEO: GSE57945 ) ( Haberman et al., 2014 44. Haberman, Y. ∙ Tickle, T.L. ∙ Dexheimer, P.J. ... Pediatric Crohn disease patients exhibit specific ileal transcriptome and microbiome signature J. Clin. Invest. 2014; 124 :3617-3633 Crossref Scopus (320) PubMed Google Scholar ). The expression of nociceptor-related genes such as TRPV1 and TAC1 ( Yissachar et al., 2017 104. Yissachar, N. ∙ Zhou, Y. ∙ Ung, L. ... An intestinal organ culture system uncovers a role for the nervous system in microbe-immune crosstalk Cell. 2017; 168 :1135-1148.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (134) PubMed Google Scholar ) was significantly altered in the intestinal biopsy samples isolated from IBD patients relative to non-IBD healthy controls ( Figures 7 I and 7J). In contrast, the expression levels of CALCA and VIP were comparable ( Figures 7 K and 7L), indicating that there is dysregulated nociceptor activity, including that mediated by SP, in the context of ongoing chronic inflammation in the human intestine.

Section: Discussion

Mammals have coevolved with their microbiota over thousands of years, providing a hospitable environmental niche and sources of nutrients for the microorganisms while the microbiota provides many advantages for the host, including nutritional and metabolic benefits and protection from infection and tissue injury ( Ansaldo et al., 2021 3.

In this study, we demonstrate that TRPV1 + nociceptors mediate tissue protection following DSS-induced intestinal damage and inflammation in part through regulating the composition of the intestinal microbiota. In the absence of TRPV1 + nociceptors, vancomycin-sensitive Gram + bacterial communities lead to enhanced susceptibility to DSS-induced colitis in mice ( Figures S7 A and S7B). Further, mono-colonization of a consortium of Gram + Clostridium spp. in GF mice with disrupted nociception was sufficient to drive exacerbated intestinal inflammation, while mono-colonization of nociceptor-sufficient GF mice with Clostridium spp. was tissue protective ( Figures S7 C and S7D). Mechanistically, TRPV1 + nociceptor-derived SP limited intestinal inflammation in a microbiota-dependent manner. These findings highlight a previously unrecognized role for TRPV1 + nociceptors in regulating the composition of the intestinal microbiota through SP, which is required for tissue protection and the restoration of intestinal homeostasis in the context of ongoing inflammation.
Previous studies identified that TRPV1 + nociceptors induce vasodilation, increasing blood flow and edema independently of the immune response through release of neuropeptides ( Brain and Williams, 1989 15. Brain, S.D. ∙ Williams, T.J. Interactions between the tachykinins and calcitonin gene-related peptide lead to the modulation of oedema formation and blood flow in rat skin Br. J.

Substance P in sensory nerve fibres contributes to the development of oedema in the rat hind paw after thermal injury Br. J. Pharmacol. 1984; 82 :217-222 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). TRPV1 + nociceptors also contribute to cutaneous skin inflammation by modulating the IL-23-IL-17 axis ( Cohen et al., 2019 24. Cohen, J.A. ∙ Edwards, T.N. ∙ Liu, A.W. ...

Silencing nociceptor neurons reduces allergic airway inflammation Neuron. 2015; 87 :341-354 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (211) PubMed Google Scholar ). In other contexts, TRPV1 + nociceptors can perform immunoregulatory functions including suppression of the recruitment and activity of neutrophils during bacterial infection that lead to increased bacterial survival in the skin and lungs ( Baral et al., 2018 7. Baral, P. ∙ Umans, B.D. ∙ Li, L. ... Nociceptor sensory neurons suppress neutrophil and gammadelta T cell responses in bacterial lung infections and lethal pneumonia Nat.

Blocking neuronal signaling to immune cells treats streptococcal invasive infection Cell. 2018; 173 :1083-1097.e22 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (174) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this report, we extend these studies to identify previously unrecognized functions for TRPV1 + nociceptors in regulating intestinal inflammation and tissue homeostasis. Therefore, TRPV1 + nociceptors can perform both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory functions in a context-dependent and tissue-specific manner.
Mechanistically, we identify a role of nociceptor-derived SP in regulating the composition of the intestinal microbiota and mediating tissue protection following acute intestinal injury. Inflammatory pain can be elicited by inflammation and intestinal dysbiosis resulting in hyperalgesia ( Guo et al., 2019a 42. Guo, R. ∙ Chen, L.H. ∙ Xing, C. ... Pain regulation by gut microbiota: molecular mechanisms and therapeutic potential Br. J. Anaesth. 2019; 123 :637-654 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this context, specific pathogenic bacteria have been shown to directly activate nociceptors and elicit pain and inflammation ( Chiu et al., 2013 20. Chiu, I.M. ∙ Heesters, B.A. ∙ Ghasemlou, N. ... Bacteria activate sensory neurons that modulate pain and inflammation Nature. 2013; 501 :52-57 Crossref Scopus (502) PubMed Google Scholar ; Pinho-Ribeiro et al., 2018 74. Pinho-Ribeiro, F.A. ∙ Baddal, B. ∙ Haarsma, R. ... Blocking neuronal signaling to immune cells treats streptococcal invasive infection Cell. 2018; 173 :1083-1097.e22 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (174) PubMed Google Scholar ). Several RORγt + Treg-cell- or Th17-cell-inducing microbes have been reported to directly modulate TRPV1 + nociceptor activity and regulate Tac1 expression in nociceptors ( Yissachar et al., 2017 104. Yissachar, N. ∙ Zhou, Y. ∙ Ung, L. ... An intestinal organ culture system uncovers a role for the nervous system in microbe-immune crosstalk Cell. 2017; 168 :1135-1148.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (134) PubMed Google Scholar ). Based on these findings, further studies will also be required to determine whether specific types of beneficial bacteria or inflammatory mediators such as IL-6 and TNF-α can modulate nociceptor activation and SP release during intestinal damage and inflammation.
SP is widely distributed throughout the nervous system and has been implicated in neuro-immune interactions during tissue injury and cutaneous type 2 inflammation ( Perner et al., 2020 73. Perner, C. ∙ Flayer, C.H. ∙ Zhu, X. ... Substance P release by sensory neurons triggers dendritic cell migration and initiates the Type-2 immune response to allergens Immunity. 2020; 53 :1063-1077.e7 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhang et al., 2019 107.

Immunol. 2019; 203 :1701-1714 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ). SP released from nociceptors also promotes the development of allergic type 2 inflammation by inducing mast cell degranulation in the skin and lung ( Cyphert et al., 2009 26. Cyphert, J.M. ∙ Kovarova, M. ∙ Allen, I.C. ... Cooperation between mast cells and neurons is essential for antigen-mediated bronchoconstriction J.

House dust mites activate nociceptor-mast cell clusters to drive type 2 skin inflammation Nat.

Lim, J.E. ∙ Chung, E. ∙ Son, Y. A neuropeptide, substance-P, directly induces tissue-repairing M2 like macrophages by activating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway even in the presence of IFNgamma Sci.

Cell Physiol. 2008; 294 :C1586-C1596 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the role of SP in intestinal inflammation has remained elusive. The findings of this study provide insights into the role of nociceptor-derived SP in regulating the intestinal microbiota and in promoting tissue protection following acute intestinal damage. Further studies will be necessary to dissect the molecular mechanisms that underlie this neuronal-microbiota crosstalk and the extent to which SP acts in parallel and/or synergy with other neurotransmitters and inflammatory mediators.
Nociceptor-derived CGRP has been shown to limit recruitment of neutrophils and γδT cells during acute bacterial infection in the skin and lung as well as SFB levels and M cell function in the ileum following experimental Salmonella infection ( Baral et al., 2018 7. Baral, P. ∙ Umans, B.D. ∙ Li, L. ... Nociceptor sensory neurons suppress neutrophil and gammadelta T cell responses in bacterial lung infections and lethal pneumonia Nat. Med. 2018; 24 :417-426 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lai et al., 2020 57. Lai, N.Y. ∙ Musser, M.A. ∙ Pinho-Ribeiro, F.A. ...

Blocking neuronal signaling to immune cells treats streptococcal invasive infection Cell. 2018; 173 :1083-1097.e22 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (174) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, we and others have previously shown that CGRP negatively regulates pulmonary type 2 immune responses during helminth infection through effects on ILC2 effector function ( Nagashima et al., 2019 68. Nagashima, H. ∙ Mahlakõiv, T. ∙ Shih, H.Y. ...

Xu, H. ∙ Ding, J. ∙ Porter, C.B.M. ... Transcriptional atlas of intestinal immune cells reveals that neuropeptide alpha-CGRP modulates Group 2 innate lymphoid cell responses Immunity. 2019; 51 :696-708.e9 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition to changes in SP levels, we detected significantly reduced levels of CGRP and goblet cell responses in the colons of mice with disrupted nociception following DSS administration, indicating a potential role of TRPV1 + nociceptor-derived CGRP in regulating goblet cells, mucus production and barrier function, which could further contribute to tissue reparative processes ( Paone and Cani, 2020 72. Paone, P. ∙ Cani, P.D. Mucus barrier, mucins and gut microbiota: the expected slimy partners? Gut. 2020; 69 :2232-2243 Crossref Scopus (240) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, it remains to be determined whether nociceptor-derived CGRP and SP act cooperatively at different stages of intestinal damage and inflammation to limit inflammation and promote tissue protection and repair.
In summary, this study identifies a previously unrecognized pathway through which gut-innervating TRPV1 + nociceptors regulate the composition of the intestinal microbiota to mediate tissue-protective processes in the context of ongoing intestinal damage and inflammation. The identification of a microbiota-dependent and immuno-modulatory role for the gut-innervating nociceptors could have implications for the development of neuromodulation-based therapies and pain management strategies for IBD and other chronic inflammatory disorders.
Although our study provides a comprehensive understanding of the role of TRPV1 + nociceptors in regulating intestinal inflammation, several limitations should be mentioned. First, our study demonstrated that Clostridium spp. are sufficient to drive TRPV1 + nociceptor-mediated tissue protection in mice with intact nociception. However, further metabolomic and transcriptomic studies are required to investigate the mechanisms underlying the regulation of Clostridium spp. by TRPV1 + nociceptors in this setting. Second, while the chemogenetic manipulation was specific to colon-innervating TRPV1 + nociceptors, future studies will be required to distinguish between DRG and vagus nerve populations. Third, for the microbiological studies we primarily adopted the approach using chemical ablation of TRPV1 + nociceptors. While we also observed significant alterations in the composition of the intestinal microbiota upon acute silencing of TRPV1 + nociceptors in the chemogenetic system following DSS administration, future studies with novel gnotobiotic and chemogenetic mouse models will be needed to address the nociceptor-microbiota crosstalk following acute neuronal manipulation. Appropriate controls for the fidelity and stability of microbial communities in the context of FMT will also be important in these studies. Finally, loss-of-function experiments related to SP were not limited to TRPV1 + nociceptors in this study and future neuronal cell-lineage-specific genetic manipulations will be required to investigate this functionally at a cell-lineage-specific level. Thus, the development of new mouse genetic tools and subsequent future studies will be necessary to investigate the interactions between the gut-innervating nociceptors, TRPV1 + nociceptor-derived SP and CGRP, and specific members of the intestinal microbiota.

De-identified intestinal biopsies from the terminal ileum and rectum of pediatric individuals with Ulcerative Colitis or controls who did not have inflammatory bowel disease were obtained following Institutional-Review-Board-approved protocol from the JRI IBD Live Cell Bank Consortium at Weill Cornell Medicine. Informed consent was obtained for all subjects. Subject baseline characteristics for these samples are listed in Tables S3 .
C57BL/6 (B6) (Jax no.000664), Trpv1 -Cre (Jax no.017769), tdTomato fl/stop/fl (Jax no.007914), hM4Di fl-stop-fl (Jax no.026219), hM3Dq fl-stop-fl (Jax no.026220) and Tac1 -/- (Jax no.004103) mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratories and bred at specific pathogen-free facilities at Weill Cornell Medicine. Taconic C57BL/6 were purchased from Taconic Biosciences. Germ-free C57BL/6J were maintained at the Weill Cornell Medicine Gnotobiotic Mouse Facility. Germ-free C57BL/6J and microbial colonized ex-GF mice were maintained in sterile isocages during all experimental procedures. All mice used were between 6 and 16 weeks old and were age- and sex-matched for each experiment, maintained on a 12 hour light–dark cycle, and provided food and water ad libitum. Male and female mice were used for experiments; no differences were observed within the parameters analyzed. Littermates of the same sex were randomly assigned to experimental groups. All protocols were approved by the Weill Cornell Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), and all experiments were performed according to the guidelines of the IACUC.
If not mentioned specifically, 2.5% colitis-grade dextran sulfate sodium salt (DSS) with average molecular weight of 36,000-50,000 Da (MP Biomedicals) was added to drinking water for 6 days, followed by drinking waters for 4 to 7 days. Mice were monitored daily for morbidity (piloerection, lethargy), weight loss and rectal bleeding. Severity of disease was scored as follows: weight loss (no change, 0; less than 5%, 1; 6-10%, 2; 11-20%, 3; more than 20%, 4); feces (normal, 0; pasty, semi-formed, 1; sticky, 2; sticky with some blood, 3; completely liquid, bloody or unable to defecate after 10min, 4), rectal bleeding (no blood, 0; visible blood in rectum, 1; visible blood on fur, 2); general appearance (normal, 0; piloerect, 1; lethargic and piloerect, 2; lethargic and hunched, 3; motionless and sickly, 4).
Ampicillin (0.5 g/L), vancomycin (0.25 g/L), metronidazole (0.5 g/L), neomycin (0.5 g/L) and gentamicin (0.5 g/L) were supplemented with 1 packet of artificial sweetener (Sweet’ N Low) per 250 ml of drinking water as previously described ( Bessman et al., 2020 11. Bessman, N.J. ∙ Mathieu, J.R.R. ∙ Renassia, C. ...

Vehicle (Sweet’ N Low only) or antibiotics were administered beginning 2 weeks prior to 2% DSS administration, and antibiotic treatment continued throughout the DSS experiment.
Germ-free B6 mice were colonized with indicated bacteria consortia by oral gavage for 2 weeks before RTX-mediated ablation of TRPV1 + nociceptors and maintained within sterile vinyl isolators at the Weill Cornell Gnotobiotic Mouse Facility. After 4 weeks of nociceptor ablation, mice were used for DSS-induced colitis experiments in the isolators with 2% DSS in drinking water.
For FMT studies, donor colon and cecum contents were collected, pooled by treatment group, weighed, re-suspended at 150 mg/ml in PBS supplemented with 10% glycerol, and frozen. Thawed fecal suspension (200 μL per mouse) was then administered to recipient germ-free B6 mice by a single oral gavage. Germ-free B6 mice were maintained within sterile vinyl isolators at the Weill Cornell Gnotobiotic Mouse Facility and monitored for germ-free status by weekly aerobic and anaerobic culturing. After FMT, recipient mice were housed in sterile cages. After 4 to 6 weeks of transplantation, mice were used for DSS-induced colitis experiments in the isolators.
To perform chemogenetic manipulation of TRPV1 + nociceptors, we bred Trpv1 -Cre homozygous mice to hM4Di fl-stop-fl mice (DREADD for inhibition) or hM3qi fl-stop-fl mice (DREADD for activation), generating TRPV1 hM4Di , TRPV1 hM3Dq or littermate control TRPV1 wt/wt mice. To perform silencing of nociceptors during DSS-induced acute colitis, TRPV1 hM4Di and littermate control TRPV1 wt/wt mice were treated with CNO (1 mg/kg) from day 0 to day 10 every other day. To perform excitation of nociceptors during DSS-induced acute colitis, TRPV1 hM3Dq and littermate control TRPV1 wt/wt mice were treated with CNO (0.1 mg/kg) from day 0 to day 6 every other day.
Resiniferatoxin (RTX), a capsaicin analogue, was injected subcutaneously into indicated mice in three escalating (30 μg/kg, 70 μg/kg, and 100 μg/kg) doses on consecutive days. Control mice were treated with vehicle solution (DMSO in PBS). Mice were allowed to rest for 4 weeks before DSS-induced acute colitis. For targeted ablation of the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) TRPV1 + nociceptors, indicated mice were injected intrathecally with RTX (50 ng/mouse) or vehicle solution (DMSO in PBS) while under isoflurane on two consecutive days in the L5-L6 region using a 30G needle and Gastight syringe (Hamilton) ( Mishra and Hoon, 2010 64. Mishra, S.K. ∙ Hoon, M.A. Ablation of TrpV1 neurons reveals their selective role in thermal pain sensation Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2010; 43 :157-163 Crossref Scopus (93) PubMed Google Scholar ). Ablation efficiency was confirmed by measurement of nociceptor markers genes in the DRG and quantification of TRPV1 + neurons in the DRG by immunofluorescence microscopy.
Mice were anesthetized with 3% isoflurane followed by 1% isoflurane to maintain anesthesia. To prevent dehydration of eyes, artificial tear was used. After shaving and sterilization of the abdomen, mice were placed on a sterile surgical pad and covered with a sterile surgical drape. The colon was exposed by making a midline incision through the abdominal wall. 2 μL of AAV9 virus (500 nL ∗ 4 sites) was injected at a flow rate of 100 nL/minute to enhance convection with a pulled glass pipette, and the needle was left in place for at least 5 minutes to prevent reflux. After injection, the abdominal wall was sutured, and skin was closed using surgical sutures. Antibiotic ointment was applied to the closed surgical site. To perform silencing of nociceptors during DSS-induced acute colitis, mice injected with AAV9 viruses were treated with CNO (1 mg/kg) from day 0 to day 10 every day. Tissues were collected for analysis at least 3 weeks after AAV injections. AAV-hSyn-DIO-mCherry and AAV-hSyn-DIO-hM4D(Gi)-mCherry viruses were a gift from Bryan Roth (Addgene plasmid # 50459; Addgene plasmid #44362) ( Krashes et al., 2011 55. Krashes, M.J. ∙ Koda, S. ∙ Ye, C. ... Rapid, reversible activation of AgRP neurons drives feeding behavior in mice J. Clin. Invest. 2011; 121 :1424-1428 Crossref Scopus (868) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Substance P was purchased from Tocris and administered intraperitoneally every other day at dose of 2 μg per mouse starting from day 0 to day 10 during DSS-induced colitis.
Metabolic analyses on DMSO- and RTX-treated mice were performed by the Metabolic Phenotyping Center at Weill Cornell Medicine. Animals were individually housed in a temperature controlled Promethion Metabolic Screening System (Sable Systems International, NV). Food and water intake and body mass were recorded continuously by gravimetric measurements within the cages. Physical activity was determined according to beam breaks within a grid of infrared sensors built into each cage. Energy expenditure was calculated using the Weir equation (Energy expenditure = 3.941 kcal/L x VO2 + 1.106 kcal/L x VCO2) ( Weir, 1949 99. Weir, J.B. New methods for calculating metabolic rate with special reference to protein metabolism J. Physiol. 1949; 109 :1-9 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Energy expenditure is displayed as the total kcal per specified periods of time, with values adjusted by ANCOVA ( Speakman, 2013 84. Speakman, J.R. Measuring energy metabolism in the mouse - theoretical, practical, and analytical considerations Front. Physiol. 2013; 4 :34 Crossref Scopus (137) PubMed Google Scholar ) for body mass or corrected body mass using VassarStats. Mice were acclimated to this environment on a 12 hour light/dark cycle for 48 hour before the 24 hour recording period began. When not analyzed in metabolic cages, food and water intake were analyzed in cages holding 4-5 mice each and averaged per mouse. Food and water intake was analyzed by daily weighing of food and water.
For measurement of total gastrointestinal transit time, mice were given an oral gavage of 6% carmine red (Sigma-Aldrich) dissolved in 0.5% methylcellulose (prepared in sterile 0.9% NaCl). Total intestinal transit time was measured as the time from oral gavage it took for mice to pass a fecal pellet that contained carmine.
For intestinal lamina propria lymphocyte preparations, colon was removed, cleaned from remaining fat and washed in ice-cold PBS. Intestinal tissue was opened longitudinally and washed in ice-cold PBS. Dissociation of epithelial cells was performed by incubation on a shaker at 37 °C in HBSS (Sigma-Aldrich) containing 1% FBS and 5 mM EDTA (Thermo Fisher Scientific) two times for 15 min. After each step, samples were vortexed, and the epithelial fraction was filtered through a 100 μm filter. Afterwards, remaining tissue was chopped into small pieces and enzymatic digestion was performed using dispase (0.4 U/ml; Thermo Fisher Scientific), collagenase type III (1.5 mg/ml; Worthington) and DNase I (20 μg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) in RPMI (Corning) containing 5% FBS for 60 min on a shaker at 37°C. Leukocytes were filtered through a 70 μm cell strainer and further enriched by a 40% Percoll (GE Healthcare) gradient centrifugation.
Mouse single-cell suspensions were incubated on ice with anti-CD16/CD32 (93) antibody (Biolegend) and the following conjugated antibodies in PBS. Dead cells were routinely excluded with Fixable Aqua Dead Cell Stain (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For surface staining, B220 (RA3-6B2), CD45 (30-F11), CD3ε (145-2C11), CD4 (RM4-5), CD5 (53-7.3), CD8α (53-6.7), CD11b (M1-70), CD11c (N418), CD127 (A7R34), CD90.2 (30-H12), FcεR1α (MAR-1), Gr1 (RB6-8C5) and TCRγ/δ (GL3), Ly6G (1A8), MHCII (I-A/I-E) (M5/114.15.2), CD64 (X54-5/7.1), SiglecF (E50-2440) and F4/80 (BM8) were used. Cytokine production was induced by stimulation of cells for 4 h at 37 °C with the presence of 50 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (Sigma), 500 ng/ml ionomycin and GolgiStop (BD Bioscience) in complete RPMI-1640 medium (containing 10% FBS, 50 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin). IL-17A (TC11-18H10.1) and IFNγ (XMG1.2) were stained using the BD Cytofix/Cytoperm and Perm/Wash solutions. GATA3 (TWAJ), FoxP3 (FJK-16S), T-bet (4B10), Helios (22F6) and RORγt (B2D) were stained using the Foxp3 transcription factor staining buffer set (Thermo Fisher Scientific). All antibodies used in flow cytometry were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific, Biolegend or BD Biosciences. Flow cytometry experiments were acquired using a custom configuration Fortessa flow cytometer and analyzed with FlowJo software (TreeStar).
Tissues were harvested in standard fashion and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 4 hours at 4 °C before washing 3 times in PBS. Tissues were then dehydrated overnight at 4 °C in 30% sucrose dissolved in PBS. Dehydrated tissues were cryoprotected in Tissue-Tek OCT compound (Sakura) and stored at -80 °C until sectioning at a thickness of 10 μm using a cryotome (Leica Instruments) and immobilization on SuperFrost Plus slides (VWR). Immobilized tissues were then stored at -20 °C until immunostaining. For mouse sections, slides were allowed to come to room temperature and excess OCT medium was washed off in PBS and tissue sections were then blocked in PBS with 5% normal goat serum, 5% normal donkey serum (both Jackson Immunoresearch) and 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 minutes. For Figures 1 A, 1B, S1 B, S1N, and S1M, tissue sections were then stained with the following primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer for 1h at room temperature: anti-βIII-tubulin-eFluor660 (2G10, eBioscience). For Figures 2 B and S1 C, tissue sections were stained with the following primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer for overnight at 4 °C: rabbit anti-phospho-p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (Thr202/Tyr204) monoclonal antibody (CST) or guinea pig anti-Capsaicin receptor antibody (Millipore). Tissue sections were then washed 3 times in PBS, incubated with secondary antibody anti-rabbit IgG Alexa555 or anti-guinea pig IgG Alexa647 (Invitrogen) for 1h at room temperature. Tissue sections were then washed 3 times in PBS, incubated with DAPI (Invitrogen) for 5 minutes prior to a final wash in PBS, and mounted with Prolong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen). Representative images were captured under an inverted Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope (Nikon).
For human sections, slides were allowed to come to room temperature and excess OCT medium was washed off in PBS and tissue sections were fixed in ice-cold acetone for 20 minutes and washed in PBS. After air dry, tissue sections were then blocked in PBS with 10% normal horse serum (Jackson Immunoresearch) and 1% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 minutes and treated with Streptavidin/Biotin blocking kit (Vector laboratories). Tissue sections were then stained with the following primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer for 1h at room temperature anti-TRPV1 (BS-1931R, Bioss) and biotinylated anti-CD3ε (OKT3, Biolegend). Sections were washed 3 times with PBS and then incubated with secondary antibodies including anti-βIII-tubulin-AF488 (2G10, eBioscience), anti-rabbit IgG-TRITC (Jackson Immunoresearch), Streptavidin IgG-AF647 (Invitrogen) in blocking buffer for 1h at room temperature. Tissue sections were then washed 3 times in PBS, incubated with DAPI (Invitrogen) for 5 minutes prior to a final wash in PBS, and mounted with Prolong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen). Representative images were captured under an inverted Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope (Nikon).
To detect mucin in intestinal tissue sections, proximal intestinal tissues were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (bioWORLD), embedded in paraffin, and 5 μm sections stained with PAS combined with Alcian Blue by IDEX BioResearch. Images were acquired using Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope (Nikon). The number of goblet cells in villus was calculated from the number of goblet cells in 20 crypts per mouse.
5 cm of distal colons were harvested from mice and homogenized by sonication in PBS on ice. After sonication, supernatants were purified by centrifugation and used for ELISA analysis. Mouse Substance P and CGRP were detected using competitive mouse substance P and CGRP ELISA kits (both from Cayman Chemical). All procedures were carried out according to manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were assayed on Softmax Pro Software in duplicates and concentrations were determined from a standard curve.
Mouse tissues including dorsal root ganglia (DRG), duodenum, jejunum, ileum, colon, mesenteric lymph nodes and lung were harvested and homogenized in Trizol (Thermo Fisher Scientific). RNA was extracted with chloroform and RNA concentration was determined using a Nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For the colon muscularis layer dissection, after euthanasia the colon was cleaned, cut open and washed in HBSS and the muscularis region was carefully dissected from the underlying mucosa (lamina propria). Each region was then homogenized, and RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (QIAGEN). Reverse transcription of total RNA was performed using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using SYBR green chemistry (Invitrogen) and primers listed in key resources table and Table S1 on a QuantStudio 6 Flex Real-Time PCR (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Gene expression was normalized as n-fold difference to the housekeeping gene Actb .
Library preparation, sequencing, and operational taxonomic unit (OTU) table generation were performed by the Microbiome Core Lab at Weill Cornell Medicine. Each fecal pellet was deposited into a Qiagen PowerBead glass 0.1 mm tube (13118-50). Using a Promega Maxwell RSC PureFood GMO and Authentication Kit (AS1600), 1 ml of CTAB buffer and 20 μl of RNase A Solution were added to the PowerBead tube containing the sample. The sample/buffer were mixed for 10 seconds on a Vortex Genie2 and then incubated at 95 °C for 5 min on an Eppendorf ThermoMixer F2.0, shaking at 1500 rpm. The tube was removed and clipped to a horizontal microtube attachment on a Vortex Genie2 (SI-H524) and vortexed at high-speed for 20 min. The sample was then removed from the Vortex and centrifuged in an Eppendorf Centrifuge 5430R at 4 °C, 12700 rpm for 10 min. Upon completion, the sample was centrifuged again for an additional 10 min to eliminate foam. The sample tube cap was removed, and the sample checked for foam and particulates. If foam or particulates were found in the sample, they were carefully removed using a P1000 pipette. The opened tube was then added to a Promega MaxPrep Liquid Handler tube rack. The Liquid Handler instrument was loaded with proteinase K tubes, lysis buffer, elution buffer, 1000 ml tips, 50 ml tips, 96-sample deep-well plate, and Promega Maxwell RSC 48 plunger tips. The Promega MaxPrep Liquid Handler instrument was programmed to use 300 μl of sample and transfer all sample lysate into a Promega Maxwell RSC 48 extraction cartridge for DNA extraction. Upon completion, the extraction cartridge was loaded into Promega Maxwell RSC 48 for DNA extraction and elution. DNA was eluted in 100 μl and transferred to a standard 96-well plate. DNA was quantified using a Quant-iT dsDNA High Sensitivity Assay Kit using a Promega GloMax plate reader on a microplate (655087).
Libraries were prepared according to the protocol of the Earth Microbiome Project ( https://earthmicrobiome.org/protocols-and-standards/16s/ ). Amplicon libraries were washed using Beckman Coulter AMPure XP magnetic beads. Library quality and size verification was performed using a PerkinElmer LabChip GXII instrument with DNA 1K Reagent Kit (CLS760673). Library concentrations were quantified using Quant-iT dsDNA High Sensitivity Assay Kit using a Promega GloMax plate reader on a microplate (655087). Library molarity was calculated based on library peak size and concentration. Libraries were normalized to 2nM using the PerkinElmer Zephyr G3 NGS Workstation (133750) and pooled together using the same volume across all normalized libraries into a 1.5 ml Eppendorf DNA tube (022431021). Pooled libraries were sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq instrument at loading concentration of 8pM with 10% PhiX, using MiSeq Reagent Kit v2, 500-cycles (MS-102-2003), producing paired 250 bp reads.
Raw reads were processed and clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using USEARCH version 11.0.667 ( Edgar, 2010 32. Edgar, R.C. Search and clustering orders of magnitude faster than BLAST Bioinformatics. 2010; 26 :2460-2461 Crossref Scopus (13467) PubMed Google Scholar ). Specifically, reads were demultiplexed and read pairs merged, with a maximum of five mismatching bases in the overlap region, as well as a minimum sequence agreement of 80%. PhiX contaminant sequences were removed, and merged sequences were filtered according to FASTQ quality scores using a maximum expected nominal error number of 1.0 per read. Filtered sequences were clustered into OTUs at a 97% identity threshold using the USEARCH cluster_otus command with default settings. Unfiltered merged reads were mapped to the OTU representative sequences, generating an OTU table. Taxonomic classification of OTU representative sequences was performed with the USEARCH SINTAX command with a confidence score of 0.8, using version 16 of the RDP 16S training set ( Cole et al., 2014 25. Cole, J.R. ∙ Wang, Q. ∙ Fish, J.A. ... Ribosomal Database Project: data and tools for high throughput rRNA analysis Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 :D633-D642 Crossref Scopus (2529) PubMed Google Scholar ). A phylogenetic tree was generated from the OTU representative sequences using the USEARCH -cluster_aggd command with default settings. Diversity estimation and principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) ordination were performed using the phyloseq R package version 1.30.0 ( McMurdie and Holmes, 2013 62. McMurdie, P.J. ∙ Holmes, S. phyloseq: an R package for reproducible interactive analysis and graphics of microbiome census data PLoS One. 2013; 8 :e61217 Crossref Scopus (7196) PubMed Google Scholar ) after subsampling the OTU table to even depth. To test for clustering of samples by genotype or treatment, the PERMANOVA test was applied using the adonis function of the vegan R package version 2.5.6.
For analysis of bacterial colonization by qPCR, fecal DNA was purified using the PowerSoil kit (Qiagen). Bacterial colonization was quantified using species-specific primers normalized to universal 16S primers which amplify all eubacteria. All primers are listed in Table S2 .
RNAseq gene expression data from a study of the ileal transcriptome in pediatric Crohn disease patients were downloaded from NCBI GEO using the accession number GSE57945 ( Haberman et al., 2014 44. Haberman, Y. ∙ Tickle, T.L. ∙ Dexheimer, P.J. ... Pediatric Crohn disease patients exhibit specific ileal transcriptome and microbiome signature J. Clin. Invest. 2014; 124 :3617-3633 Crossref Scopus (320) PubMed Google Scholar ). Specifically, expression levels measured in reads per kilobase per million reads mapped (RPKM) as well as sample metadata were downloaded using the R package GEOquery ( Davis and Meltzer, 2007 30. Davis, S. ∙ Meltzer, P.S. GEOquery: a bridge between the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and BioConductor Bioinformatics. 2007; 23 :1846-1847 Crossref Scopus (1127) PubMed Google Scholar ). Statistical tests (Kruskal-Wallis with Tukey post-hoc test for differential expression and Spearman correlation test) were performed in R.
P value of data sets was determined by unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test with 95% confidence interval. Normal distribution was assumed. If equal variances between two groups could not be assumed, Welch’s correction was performed. All statistical tests were performed with GraphPad Prism. Error bars depict the SEM.
No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. The experiments were not randomized, and the investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment. No animals were excluded from the analysis unless clearly indicated.
