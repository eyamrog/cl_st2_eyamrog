Title: Neutrophil elastase selectively kills cancer cells and attenuates tumorigenesis


Abstract: Summary

Cancer cell genetic variability and similarity to host cells have stymied development of broad anti-cancer therapeutics. Our innate immune system evolved to clear genetically diverse pathogens and limit host toxicity; however, whether/how innate immunity can produce similar effects in cancer is unknown. Here, we show that human, but not murine, neutrophils release catalytically active neutrophil elastase (ELANE) to kill many cancer cell types while sparing non-cancer cells. ELANE proteolytically liberates the CD95 death domain, which interacts with histone H1 isoforms to selectively eradicate cancer cells. ELANE attenuates primary tumor growth and produces a CD8 + T cell-mediated abscopal effect to attack distant metastases. Porcine pancreatic elastase (ELANE homolog) resists tumor-derived protease inhibitors and exhibits markedly improved therapeutic efficacy. Altogether, our studies suggest that ELANE kills genetically diverse cancer cells with minimal toxicity to non-cancer cells, raising the possibility of developing it as a broad anti-cancer therapy.

Section: Introduction

Cancer is a disease of mutations, which exhibits a high degree of spatial and temporal genetic heterogeneity ( Stratton et al., 2009 42. Stratton, M.R. ∙ Campbell, P.J. ∙ Futreal, P.A. The cancer genome Nature. 2009; 458 :719-724 Crossref Scopus (2675) PubMed Google Scholar ; Vogelstein et al., 2013 47. Vogelstein, B. ∙ Papadopoulos, N. ∙ Velculescu, V.E. ... Cancer genome landscapes Science. 2013; 339 :1546-1558 Crossref Scopus (5817) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition to overcoming this heterogeneity, eradicating cancer cells while sparing non-cancer cells remains a formidable task. For these reasons, identifying agents that couple broad efficacy across cancer types while maintaining specificity to limit host toxicity has been challenging.
Broad efficacy and specificity are integral properties of innate immunity. Our innate immune system protects against a wide range of infectious pathogens including bacteria, fungi, and protozoa, whose genetic variability far exceeds cancer. As critical effectors of innate immunity, neutrophils eliminate genetically diverse pathogens and may be ideally poised to perform a comparable function in cancer. Indeed, human blood polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) can kill cancer cells ( Sagiv et al., 2015 37. Sagiv, J.Y. ∙ Michaeli, J. ∙ Assi, S. ... Phenotypic diversity and plasticity in circulating neutrophil subpopulations in cancer Cell Rep. 2015; 10 :562-573 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (587) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yan et al., 2014 51. Yan, J. ∙ Kloecker, G. ∙ Fleming, C. ... Human polymorphonuclear neutrophils specifically recognize and kill cancerous cells OncoImmunology. 2014; 3 :e950163 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) and their therapeutic potential is being explored in clinical trials. Despite the emerging focus on PMNs, the mechanisms by which they kill cancer cells are incompletely understood.
In contrast to the anti-cancer function of PMNs, many studies showed that neutrophils can also promote tumorigenesis. This conflict could be due to species differences in neutrophil function and/or their tissue source and activation status, all of which can produce striking functional differences ( Coffelt et al., 2016 8.

For instance, murine studies suggest that tumor cells “hijack neutrophils” to release molecules to facilitate metastatic spread ( Coffelt et al., 2015 7. Coffelt, S.B. ∙ Kersten, K. ∙ Doornebal, C.W. ...

Increased tumor-associated neutrophil accumulation is a poor prognostic marker in many cancers ( Coffelt et al., 2016 8. Coffelt, S.B. ∙ Wellenstein, M.D. ∙ de Visser, K.E.

Considering the complex roles neutrophils play in cancer, we sought to identify anti-cancer factor(s) in PMNs from healthy donors, understand their regulation across human and murine neutrophils of different sources, and explore their therapeutic potential. Our studies identified neutrophil elastase (ELANE) and its porcine homolog, porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE), as powerful anti-cancer proteins that combine broad efficacy across many cancer types with specificity to limit host toxicity. They further revealed a fundamental difference between human and murine neutrophils in mobilizing this ELANE-mediated anti-cancer pathway, which has important implications for translating mechanistic insights from mice to humans.

Section: Results

Human PMNs have a short half-life in vivo (∼8 h) and undergo apoptosis to release potent anti-microbial factors ( Dancey et al., 1976 10. Dancey, J.T. ∙ Deubelbeiss, K.A. ∙ Harker, L.A. ... Neutrophil kinetics in man J. Clin. Invest. 1976; 58 :705-715 Crossref Scopus (433) PubMed Google Scholar ; Nathan, 2006 31. Nathan, C. Neutrophils and immunity: challenges and opportunities Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 6 :173-182 Crossref Scopus (2268) PubMed Google Scholar ). To determine if these factors also kill cancer cells, we treated 35 different human or murine cancer cells with serum-free media conditioned by apoptotic PMNs (PMN media) ( Figures S1 A and S1B). PMN media effectively killed all 35 cancer cells tested via apoptosis ( Figures 1 A, 1B, and S1 C). In contrast, PMN media was not toxic to all non-cancer cells tested ( Figure 1 A). Cancer cell killing by PMN media was inhibited by serum, but serum could not rescue cancer cells if delivered after exposure to PMN media under serum-free conditions ( Figures S1 D and S1E), suggesting the presence of an inhibitor.
We further determined if PMN media induced cancer cell apoptosis in vivo . Because serum antagonized PMN media, we injected it intratumorally into syngeneic E0771 (triple-negative breast cancer [TNBC]), LLC1 (lung cancer), and B16F10 tumors (melanoma) or TNBC patient-derived xenograft (PDX)-4195 tumors. PMN media attenuated tumor growth and induced cancer cell apoptosis in every model tested ( Figures 1 C and S1 ). In contrast, PMN media injected into mammary fat of tumor-free C57BL/6 mice (control for TNBC studies) did not induce apoptosis or reduce fat mass at the injection site ( Figure 1 D). Thus, PMN media contains factor(s) that selectively kill cancer cells in vitro and in vivo .
To determine if this anti-cancer function was a general property of neutrophils, we purified human and murine neutrophils from a variety of different sources ( Figures S1 I–S1K). Human sources included PMNs from healthy donors, omental adipose tissue neutrophils (ONs) from non-cancer patients, tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) from ovarian cancer patients with metastatic tumors, and ONs from omental adipose tissue (primary metastatic site) of pre-metastatic ovarian cancer patients, whose levels were elevated prior to metastatic dissemination ( Figure 1 E; Table S1 ) ( Lee et al., 2019 27. Lee, W. ∙ Ko, S.Y. ∙ Mohamed, M.S. ... Neutrophils facilitate ovarian cancer premetastatic niche formation in the omentum J. Exp. Med. 2019; 216 :176-194 Crossref Scopus (281) PubMed Google Scholar ; Peinado et al., 2017 34. Peinado, H. ∙ Zhang, H. ∙ Matei, I.R. ... Pre-metastatic niches: organ-specific homes for metastases Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2017; 17 :302-317 Crossref Scopus (1263) PubMed Google Scholar ). Murine sources included bone marrow-derived neutrophils (BMDNs) with and without activation with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA), peritoneal neutrophils (PNs) 7 h-post thioglycolate injection, TANs from E0771 tumors, and pre-metastatic lung neutrophils (LNs) from MMTV-PyMT mice, which accumulate ( Figure 1 E) and facilitate metastasis ( Wculek and Malanchi, 2015 48. Wculek, S.K. ∙ Malanchi, I. Neutrophils support lung colonization of metastasis-initiating breast cancer cells Nature. 2015; 528 :413-417 Crossref Scopus (756) PubMed Google Scholar ).
All human neutrophil conditioned media tested killed human MDA-MB-231 and murine E0771 cancer cells. However, none of the murine neutrophil-conditioned media tested had this capability ( Figure 1 E). Furthermore, unlike human PMN media, intratumorally injected murine BMDN media failed to attenuate E0771 tumor growth in vivo ( Figure 1 F).
Our findings indicate that human neutrophils release factor(s) that selectively kill a wide range of cancer cells, but this property is absent in murine neutrophils. To identify anti-cancer factor(s) in human PMN media, we developed a quantitative killing assay to track bioactive factors ( Figure S1 L). Boiling, dialysis, and size exclusion experiments prompted us to search for proteins ( Figure S1 M). Next, we sought to purify the proteins responsible. PMN media was prepared for fractionation by clarification through a 0.22-μm filter. Surprisingly, filtration eliminated cancer killing by PMN media from 2 donors without lowering total protein ( Figure 2 A), suggesting a selective depletion of the bioactive proteins.
Shotgun proteomics analysis of PMN media revealed that only 2 of 890 detected proteins were significantly lowered by filtration in both donors (Bonferroni corrected p < 0.05): neutrophil elastase (ELANE) and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) ( Figures 2 B and S2 A; Table S2 ). ELANE is a serine protease thought to promote tumorigenesis ( Houghton et al., 2010 18. Houghton, A.M. ∙ Rzymkiewicz, D.M. ∙ Ji, H. ... Neutrophil elastase-mediated degradation of IRS-1 accelerates lung tumor growth Nat. Med. 2010; 16 :219-223 Crossref Scopus (576) PubMed Google Scholar ), whereas ECP is a pore-forming protein that kills both cancer and non-cancer cells ( Young et al., 1986 52. Young, J.D. ∙ Peterson, C.G. ∙ Venge, P. ... Mechanism of membrane damage mediated by human eosinophil cationic protein Nature. 1986; 321 :613-616 Crossref Scopus (371) PubMed Google Scholar ). Interestingly, T cells kill a wide range of cancer cells through the concerted efforts of a serine protease (granzyme B) and a pore-forming protein (perforin) ( Catalfamo and Henkart, 2003 3. Catalfamo, M. ∙ Henkart, P.A. Perforin and the granule exocytosis cytotoxicity pathway Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2003; 15 :522-527 Crossref Scopus (134) PubMed Google Scholar ), raising the possibility that neutrophils might implement a similar mechanism.
Two approaches were used to determine if ELANE and/or ECP are responsible for cancer cell killing by PMN media. First, we immuno-depleted ELANE or ECP from PMN media and found that depleting either protein attenuated MDA-MB-231 cell killing ( Figure 2 C). Second, we tested whether purified ELANE or ECP could selectively kill cancer cells. ELANE killed MDA-MB-231 cells in a dose-dependent manner without affecting human monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDMs), whereas ECP was toxic to both cell types ( Figure 2 D).
Next, we treated MDA-MB-231 cells with concentrations of ELANE (0.25 μg/mL) and ECP (0.05 μg/mL) present in PMN media. Although PMN media levels of ECP did not kill MDA-MB-231 cells alone, they significantly enhanced ELANE-mediated killing ( Figure 2 E), suggesting a synergy between these proteins.
Because ELANE influences biological pathways by proteolysis ( Pham, 2006 35. Pham, C.T.N. Neutrophil serine proteases: specific regulators of inflammation Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 6 :541-550 Crossref Scopus (820) PubMed Google Scholar ), we hypothesized that its anti-cancer function requires catalytic activity, which ECP might enhance to support synergistic killing. We inactivated ELANE with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) or alpha-1-anti-trypsin (A1AT) and found that catalytically inactive ELANE could not kill MDA-MB-231 cells ( Figure 2 F). Furthermore, inhibiting ELANE activity in PMN media with PMSF or A1AT eliminated the ability of PMN media to kill cancer cells in vitro and in vivo ( Figures 2 F and 2G). These results indicate that ELANE is the major anti-cancer protein in PMN media. Indeed, ELANE activity in PMN media was strongly correlated with MDA-MB-231 cell killing across nine healthy donors ( Figure 2 H).
We further determined if ECP could enhance ELANE’s enzymatic activity. Results showed that ECP is a type II allosteric activator of ELANE, wherein ECP binds ELANE with high affinity (K D = 17 nM) and increases its catalytic turnover (k cat ) by ∼12-fold ( Figures S2 B–S2E). Co-immunoprecipitation (coIP) experiments showed that ECP binds ELANE in human PMN media ( Figure S2 E). These results appear to explain why immunodepleting ECP (and ELANE by association) attenuated cancer cell killing even though PMN media levels of ECP were not toxic to cancer cells. Moreover, because ECP has a high affinity for biological membranes ( Torrent et al., 2008 45. Torrent, M. ∙ Navarro, S. ∙ Moussaoui, M. ... Eosinophil cationic protein high-affinity binding to bacteria-wall lipopolysaccharides and peptidoglycans Biochemistry. 2008; 47 :3544-3555 Crossref Scopus (107) PubMed Google Scholar ), these findings may also help to explain why filtration through a 0.22-μm filter selectively depleted ECP (and ELANE by association) from PMN media.
Moving forward, we focused on ELANE because it is both effective and safe in vitro , and ECP’s ability to enhance its catalytic activity could be mimicked by raising the concentration of ELANE. Indeed, higher doses of ELANE (3 μg/mL) effectively killed all cancer cells tested but were not toxic to all non-cancer cells tested ( Figures 2 I and S2 F).
Having identified ELANE as the predominant anti-cancer protein in human PMN media, we explored if differences in ELANE biology between human and murine neutrophils could explain their discrepant cancer cell killing. We first confirmed that murine ELANE (mELANE) could selectively kill human and murine cancer cells ( Figure 3 A), ruling out the idea that species differences in amino acid sequence and/or protein structure were responsible.
Next, we determined if murine neutrophils release mELANE in a catalytically active form, which is required for cancer cell killing. Whereas ELANE activity was detectable in human neutrophil media (PMNs and ONs), it was undetectable in murine neutrophil media (BMDNs, PNs, LNs, TANs, and pre-metastatic LNs), including BMDNs treated with PMA, which activates neutrophils and induces degranulation ( Figures 3 B and 3C). Our inability to detect mELANE activity in murine neutrophil media was surprising given that mELANE protein was present in the media ( Figure 3 B), and mELANE activity was detectable in cell lysates from all murine neutrophils tested ( Figure 3 C).
We reasoned that murine neutrophils might co-release an inhibitor into media that is absent in their human counterparts. To explore this, we performed shotgun proteomics analysis of murine PN and human PMN media. These studies identified 5 serine protease inhibitors ( Figure 3 D; Table S3 ). Secretory leukocyte peptidase inhibitor (SLPI) was the only inhibitor exclusively detected in murine PN media and immunoblotting validated this finding ( Figures 3 D and 3E). CoIP studies further showed that SLPI was bound to mELANE in murine PN media ( Figure 3 F), suggesting that SLPI may be responsible for inhibiting extracellular mELANE activity. Indeed, mELANE activity and cancer cell killing were detectable in Slpi- deficient PN media, and both of these effects were blocked by treatment with PMSF or with Elane −/− ( Figure 3 G).
We further investigated if deleting Slpi would equip neutrophils with the ability to oppose tumor development in vivo . To test this, we injected B16F10 cells intravenously (i.v.) and monitored lung tumor colonization. Lung tumor colonization was attenuated in whole animal Slpi −/− mice ( Figure 3 H). Depleting neutrophils increased the number of lung tumors in Slpi −/− mice but not in Slpi +/+ mice ( Figures 3 I and 3J). Eliminating Slpi selectively in myeloid cells (via bone marrow transplantation) was sufficient to lessen lung tumor colonization and phenocopy the whole animal Slpi −/− phenotype ( Figures 3 K and 3L). Together, these data suggest that “humanizing” murine neutrophils (by deleting Slpi ) restores extracellular ELANE activity and its associated anti-cancer function.
To investigate how ELANE kills cancer cells, we studied its effects on signaling pathways linked to survival/apoptosis in cancer and non-cancer cells. ELANE induced a complex killing program in all murine and human cancer cells tested, but not in any non-cancer cells tested. This program was characterized by suppression of survival pathways (decreased phosphorylation of ERK, JNK, and nuclear factor κB [NF-κB]), induction of DNA damage (increased γH2AX), elevated mitochondrial ROS production, and activation of effectors of apoptosis (increased cleaved PARP and CASP3) ( Figures 4 A and S3 ). Previous studies showed that lowering CD95 with short hairpin (shRNA) mimicked ELANE’s complex killing program resulting in selective cancer cell killing ( Chen et al., 2010 6. Chen, L. ∙ Park, S.-M. ∙ Tumanov, A.V. ... CD95 promotes tumour growth Nature. 2010; 465 :492-496 Crossref Scopus (314) PubMed Google Scholar ). We therefore investigated the role CD95 in ELANE-mediated killing.
To begin, we determined if ELANE cleaves CD95 in cancer cells. We treated cancer cells with ELANE and observed lower molecular weight CD95 bands ( Figure 4 B). To identify cleavage sites in human CD95, we incubated ELANE with recombinant proteins corresponding to its N-terminal (amino acid [aa] 1–173) or C-terminal (aa 157–335) domains. ELANE preferentially cleaved the C-terminal domain ( Figure 4 C). Mass spectrometry identified two major cleavage sites in human CD95, site 1: V 220 -A 221 , site 2: I 331 -Q 332 , both of which mapped well to ELANE’s sequence specificity ( https://www.ebi.ac.uk/merops ) ( Figures 4 D, 4E and S4 A). Cleavage at both sites was further confirmed by incubating ELANE with synthetic peptides corresponding to aa 214–231 and aa 317–335 of human CD95 and monitoring degradation products by mass spectrometry ( Figure S4 B). Analysis of murine CD95 revealed the presence of analogous ELANE cleavage sites at comparable positions in the primary sequence ( Figure S4 C). Thus, ELANE cleavage of human CD95 liberates a C-terminal fragment containing its death domain (DD).
We reasoned that cancer cell killing by ELANE is dependent on CD95 and liberation of its DD. Three approaches were used to test this idea. First, because CD95 DD is intracellular, we determined if ELANE uptake is required for killing. Treatment with Dynasore (a broad endocytosis inhibitor) or small interfering RNA (siRNA) for neuropilin 1 (NRP1), the receptor that mediates ELANE uptake by cancer cells ( Mittendorf et al., 2012 30. Mittendorf, E.A. ∙ Alatrash, G. ∙ Qiao, N. ... Breast cancer cell uptake of the inflammatory mediator neutrophil elastase triggers an anticancer adaptive immune response Cancer Res. 2012; 72 :3153-3162 Crossref Scopus (72) PubMed Google Scholar ), attenuated ELANE uptake, and protected cancer cells from ELANE ( Figures 4 F and S4 D–S4F).
Second, we tested if altering CD95 levels could modulate the efficacy of ELANE-mediated killing. Overexpressing CD95 in human or murine cancer cells accelerated ELANE-mediated killing ( Figures 4 G and S4 G–S4I), perhaps by providing more substrate for the reaction. This effect was specific to cancer cells because overexpressing CD95 in non-cancer cells did not render these cells susceptible to ELANE ( Figures 4 G and S4 G–S4I). Knocking down human CD95 in cancer cells with CRISPR protected them from ELANE-mediated killing ( Figures 4 H and 4I).
Third, we investigated if the human CD95 DD-containing fragment generated by ELANE proteolysis (DD ELANE : aa 221–331) was sufficient to selectively kill cancer cells. We expressed DD ELANE in human cancer cells and found that it killed them through an identical killing program as ELANE ( Figures 4 J, 4K, and S5 ). In contrast, expressing full-length human CD95 (FL-CD95) or an N-terminal domain lacking the DD (aa 1–209, N-CD95) had no effect on cancer cell survival ( Figures 4 J and S4 G–S4I). Importantly, DD ELANE was not toxic to all non-cancer cells tested, despite a similar level of overexpression ( Figures 4 J, 4K, S5 A, and S5B).
The toxicity of DD ELANE to cancer cells could be mediated by special properties conferred by ELANE cleavage or simply by its liberation from the full-length protein and membrane. To differentiate between these possibilities, we expressed a C-terminal human CD95 construct with an additional 9 aa flanking site 1 and 4 aa flanking site 2 (C-CD95, aa 212–335). This construct liberates the DD from CD95 and excludes the transmembrane domain (aa 174–190) but retains both ELANE cleavage sites. Although C-CD95 was unable to kill cancer cells in the absence of ELANE ( Figure 4 J), it accelerated ELANE-mediated killing—a result that mimicked overexpression of full-length CD95. This effect was specific because human C-CD95 did not lead to ELANE-mediated toxicity to non-cancer cells ( Figures 4 G and S4 G–S4I).
Our findings support a model wherein internalized ELANE cleaves CD95 to release DD ELANE , which suppresses survival pathways, activates pro-apoptotic pathways, and selectively eliminates cancer cells. What is the molecular basis for ELANE’s selective toxicity to cancer cells? NRP1 (ELANE receptor) and CD95 (ELANE substrate) are comparably expressed by cancer and non-cancer cells ( https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg/research/structural-genomics/tcga ). DD ELANE (ELANE product) kills cancer but not non-cancer cells. These findings suggest that the basis for selectivity lies downstream of ELANE uptake, substrate availability, and product generation. We reasoned that cancer cells express factor(s) that interact with DD ELANE to drive apoptosis, and these factor(s) are absent or minimally expressed by non-cancer cells.
To explore this idea, we expressed FLAG-tagged DD ELANE in cancer cells and non-cancer cells and performed immunoprecipitation liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (IP-LC-MS/MS) to identify potential binding partners. We incorporated a FLAG tag because it allowed us to identify DD ELANE -binding proteins without contamination from full-length CD95 and because introducing a FLAG-tag did not alter selective cancer cell killing by DD ELANE ( Figure 5 A). IP-LC-MS/MS identified four histone H1 isoforms (H1.0, H1.2, H1.4, and H1.5) that bound DD ELANE in cancer but not non-cancer cells ( Figure 5 B; Table S4 ).
Previous studies showed that DNA damage induces histone H1 translocation from the nucleus to the mitochondria, leading to cytochrome c release and apoptosis of cancer cells ( Konishi et al., 2003 22. Konishi, A. ∙ Shimizu, S. ∙ Hirota, J. ... Involvement of histone H1.2 in apoptosis induced by DNA double-strand breaks Cell. 2003; 114 :673-688 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (292) PubMed Google Scholar ). Given that ELANE induces DNA damage and mitochondrial dysfunction, and histone H1 isoforms were identified as DD ELANE -binding proteins, we studied the dynamics and importance of histone H1. Treating MDA-MB-231 cells with ELANE caused rapid histone H1.0 translocation from the nucleus ( Figures 5 C and S3 C). However, this translocation was not observed in MCF10A cells ( Figure 5 C). Proximity ligation assays (PLA) using anti-C-terminal CD95 and anti-H1.0 antibodies further showed that ELANE triggered CD95-H1.0 interactions in MDA-MB-231 cells but not in MCF10A cells ( Figures 5 D–5F). Interestingly, many of the PLA signals in MDA-MB-231 cells co-localized with mitochondria ( Figures 5 D–5F), which may help to explain the mitochondrial ROS induced by ELANE.
Western blot analysis revealed that histone H1 isoforms are generally elevated in cancer versus non-cancer cells. H1.2 was upregulated across all cancer cell types tested, whereas H1.0 (MDA-MB-231), H1.4 (A549), and H1.5 (MEL888) were elevated in specific cancer cell types ( Figure 5 G). These findings, which are in general agreement with previous studies ( Sato et al., 2012 38. Sato, S. ∙ Takahashi, S. ∙ Asamoto, M. ... Histone H1 expression in human prostate cancer tissues and cell lines Pathol. Int. 2012; 62 :84-92 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ; Scaffidi, 2016 39. Scaffidi, P. Histone H1 alterations in cancer Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2016; 1859 :533-539 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggest that differential histone H1 expression might underlie ELANE’s selective toxicity to cancer cells. We explored this possibility using two approaches. First, we knocked down histone H1.0 or H1.2 using siRNA and found that lowering H1 levels protected MDA-MB-231 cells from ELANE-mediated killing ( Figure 5 H). Second, we treated MCF10A cells with exogenous recombinant H1.0, which was internalized and primarily localized in the cytosol ( Figure 5 I). Although H1.0 failed to kill MCF10A cells on its own, it made them susceptible to ELANE-mediated killing, albeit with lower efficacy than in cancer cells ( Figure 5 I). Together, these findings suggest that differential expression of histone H1 isoforms contributes to ELANE’s selective toxicity to cancer cells.
To determine if ELANE selectively kills cancer cells and attenuates tumor growth in vivo , we injected it at various doses into E0771 tumors (TNBC). ELANE inhibited tumor growth at all doses tested, and its therapeutic benefit was eliminated with PMSF inactivation ( Figure 6 A). Importantly, injecting ELANE (12 μg/day, 5 days) into mammary fat of tumor-free C57BL/6 mice (TNBC control) did not induce apoptosis or lower fat mass at the injection site nor did it affect liver function ( Figure 6 B).
We next explored the therapeutic potential of intratumorally delivered ELANE in syngeneic, xenograft, and PDX models of TNBC (E0771, MDA-MB-231, PDX-M1, and PDX-4195), lung cancer (LLC1, A549), and melanoma (B16F10 and MEL888). ELANE attenuated tumor growth in all models tested ( Figure 6 D). Immunohistochemistry showed an increase in TUNEL, cPARP, and cCASP3 staining in all ELANE-treated tumors ( Figure 6 E), suggesting that ELANE’s anti-cancer action was on-target.
Notably, ELANE therapy produced a curious “tumor crater” in ∼40% of mice across all immunocompetent models tested ( Figure S6 O). Craters were not observed in tumor-free C57BL/6 mice or in tumor-bearing immunocompromised mice ( Figure S6 O). These data suggest that ELANE-mediated cancer cell killing combined with a functional adaptive immune response create a crater in the tumor. However, mechanisms underlying crater development and its importance for therapeutic efficacy require further investigation.
Because ELANE kills cancer cells but not immune cells, we hypothesized that this selective killing might liberate antigens to increase/activate immune cells in vivo . Indeed, previous studies showed that ELANE uptake by breast cancer cells enhances antigen presentation to activate cytotoxic T cells ( Chawla et al., 2016 5. Chawla, A. ∙ Alatrash, G. ∙ Philips, A.V. ... Neutrophil elastase enhances antigen presentation by upregulating human leukocyte antigen class I expression on tumor cells Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 2016; 65 :741-751 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kerros et al., 2017 20. Kerros, C. ∙ Tripathi, S.C. ∙ Zha, D. ... Neuropilin-1 mediates neutrophil elastase uptake and cross-presentation in breast cancer cells J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292 :10295-10305 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ). To test this, we delivered ELANE intratumorally in two immunocompetent syngeneic mouse models. We observed increased tumor dendritic cells (DCs), CD8 + T cells, and CD8 + T effector cells (CD8 + T eff ) following ELANE treatment in both models ( Figures S6 A and S6D). Immune cells were not increased when ELANE was injected into mammary fat of tumor-free mice ( Figures 6 C and S6 B) or into contralateral mammary fat (i.e., opposite the tumor) of E0771 tumor-bearing mice ( Figures 6 C and 6E), where it failed to attenuate tumorigenesis ( Figures S6 K and S6L). Thus, the immune cell induction was not due to an immune reaction to human ELANE.
Next, we investigated if treating a primary tumor with ELANE could decrease tumorigenesis at distant sites through CD8 + T cells, a property referred to as the abscopal effect ( Ngwa et al., 2018 32. Ngwa, W. ∙ Irabor, O.C. ∙ Schoenfeld, J.D. ... Using immunotherapy to boost the abscopal effect Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2018; 18 :313-322 Crossref Scopus (829) PubMed Google Scholar ). We tested this in two syngeneic models: (1) a TNBC model in which E0771 cells were injected into the left (1° tumor) and right (2° tumor) mammary fat pads, and (2) a melanoma model in which B16F10 cells were injected into the flank (1° tumor) and intravenously to create 2° lung tumors. In both models, we treated the 1° tumor with ELANE once/day for 5 days and measured tumor growth at both sites.
Treating the 1° tumor with ELANE attenuated tumor growth at the injected and distant sites in both models ( Figures S6 G–S6J). This effect was not due to ELANE spillover from the 1° tumor because injecting ELANE into contralateral mammary fat (i.e., opposite the tumor) failed to diminish E0771 tumor growth ( Figures S6 K and S6L). This abscopal effect was also specific since tumor growth in a genetically distinct 2° B16F10 tumor was unaffected by treatment of a 1° E0771 tumor with ELANE ( Figures S6 M and S6N). To examine the dependence of this abscopal effect on CD8 + T cells, we repeated this experiment in mice where CD8 + T cells were depleted prior to and following ELANE treatment. Results showed that depleting CD8 + T cells attenuated ELANE’s abscopal effect in both models ( Figures S6 F–S6J).
We further investigated if ELANE could induce a CD8 + T cell-mediated abscopal effect in a genetically engineered mouse (GEM) model, where tumors spontaneously and independent arise at multiple sites. We used the C3(1)-TAg GEM model of TNBC that shares many features with human TNBC patients ( Green et al., 2000 17. Green, J.E. ∙ Shibata, M.A. ∙ Yoshidome, K. ... The C3(1)/SV40 T-antigen transgenic mouse model of mammary cancer: ductal epithelial cell targeting with multistage progression to carcinoma Oncogene. 2000; 19 :1020-1027 Crossref Scopus (220) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We injected the first palpable tumor with ELANE (12 μg/day, 5 days) and monitored effects on injected and non-injected tumors until ∼24 weeks of age. Consistent with our findings in syngeneic models, ELANE attenuated tumor growth, induced cancer cell apoptosis, and increased total and effector CD8 + T cells in injected tumors ( Figures 6 F–6H). Moreover, ELANE decreased both the number and total weight of non-injected tumors ( Figure 6 H), and depleting CD8 + T cells eliminated this abscopal effect ( Figure 6 I). Collectively, these findings demonstrate that ELANE induces a CD8 + T cell-mediated abscopal effect in multiple immunocompetent models.
Although ELANE reduced tumor growth in all pre-clinical models tested, it’s efficacy in vivo was limited in comparison to its strong potency in vitro . We sought to understand the molecular basis of this discrepancy. Given that ELANE’s anti-cancer function requires catalytic activity and cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) secrete serine protease inhibitors ( Chang et al., 2012 4. Chang, Y.-H. ∙ Lee, S.-H. ∙ Liao, I.-C. ... Secretomic analysis identifies alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT) as a required protein in cancer cell migration, invasion, and pericellular fibronectin assembly for facilitating lung colonization of lung adenocarcinoma cells Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2012; 11 :1320-1339 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ; Dudani et al., 2018 11. Dudani, J.S. ∙ Warren, A.D. ∙ Bhatia, S.N. Harnessing protease activity to improve cancer care Annu. Rev. Cancer Biol. 2018; 2 :353-376 Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar ), we tested the possibility that serine protease inhibitors in the TME limit ELANE’s efficacy in vivo . We collected tumor-conditioned media (TCM) from E0771 tumors in organ culture and identified several serine protease inhibitors including alpha-1-antitrypsin (A1AT), secretory leukocyte peptidase inhibitor (SLPI), and serpin family B member 1 (SERPINB1) ( Figure 7 A). TCM potently antagonized ELANE’s catalytic activity and cancer cell killing capability in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure S7 A), and similar findings were obtained with purified A1AT ( Figure 7 B). These findings suggest that serine protease inhibitors in the TME might serve as a barrier to ELANE’s anti-tumor action.
Previous studies showed that porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE), an ELANE homolog with ∼32% amino acid identity, has a differential susceptibility to inhibition despite a similar protein structure and primary substrate specificity ( Bode et al., 1989 2. Bode, W. ∙ Meyer, Jr., E. ∙ Powers, J.C. Human leukocyte and porcine pancreatic elastase: X-ray crystal structures, mechanism, substrate specificity, and mechanism-based inhibitors Biochemistry. 1989; 28 :1951-1963 Crossref Scopus (410) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kraunsoe et al., 1996 24. Kraunsoe, J.A. ∙ Claridge, T.D. ∙ Lowe, G. Inhibition of human leukocyte and porcine pancreatic elastase by homologues of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor Biochemistry. 1996; 35 :9090-9096 Crossref Scopus (161) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ortwerth et al., 1994 33. Ortwerth, B.J. ∙ Sharma, K.K. ∙ Olesen, P.R. A comparison of the inhibition of porcine pancreatic elastase and human neutrophil elastase by alpha-crystallin Curr. Eye Res. 1994; 13 :561-567 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ). We reasoned that PPE might be less susceptible to serine protease inhibition, which in turn, would increase its therapeutic efficacy. Similar to ELANE, PPE preferentially cleaved the C-terminal CD95 domain with a comparable degradation pattern ( Figure 7 C) and selectively killed cancer cells ( Figure 7 D). In the presence of TCM or A1AT, PPE showed significantly improved cancer cell killing that associated with resistance to serine protease inhibition of its catalytic activity ( Figures 7 B and S7 A).
We further determined if PPE had improved therapeutic efficacy in vivo . To begin, we injected ELANE and PPE (standardized by units of activity) into E0771 tumors and found that PPE had improved efficacy despite a similar ability to kill E0771 cells in vitro in the absence of serine protease inhibitors ( Figures 7 E and 7F). Injecting PPE into mammary fat of tumor-free C57BL/6 mice (TNBC control) did not induce apoptosis or lower fat mass at the injection site, nor did it affect body weight, spleen weight, or liver function ( Figures S7 B–S7E).
Because PPE immediately lowered tumor volume after the first injection, we limited therapeutic dosing to 1 injection/day for 2 days. We explored PPE’s efficacy in the 1° tumor and at distant sites in the B16F10 model with lung colonization and the C3(1)-TAg GEM model. Results showed that 2 intratumoral injections of PPE into the 1° tumor had markedly improved potency in the 1° tumor and in lessening distant tumors in both models ( Figures 7 G–7J). Similar to what we observed with ELANE, depleting CD8 + T cells, eliminated PPE’s abscopal effect in the C3(1)-TAg model ( Figures 7 K and 7L). Thus, by conferring protection from serine protease inhibitors, PPE improves on the therapeutic efficacy of ELANE.

Section: Discussion

Given that human PMNs release extracellular factors that kill a wide range of pathogens, we sought to explore whether these factors have a similar ability to kill cancer cells. Using this strategy, we (1) identified ELANE as the major anti-cancer protein released by human PMNs, (2) uncovered differences between human and murine neutrophils in releasing catalytically active ELANE extracellularly, (3) deciphered that its mechanism of action involves cleaving CD95 at V 220 /A 221 and I 331 /Q 332 to liberate a DD-containing proteolytic fragment that interacts with histone H1 isoforms to selectively kill cancer cells, (4) demonstrated ELANE’s broad anti-cancer efficacy and selectivity in multiple pre-clinical models, and (5) showed that PPE, an ELANE homolog that is less sensitive to serine protease inhibitors, has markedly improved therapeutic efficacy.
On a molecular level, we show that ELANE’s therapeutic properties stem from its ability to proteolytically liberate the CD95 death domain-containing fragment (DD ELANE ), which our studies show is sufficient to kill cancer cells through a gain-of-function mechanism. This gain-of-function is not simply due to liberating the DD from full-length CD95 because expressing a C-terminal DD-containing construct with 9 aa flanking cleavage site 1 and 4 aa flanking cleavage site 2 could only accelerate ELANE-mediated killing and could not kill cancer cells on its own. We speculate that these 13 aa contain inhibitory sequences and/or alter the conformation of the DD to prevent cancer cell apoptosis and therefore require removal by ELANE. Previous studies support this model. For example, the CD95 DD adopts a closed conformation that prohibits binding of pro-apoptotic factors and self-elimination. An I313D mutation in CD95 opens its DD conformation to enable binding to pro-apoptotic factors resulting in cancer cell death in the presence and absence of external triggers ( Scott et al., 2009 40. Scott, F.L. ∙ Stec, B. ∙ Pop, C. ... The Fas-FADD death domain complex structure unravels signalling by receptor clustering Nature. 2009; 457 :1019-1022 Crossref Scopus (313) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, deleting three amino acids from the C terminus of CD95 (that closely mimics ELANE cleavage at site 2) abrogates its interaction with the anti-apoptotic factor PTPL1 and sensitizes cancer cells to apoptosis ( Ungefroren et al., 2001 46. Ungefroren, H. ∙ Kruse, M.L. ∙ Trauzold, A. ... FAP-1 in pancreatic cancer cells: functional and mechanistic studies on its inhibitory role in CD95-mediated apoptosis J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114 :2735-2746 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ).
A major outstanding question is what forms the molecular basis for ELANE’s selective toxicity to cancer cells? We provide evidence that this selectivity is due in part to the interaction of DD ELANE with histone H1 isoforms. Previous studies showed that in response to DNA damage, histone H1 translocates from the nucleus to the mitochondria, resulting in mitochondrial damage and apoptosis of cancer cells ( Yan and Shi, 2003 50. Yan, N. ∙ Shi, Y. Histone H1.2 as a trigger for apoptosis Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10 :983-985 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistent with this study, we showed that ELANE induces DNA damage in cancer cells, and H1.0 translocates into the cytoplasm where it binds DD ELANE and subsequently co-localizes with mitochondria. In contrast, we found minimal evidence of these events following ELANE treatment of non-cancer cells. We posit that this difference is due to elevated levels of histone H1 isoforms in cancer versus non-cancer cells ( Sato et al., 2012 38. Sato, S. ∙ Takahashi, S. ∙ Asamoto, M. ... Histone H1 expression in human prostate cancer tissues and cell lines Pathol. Int. 2012; 62 :84-92 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ; Scaffidi, 2016 39. Scaffidi, P. Histone H1 alterations in cancer Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2016; 1859 :533-539 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ), which may be important for regulating chromatin structure and promoting DNA repair during genotoxic stress ( Misteli et al., 2000 29. Misteli, T. ∙ Gunjan, A. ∙ Hock, R. ... Dynamic binding of histone H1 to chromatin in living cells Nature. 2000; 408 :877-881 Crossref Scopus (531) PubMed Google Scholar ; Thorslund et al., 2015 44. Thorslund, T. ∙ Ripplinger, A. ∙ Hoffmann, S. ... Histone H1 couples initiation and amplification of ubiquitin signalling after DNA damage Nature. 2015; 527 :389-393 Crossref Scopus (300) PubMed Google Scholar ). Future studies aimed at understanding events triggering histone H1 translocation, the kinetics and stoichiometry of histone H1 and DD ELANE complexes, and the mechanism by which these complexes promote apoptosis will be required to fully characterize the selective anti-cancer pathway triggered by ELANE.
Intratumorally delivered ELANE has several intriguing properties in pre-clinical models. First, its ability to kill a wide range of cancer cells may enable its implementation without knowledge of their genetics. Indeed, we demonstrate ELANE efficacy in 9 models spanning TNBC, melanoma, and lung cancer. Second, its specificity for cancer versus non-cancer cells may limit potential toxicity, a possibility that is strengthened by the lack of side effects observed in tumor-free mice injected with ELANE. This selective killing also preserves immune cells, allowing them to capitalize on liberated antigens and generate an adaptive immune response that extends efficacy to metastatic sites. This combination of therapeutic properties differentiates ELANE from other anti-cancer modalities.
The dependency of ELANE’s anti-cancer properties on its catalytic activity has important physiological and therapeutic implications. From a physiological perspective, we show that unlike human neutrophils, murine neutrophils release ELANE in a catalytically inactive form by co-releasing the serine protease inhibitor SLPI, which is absent in human neutrophils. This species difference in ELANE biology adds to the growing list of differential functional properties between human and murine neutrophils ( Eruslanov et al., 2017 13. Eruslanov, E.B. ∙ Singhal, S. ∙ Albelda, S.M. Mouse versus Human Neutrophils in Cancer: A Major Knowledge Gap Trends Cancer. 2017; 3 :149-160 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (112) PubMed Google Scholar ), which may in part help to conceptualize their contentious roles in tumor development ( Coffelt et al., 2016 8. Coffelt, S.B. ∙ Wellenstein, M.D. ∙ de Visser, K.E. Neutrophils in cancer: neutral no more Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2016; 16 :431-446 Crossref Scopus (1237) PubMed Google Scholar ; Fridlender et al., 2009 16. Fridlender, Z.G. ∙ Sun, J. ∙ Kim, S. ... Polarization of tumor-associated neutrophil phenotype by TGF-beta: “N1” versus “N2” TAN Cancer Cell. 2009; 16 :183-194 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2461) PubMed Google Scholar ). It also suggests that previous studies of Elane −/− mice may require re-interpretation. For example, Elane −/− mice have diminished tumor growth ( Houghton et al., 2010 18. Houghton, A.M. ∙ Rzymkiewicz, D.M. ∙ Ji, H. ... Neutrophil elastase-mediated degradation of IRS-1 accelerates lung tumor growth Nat. Med. 2010; 16 :219-223 Crossref Scopus (576) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting that ELANE promotes tumorigenesis. However, we provide unequivocal evidence that ELANE kills cancer cells and opposes tumor development when injected intratumorally. Based on the inability of murine neutrophils to release catalytically active ELANE, it is possible that these previously reported effects are due to changes in neutrophil biology due to loss of ELANE. Indeed, Elane −/− neutrophils have altered ability to migrate to inflammatory sites and respond to inflammatory challenges ( Colom et al., 2015 9. Colom, B. ∙ Bodkin, J.V. ∙ Beyrau, M. ... Leukotriene B4-Neutrophil Elastase Axis Drives Neutrophil Reverse Transendothelial Cell Migration In Vivo Immunity. 2015; 42 :1075-1086 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (187) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kessenbrock et al., 2008 21. Kessenbrock, K. ∙ Fröhlich, L. ∙ Sixt, M. ... Proteinase 3 and neutrophil elastase enhance inflammation in mice by inactivating antiinflammatory progranulin J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118 :2438-2447 PubMed Google Scholar ), both of which could impact tumor development through a mechanism independent of ELANE’s paracrine effects.
From a therapeutic perspective, the reliance of ELANE’s anti-cancer properties on catalytic activity and the abundance of serine protease inhibitors in blood restrict therapeutic delivery to the intratumoral route. Although this restriction would protect against potential toxicity due to ELANE/PPE spillover from the tumor ( Fricker et al., 2014 15. Fricker, M. ∙ Deane, A. ∙ Hansbro, P.M. Animal models of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Expert Opin. Drug Discov. 2014; 9 :629-645 Crossref Scopus (135) PubMed Google Scholar ), it poses a roadblock to accessing metastatic sites. However, we show that ELANE can overcome this by creating a specific CD8 + T cell response that attacks distant tumors in mice with functional immune systems. Moreover, our demonstration of abscopal effects in a C3(1)-TAg GEM model, where genetically similar tumors arise independently and spontaneously in different mammary glands, raises the possibility of implementing ELANE therapy as an in situ vaccination.
Serine protease inhibitors also limit therapeutic efficacy in the primary tumor. Because the TME contains many serine protease inhibitors ( Chang et al., 2012 4. Chang, Y.-H. ∙ Lee, S.-H. ∙ Liao, I.-C. ... Secretomic analysis identifies alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT) as a required protein in cancer cell migration, invasion, and pericellular fibronectin assembly for facilitating lung colonization of lung adenocarcinoma cells Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2012; 11 :1320-1339 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ; Dudani et al., 2018 11. Dudani, J.S. ∙ Warren, A.D. ∙ Bhatia, S.N. Harnessing protease activity to improve cancer care Annu. Rev. Cancer Biol. 2018; 2 :353-376 Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar ), albeit at lower levels than in blood, ELANE’s catalytic activity can be inactivated resulting in protection for cancer cells. Our findings demonstrate that a porcine-derived ELANE homolog (PPE) partially overcomes this barrier. PPE mimics ELANE in terms of its ability to cleave CD95 and selectively kill cancer cells. However, because PPE is more resistant to serine protease inhibition, its catalytic activity is preserved within the TME and its anti-cancer potency is markedly improved. Indeed, we showed that 2 intratumoral injections of PPE is sufficient to immediately shrink the primary tumor and produce a more powerful CD8 + T cell-mediated abscopal effect resulting in durable responses in a subset of mice.
Collectively, our findings suggest that the proteolytic liberation of the CD95 DD domain by ELANE/PPE eliminates genetically heterogeneous cancer cells while sparing host cells. In addition to dissecting mechanisms downstream of CD95 DD liberation and histone H1 binding that underlie this selective anti-cancer pathway, future studies aimed at maximizing the therapeutic efficacy of ELANE/PPE, both as a monotherapy and in combination with other therapeutic modalities, are warranted.
First, although our findings demonstrate that human PMN media kills 35 cancer cell types, this was shown with calcein-AM, which does not implicate a specific mechanism. For feasibility, we showed that PMN media kills 6 of these cell types (MDA-MB-231, E0771, MEL888, B16F10, A549, and LLC1) via apoptosis. Similarly, ELANE’s ability to induce apoptosis and its mechanism of action were deciphered using these same 6 cell types. Accordingly, it is possible that other killing mechanisms could be involved in other cell types. Second, although our findings suggest that histone H1 isoforms contribute to selective cancer cell killing by ELANE, we mainly used H1.0 (and H1.2) to demonstrate this due to material availability. Thus, studies with other histone isoforms are warranted. Third, although our studies show that ELANE does not induce toxicity to 6 different sources of non-cancer cells (mostly primary human and mouse), extrapolation to other non-cancer cell types requires experimental validation.

Human studies were approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Chicago (IRB160321, IRB13372B). Blood was obtained from both male and female healthy donors, while omental adipose tissue neutrophils (ONs) and tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) were obtained from female patients. ONs were obtained from patients undergoing surgery for benign conditions; pre-metastatic ONs were obtained from ovarian cancer patients diagnosed at early-stage IA-IC according to International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) classification. Omental TANs were obtained from ovarian cancer patients diagnosed at FIGO stage III-IV, metastatic ovarian cancer. Patient demographics for neutrophil isolation and quantification are shown in Table S1 .
Blood was collected from healthy volunteers (IRB160321) into EDTA-coated collection tubes (BD Vacutainer), and cells were separated with Ficoll Paque Plus (GE Healthcare) to obtain a buffy coat (containing monocytes and lymphocytes) and a bottom layer (containing neutrophils and red blood cells).
PMNs were purified as previously described ( Kuhns et al., 2015 26. Kuhns, D.B. ∙ Priel, D.A.L. ∙ Chu, J. ... Isolation and functional analysis of human neutrophils Curr. Protoc. Immunol. 2015; 111 :7.23.1-7.23.16 Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar ). Briefly, cells from the bottom layer were treated with RBC lysis buffer (10min/treatment, 2 treatments, 50mL RBC lysis buffer per 5mL blood cell equivalent). Cells were centrifuged at 500x g for 5 min in between steps. Cells were resuspended into phenol red-free, serum-free DMEM, counted, and purity was assessed by flow cytometry.
Monocytes were purified and differentiated into HMDMs as previously described ( Kratz et al., 2014 23. Kratz, M. ∙ Coats, B.R. ∙ Hisert, K.B. ... Metabolic dysfunction drives a mechanistically distinct proinflammatory phenotype in adipose tissue macrophages Cell Metab. 2014; 20 :614-625 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (589) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, monocytes were purified from the buffy coat using CD14 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Monocytes were differentiated into HMDMs by culturing in RPMI containing 10%FBS supplemented with M-CSF (125ng/mL, R&D Systems), with fresh media replacement every other day until day 7.
Human lymphocytes were isolated from the buffy coat by collecting the flow through from CD14 and CD16 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec).
Omental tissue was digested with Type 1 Collagenase (1mg/mL, Worthington) in 1%BSA/PBS at 37°C with horizontal shaking at 130rpm for 75min to obtain stromal vascular cells (SVC). SVCs were filtered through 100 μm filter (ThermoFisher Scientific), incubated in RBC lysis buffer for 5 min, and passed through a 40 μm filter (ThermoFisher Scientific). ONs were isolated using CD16 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Purity was assessed by flow cytometry. Cells were centrifuged at 500x g for 5 min in between steps.
Omental tumor was digested with Type 2 Collagenase (2mg/mL, Worthington) and Hyaluronidase (Sigma, 1.5mg/mL) 1%BSA/PBS at 37°C with horizontal shaking at 130rpm for 75min. Cells were filtered through 100 μm filter (ThermoFisher Scientific), incubated in RBC lysis buffer for 5 min, and passed through a 40 μm filter (ThermoFisher Scientific). TANs were isolated using CD16 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Purity was assessed by flow cytometry. Cells were centrifuged at 500x g for 5 min in between steps.
Human primary fibroblasts were isolated from omental adipose tissue as previously described ( Kenny et al., 2007 19. Kenny, H.A. ∙ Krausz, T. ∙ Yamada, S.D. ... Use of a novel 3D culture model to elucidate the role of mesothelial cells, fibroblasts and extra-cellular matrices on adhesion and invasion of ovarian cancer cells to the omentum Int. J. Cancer. 2007; 121 :1463-1472 Crossref Scopus (210) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, omental adipose tissue was minced and incubated on an orbital shaker with 0.125% trypsin/12.5mM EDTA at 37°C for 30min. Tissue was further digested with hyaluronidase (Sigma, 100U) and Collagenase type 3 (Worthington, 1000U) at 37°C for 6h. Undigested tissue was discarded and solution containing cells was centrifuged at 1500rpm for 5min. Fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM (HyClone) containing 20% heat-inactivated FBS (Gemini Bio Products) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (GIBCO).
BMDMs were differentiated as previously described ( Kratz et al., 2014 23. Kratz, M. ∙ Coats, B.R. ∙ Hisert, K.B. ... Metabolic dysfunction drives a mechanistically distinct proinflammatory phenotype in adipose tissue macrophages Cell Metab. 2014; 20 :614-625 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (589) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, bone marrow cells were isolated from C57BL/6 mice and plated in 30% L-cell conditioned media (day 0), with fresh media replacement on days 3, 5, and 7.
A murine spleen was mashed using a cell strainer (Celltreat) on a 70 μm filter (ThermoFisher Scientific), incubated in RBC lysis buffer for 5min, and passed through a 40 μm filter (ThermoFisher Scientific). Cells were centrifuged at 500x g for 5 min in between steps.
Mouse primary keratinocytes were isolated as previously described ( Wu et al., 2008 49. Wu, X. ∙ Kodama, A. ∙ Fuchs, E. ACF7 regulates cytoskeletal-focal adhesion dynamics and migration and has ATPase activity Cell. 2008; 135 :137-148 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (226) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, primary mouse keratinocytes were isolated from the epidermis of newborn mice using trypsin, after prior separation of the epidermis from the dermis by an overnight dispase treatment. Keratinocytes were plated on mitomycin C-treated 3T3 fibroblast feeder cells until passage 3. Cells were cultured in E-low calcium media (0.05mM Ca 2+ ) supplemented with 15% heat-inactivated FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin.
BMDNs were purified as previously described ( Swamydas et al., 2015 43. Swamydas, M. ∙ Luo, Y. ∙ Dorf, M.E. ... Isolation of mouse neutrophils Curr. Protoc. Immunol. 2015; 110 :3.20.1-3.20.15 Crossref Scopus (150) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, bone marrow cells were resuspended in 1mL of ice-cold PBS and layered on top of a pre-layered solution of Histopaque 1119 (3mL, 11191, Sigma) on the bottom and Histopaque 1077 (3mL, 10771, Sigma) on top. Cells were centrifuged at 500x g for 30min at room temperature without deceleration. BMDNs were collected at the interface of the Histopaque layers, and purity was assessed by flow cytometry. For PMA activation, BMDNs were treated with PMA (100nM, Abcam) for 15min, washed, and cultured for conditioned media collection.
PNs were isolated as previously described ( Swamydas et al., 2015 43. Swamydas, M. ∙ Luo, Y. ∙ Dorf, M.E. ... Isolation of mouse neutrophils Curr. Protoc. Immunol. 2015; 110 :3.20.1-3.20.15 Crossref Scopus (150) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, mice were injected with 4% thioglycolate (3mL/mouse, Sigma). 7h-post injection, PNs were lavaged from the peritoneal cavity with 10mL of PBS, and purity was assessed by flow cytometry.
E0771 cells were injected into the mammary fat pad of C57BL/6 mice. When tumor volume reached ∼500mm 3 , tumors were digested with Type 4 Collagenase (Worthington, 3mg/mL) and hyaluronidases (Sigma, 1.5mg/mL) in 1%BSA/PBS at 37°C with horizontal shaking at 200rpm for 45min. Digested tissue was passed through 100 μm filter (ThermoFisher Scientific), incubated in RBC lysis buffer for 5 min, passed through a 40 μm filter (ThermoFisher Scientific), and purified with Ly6G microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Cells were centrifuged at 500x g for 5 min in between steps.
Murine lung was isolated and digested with Liberase TM (0.2mg/mL, Roche) and DNaseI (40 μg/mL, Sigma) 1%BSA/PBS at 37°C with horizontal shaking at 200rpm for 40min. Digested tissue was passed through a 70 μm filter (ThermoFisher Scientific), incubated in RBC lysis buffer for 5 min, passed through a 40 μm filter (ThermoFisher Scientific), and purified with the Ly6G microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Cells were centrifuged at 500x g for 5 min in between steps.
Freshly isolated human or murine neutrophils were plated at 1 million cells/600 μL serum-free DMEM for 24h. Conditioned media was collected, centrifuged at 500x g for 5min, and media protein levels were determined with a Bradford assay (Biorad): typically 30 μg/mL. Control media is serum-free DMEM. Murine neutrophil media was collected in the presence 50ug/mL deoxyribonuclease I (D4513, Sigma).
For in vivo studies, PMN or BMDN media was concentrated using a 3kDa cutoff centricon (Millipore) and 50 μg/100 μL was intratumorally injected. For boiling, PMN media was boiled at 95°C for 5min and centrifuged at 15,000x g for 10min to remove denautred proteins. For dialysis, PMN media was placed into a Slide-a-Lyzer cassette (3.5kDa cutoff, ThermoFisher Scientific) and dialyzed against 2x4L of PBS at 4°C for 4h. For size exclusion, PMN media was filtered through a 3kDa cutoff centricon (Millipore). For PMSF-inactivation, PMN media was treated with PMSF (1mM, Sigma) or A1AT (42nM, Athens Research & Technology) and incubated at room temperature for up to 2h. Residual PMSF was eliminated with a PD-10 desalting column (GE Healthcare Life). Inhibition of ELANE catalytic activity was confirmed using a chromogenic substrate activity assay (see below). For serum-spiking experiments, human, mouse, or fetal bovine serum (1% or 10%) was added to PMN media prior to or after exposing cancer cells. For immunodepletion studies, ELANE or ECP were immunoprecipitated using anti-ELANE (GTX113175, GeneTx ) or anti-ECP (MBS9209158, MyBioSource) antibodies coupled to Pierce Protein A/G Magnetic Beads (ThermoFisher Scientific).
Cancer cells or non-cancer cells were plated in complete growth media and grown to 80%–90% confluence. Cells were washed with serum-free DMEM, treated with various therapeutic agents (e.g., PMN media, ELANE, etc.) for 4-24h, and cell viability was assessed using several methods:
4-24h after treatment, cells were incubated with calcein-AM (ThermoFisher Scientific, 4ng/mL), washed with serum-free DMEM, and fluorescence was measured at 495nm/516nm using a Synergy HT Multi-Mode Microplate Reader (Biotek).
Cell-associated CASP3 activity was measured 6h after treatment using the Caspase-Glo® 3/7 Assay Systems (Promega). Luminescence was measured using a Victor X3 luminometer (PerkinElmer).
Cells were stained 30min-6h after treatment with the FITC Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit (BD PharMingen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Samples were analyzed using a FACSCanto II flow cytometer (BD PharMingen).
Cells were lysed with 1% SDS containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma), and protein was quantified with the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce). Proteins (10-20 μg) were resolved on SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore), blocked with either 5% BSA (Sigma) or 5% milk in 0.05% TBS/Tween-20 at RT for 2h, stained with primary and secondary antibodies, and visualized using the ECL detection kit (Biorad) and a LI-COR imager (Li-COR Biosciences).
Cells were treated with various doses of ELANE for 30min, washed, labeled with the CM-H2DCFDA dye (ThermoFisher Scientific, 10 μM) for 30min at 37°C, and fluorescence was quantified by flow cytometry.
Polycistronic adenoviral vectors were prepared to express the human and mouse CD95 sequences followed by the Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) internal ribosome entry site and dTomato sequence under the control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter (VectorBuilder). Human and murine cancer cells or non-cancer cells were transduced to overexpress full-length CD95, N-terminal CD95 (human: aa 1-209), C-terminal CD95 (human: aa 212-335), or express C-terminal CD95 that mimicked ELANE cleavage at both sites (aa 221-331, DD ELANE ). Cells were transduced with adenoviruses at an MOI of 50-250 depending on cell type, and expression of dTomato and CD95 (BD Biosciences) were confirmed by flow cytometry. A vector encoding GFP (VectorBuilder) was used as a control. To control for effects of viral transduction, results are plotted as a ratio of 48h (DD ELANE is expressed) to 24h (DD ELANE not yet expressed).
Cancer cells were transduced with Edit-r All-in-one lentiviral sgRNA (Dharmacon) at MOI 0.3. Knockdown cells were selected in puromycin (Sigma, 2.5 μg/mL) containing media. Individual colonies were selected, screened for CD95 expression by immunoblotting, and colonies with lowest CD95 levels were selected for additional studies.
Cancer cells were transfected with control siRNA (sc-37007) or NRP1 siRNA (sc-36038) using siRNA transfection reagents in siRNA transfection medium (sc-36868) according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Transduction efficiency and subsequent experiments were performed 48h post transfection. Cancer cells were transfected with Silencer®control (4390843), H1.0 (S6394), or H1.2 siRNA (S194487) using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX Transfection Reagent in Opti-MEM® I reduced serum medium according to the manufacturer’s protocol (ThermoFisher Scientific). Knockdown efficiency and subsequent experiments were performed 72h post transfection.
Catalytic activity was measured using the chromogenic substrate N-Methoxysuccinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val p-nitroanilide (Sigma, 100 μg/mL) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Absorbance was measured at 405nm using an accuSkan GO UV/Vis microplate spectrophotometer (ThermoFisher Scientific). 1 unit is defined as the amount of enzyme hydrolyzes 1nmol of substrate/min at 37°C. For inactivation, ELANE or PPE was incubated with PMSF (1mM, Sigma) or A1AT (at indicated dose) for 2h. Residual PMSF was eliminated with a PD-10 desalting column (GE Healthcare Life). To monitor the effects of ECP on ELANE activity, ELANE (10nM) was incubated with various doses of ECP (0-180nM) at various substrate concentrations (0-1.7mM).
Recombinant mouse ELANE (50 μg/mL) was activated with CTSC (50 μg/mL) according to the manufacturer’s protocol (R&D Systems).
For trypsin digestion, 30 μL of media (1 μg protein) were denatured by heating at 65°C and reduced with 5mM DTT for 1 h, alkylated with 15mM iodoacetamide for 30 min at room temperature in the dark, and excess iodoacetamide was quenched with an additional 5mM DTT. Samples were digested with trypsin (Promega) at 1:20 w/w ratio overnight at 37°C with mixing. After digestion, SDC was precipitated by addition of 1% trifluoroacetic acid and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 14,000x g for 10min. Samples were then desalted by solid phase extraction using Oasis HLB 96-well μElution Plate, dried down, stored at −80°C, and reconstituted with 0.1% formic acid in 5% acetonitrile to a peptide concentration of 0.1 μg/μL for LC-MS analysis.
Recombinant human C-terminal CD95 (aa 157-335, MyBioSource, 2 μg) or recombinant N-terminal CD95 (aa 1-173, ThermoFisher Scientific, 1 μg) were digested with human ELANE (0.01 μg) for 2h at 37°C, and reactions were stopped with SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Proteins were separated on 20% SDS-PAGE gels, stained with Coomassie Blue (ThermoFisher Scientific), and bands were excised for mass spectrometric analyses. Proteins were extracted from excised bands and in-gel digests were performed as follows: excised bands were washed with 100mM ammonium bicarbonate and 50% acetonitrile in 100mM ammonium bicarbonate and digested in-gel with trypsin overnight. Digested peptides were extracted with 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid, and extracts were dried down and reconstituted in 20 μL 1% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid for LC-MS/MS analysis.
Recombinant peptides (10 μM) corresponding to aa 214-(TLNPETVAINLSDVDLSK)-231 or 317-(DITSDSENSNFRNEIQSLV)-335 of human CD95 (ThermoFisher Scientific) were incubated with ELANE (0.1-0.2 μM) at 37°C for 15-30min. Reactions were stopped with 0.1% formic acid, and samples were analyzed by LC-MS/MS.
Cancer cells or non-cancer cells were transduced with FLAG-tag DD ELANE adenovirus at MOI of 200 for 36h. Cell lysates were collected in RIPA buffer (150mM NaCl, 5mM EDTA, 50mM Tris, 1% NP-40, 0.5% SDC, 0.1% SDS) with freshly added Pierce protease inhibitor mini tablets and phosphatase inhibitors. Samples were immunoprecipitated using Pierce™ Anti-DYKDDDDK magnetic agarose (ThermoFisher Scientific), eluted in 0.1M glycine pH2.8, and subjected to mass spectrometry analysis using methods described for media.
All mass spectrometry experiments were performed at the Quantitative and Functional Proteomics Core, Diabetes Research Center, University of Washington. For all studies, digested peptides were injected onto a trap column (40x0.1mm, Reprosil C18, 5 μm, Dr.Maisch, Germany), desalted for 5 min at a flow of 4 μL/min, and separated on a pulled tip analytical column (300 × 0.075 mm, Reprosil C18, 1.9 μm, Dr.Maisch, Germany) with a 3 segment linear gradient of acetonitrile, 0.1%FA (B) in water, 0.1%FA (A) as follows: 0-2 min 1%–5%B, 2-150 min 5%–25%B, 150-180 min 25%–35%B followed by column wash at 80% B and re-equilibration at a flow rate 0.4 μL/min (Waters NanoACQUITY UPLC). Tandem MS/MS spectra were acquired on Orbitrap Fusion Lumos (ThermoFisher Scientific) operated in data-dependent mode on charge states 2-4 with 2 s cycle time, dynamic exclusion of 30 s, HCD fragmentation (NCE 30%) and MS/MS acquisition in the Orbitrap.
MS spectra were acquired at a resolution 120,000 and MS/MS spectra (precursor selection window 1.6Da) at a resolution of 15,000. Peptides and proteins were identified using the Comet search engine ( Eng et al., 2015 12. Eng, J.K. ∙ Hoopmann, M.R. ∙ Jahan, T.A. ... A deeper look into Comet--implementation and features J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2015; 26 :1865-1874 Crossref Scopus (146) PubMed Google Scholar ) with PeptideProphet and ProteinProphet validation. Search criteria included a 20ppm tolerance window for precursors and products, fixed Cys alkylation, and variable Met oxidation. For recombinant peptides, data were analyzed in Skyline ( MacLean et al., 2010 28. MacLean, B. ∙ Tomazela, D.M. ∙ Shulman, N. ... Skyline: an open source document editor for creating and analyzing targeted proteomics experiments Bioinformatics. 2010; 26 :966-968 Crossref Scopus (3465) PubMed Google Scholar ) extracting ion chromatograms for all theoretical precursors arising from cleavage of all peptide bonds with a mass accuracy 10ppm. The identity of the peptides that provided significant chromatographic peaks was confirmed from MS/MS spectra.
PLA was performed using Duolink® Proximity Ligation Assay Orange Kit (Sigma) containing Anti-Rabbit PLUS and Anti-Mouse MINUS PLA probes according to the manufacturer’s protocol. MCF10A and MDA-MB-231 cells were plated in 8 well-chambered cover glass dishes (C8-1.5H-N, CellVis) and grown to ∼90% confluency. Cells were treated with ELANE (50nM) for, 0, 2, or 4 hours. For mitochondrial staining, Mito Deep Red (250 nM, ThermoFisher Scientific) was added 15min before fixation. Treated cells were fixed in acetone for 3 min, followed by a 20 min permeabilization in PBST (1XPBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100). Cells were blocked, stained with anti-FAS/CD95 (13098-1-AP Proteintech) and anti-Histone H1.0 (ab11079 Abcam) antibodies, and treated with PLUS/MINUS PLA probes. This was followed by ligation and amplification steps performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Cells were stained with DAPI for 20 min at RT prior to imaging.
Confocal images were acquired on a Leica TCS SP5 II STED laser scanning confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems) equipped with a 40x / 0.8 NA and 63X /1.4-NA oil-immersion objective. All image analyses were performed using Fiji ImageJ. For PLA quantification, whole cell regions of interest (ROIs) were selected on a three-color merged image of DAPI, MitoRed, and PLA channels. To count the number of PLA puncta per cell, a threshold binary image of the PLA channel was created. Using the ROI Manager, all ROI’s were combined, and puncta outside the combined area were cleared using Edit-Clear Outside command. Following this, the total number of punctate structures were calculated using Analyze Particles mode with a size selection of 1-250 pixels. The total number of PLA puncta per cell was calculated by dividing the number of PLA puncta per field by the total number of whole cell ROI’s selected. To count the number of PLA puncta per cell overlapped with the MitoRed signal a threshold binary image of the MitoRed channel was first created. This threshold image was multiplied with the PLA channel using the Image Calculator mode on ImageJ. The number of PLA puncta were then analyzed, similar to the method described above for the whole cell analysis.
Mice in all experimental groups were sex and age matched.
MDA-MB-231 cells (2x10 6 with Matrix Type 3) were injected into athymic nude mice; M1 or 4195 cells (50,000) were injected into NOD.SCID mice; and E0771 cells (0.5x10 6 ) were injected into C57BL/6 or Slpi−/− mice. All cells were injected into the 4 th mammary fat pad of the right ventral side.
A549 cells (2x10 6 with Matrix Type 3), or MEL888 cells (2x10 6 with Matrix Type 3) were injected into athymic nude mice, LLC1 cells (0.5x10 6 ) or B16F10 cells (1x10 6 ) were injected into C57BL/6 or Slpi−/− mice. All cells were injected subcutaneously into the flank.
B16F10 cells (0.2x10 6 ) were injected into the lateral tail vein of C57BL/6 or Slpi−/− mice to create lung colonization. Lungs were excised and the number of tumors were quantified 14 days post injection.
Once tumors reached ∼50-100mm 3 , PMN or BMDN media or HSA (50 μg/100 μL), or ELANE or PMSF-ELANE (12 μg/100 μL; 10units) were intratumorally injected once/day for 5 days; PPE or PMSF-PPE (10 units) once/day for 2 days. Tumor volume was assessed by calipers, and experiments were terminated when tumor volume in control mice reached > 1000mm 3 .
For the E0771 model, 0.5x10 6 cells were injected into the 4 th mammary fat pad of the right ventral side (1° tumor), and 0.4x10 6 cells were injected into the 4 th mammary fat pad of the left ventral side (2° tumor) of C57BL/6 mice. For the B16F10 model, 0.5x10 6 cells were injected into the flank (1° tumor). 7 days later, 0.2x10 6 cells were injected into the lateral tail vein to create 2° lung metastases.
For the ‘specificity control’, 0.5x10 6 E0771 cells were injected into the 4 th mammary fat pad of the right ventral side (1° tumor) and 7 days later, 1x10 6 B16F10 cells were injected into the flank (2° tumor). ELANE or PMSF-ELANE was injected intratumorally into 1° tumors and tumor volume at both sites was measured by calipers.
For the ‘spillover control’, 0.5x10 6 E0771 cells were injected into the 4 th mammary fat pad of the left ventral side (2° tumor). ELANE or PMSF-ELANE was injected into the tumor-free 4 th mammary fat pad of the right ventral side (i.e., opposite the tumor) and tumor volume was measured by calipers.
Once the first palpable tumor in C3(1)-TAg mice reached ∼50-100mm 3 (17-18 weeks of age), ELANE or PMSF-ELANE (12 μg, 10 units) were delivered intratumorally once/day for 5 days, or PPE or PMSF-PPE (10 units) once/day for 2 days. Tumor volume was assessed by calipers in live mice. Experiments were terminated when mice reached ∼24 weeks of age and the weight of the injected tumor, and the total weight and number of non-injected tumors were measured.
Anti-mouse Ly6G (clone 1A8, Bio X Cells) or rat IgG2b (isotype control, Bio X Cells) were injected IP (12.5 μg/injection, daily), 3 days prior to B16 cell injection (IV) and every day after injection. Neutrophil depletion was confirmed by flow cytometry.
Anti-mouse CD8α (clone 2.43, Bio X Cells) or rat IgG2b (isotype control, Bio X Cells) were injected IP (200 μg/injection) 3 days before the first ELANE treatment, and once/week after the last ELANE treatment. C3(1)-TAg mice were treated with an anti-CD8 antibody 1 week prior to ELANE treatment and once/week following ELANE treatment until mice reached 23-24 weeks of age. CD8 + T cell depletion was confirmed by flow cytometry.
Bone marrow cells (5x10 6 ) collected by PBS perfusion of the femurs and tibia of 8-week-old Slpi+/+ or Slpi−/− male mice were injected into the retro-orbital sinus of lethally irradiated (9.5 Gy ionizing radiation) 7-week-old male C57BL/6 wild-type ( Wt ) recipient mice. Mice were maintained on a Uniprim diet for 1 week before and 2 weeks after transplant and allowed to recover for 6 weeks before tail vein injection of B16F10 cells (0.2x10 6 ). Engraftment was quantified by PCR as the ratio of Slpi−/− to Wt signal using pre-defined mixtures of Slpi−/− and Wt bone marrow cells as standards.
Tumors were isolated on day 5 (1 day after ELANE/PMN media treatment, 4 days after PPE treatment). Tumors were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 24h, embedded in paraffin blocks, and sectioned (5 μm). Slides were stained with cCASP3 (9661) and cPARP (9625) antibodies from Cell Signaling Technology. Signals were developed using the VECTASTAIN ABC kit (Vector Laboratories) or fluorescently-labeled secondary antibodies (melanoma models). For the TUNEL assay, staining was performed with the DeadEnd colorimetric or fluorometric TUNEL systems (Promega). Cell nuclei were labeled with hematoxylin or Hoechst 33342 (ThermoFisher Scientific). Images were obtained with a Nikon Eclipse Ti2 microscope and analyzed using NIS-Elements software.
Tumors were isolated on day 5 (1 day after ELANE/PMN media treatment). Tumors were digested with Type 4 Collagenase (Worthington, 3mg/mL) and hyaluronidases (Sigma, 1.5mg/mL) at 37°C with shaking at 200rpm for 45min (E0771, C3(1)-TAg) or 30min (LLC1 and B16F10). Cells were labeled with various antibodies and analyzed by flow cytometry.
ELANE (12 μg/100 μL, 10 units) or PMSF-ELANE, or PMN media or HSA (50 μg/100 μL) were injected into the 4 th mammary fat pad of the right ventral side pad of tumor-free C57BL/6 mice once/day for 5 days. PPE (10 units) injections followed the same protocol except that mice were treated once/day for 2 days. Mice were studied for potential side-effects 1 day after the last therapeutic injection. Body weight and spleen weight were measured. Apoptosis at the injection site was studied by isolating, fixing, and staining mammary adipose tissue for TUNEL, cCASP3, and cPARP using identical methods described for tumors above. Mammary adipose tissue immune cell populations at the injection site were quantified by flow cytometry using identical methods described for tumors above. Liver function was assessed by measuring plasma ALT activity with the Alanine Transaminase Colorimetric Activity Assay Kit (Cayman Chemical).
Statistical significance was determined with the Student’s two-tailed, unpaired t test (p < 0.05). Linear regression, Michaelis-Menten, and hyperbolic curve fittings were performed using Prism v.7 software. For shotgun proteomics studies, significance was assessed by the G -test ( Becker et al., 2010 1. Becker, L. ∙ Gharib, S.A. ∙ Irwin, A.D. ... A macrophage sterol-responsive network linked to atherogenesis Cell Metab. 2010; 11 :125-135 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ) with Bonferonni correction (p < 0.05).

Shotgun proteomics analysis of human PMN media identifies putative anti-cancer proteins, related to Figure 2 Passing PMN media through a 0.22 μm filter attenuated its cancer cell killing capability without lowering total protein levels. PMN media from two independent donors, pre- and post-filtration, were analyzed by shotgun proteomics to identify 890 proteins (FDR < 1%). Proteins were quantified by spectral counting, and proteins significantly lowered by filtration (p < 0.05, with Bonferroni correction, ie. p < 5.6x10 −5 ) were identified by the G -test (Becker et al., 2010). Proteins significantly depleted by filtration in both donors are shaded in blue.
