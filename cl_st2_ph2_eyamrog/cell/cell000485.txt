Title: A phosphate starvation response-centered network regulates mycorrhizal symbiosis


Abstract: Summary

To secure phosphorus (P) from soil, most land plants use a direct phosphate uptake pathway via root hairs and epidermis and an indirect phosphate uptake pathway via mycorrhizal symbiosis. The interaction between these two pathways is unclear. Here, we mapped a network between transcription factors and mycorrhizal symbiosis-related genes using Y1H. Intriguingly, this gene regulatory network is governed by the conserved P-sensing pathway, centered on phosphate starvation response (PHR) transcription factors. PHRs are required for mycorrhizal symbiosis and regulate symbiosis-related genes via the P1BS motif. SPX-domain proteins suppress OsPHR2-mediated induction of symbiosis-related genes and inhibit mycorrhizal infection. In contrast, plants overexpressing OsPHR2 show improved mycorrhizal infection and are partially resistant to P-mediated inhibition of symbiosis. Functional analyses of network nodes revealed co-regulation of hormonal signaling and mycorrhizal symbiosis. This network deciphers extensive regulation of mycorrhizal symbiosis by endogenous and exogenous signals and highlights co-option of the P-sensing pathway for mycorrhizal symbiosis.

Section: Introduction

Crops rely on phosphorous (P) and nitrogen (N) for optimal yield and performance, but these nutrients are limited in most agricultural soils ( Chiou and Lin, 2011 6. Chiou, T.-J. ∙ Lin, S.-I. Signaling network in sensing phosphate availability in plants Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2011; 62 :185-206 Crossref Scopus (628) PubMed Google Scholar ; Oldroyd and Leyser, 2020 32. Oldroyd, G.E.D. ∙ Leyser, O. A plant’s diet, surviving in a variable nutrient environment Science. 2020; 368 :eaba0196 Crossref Scopus (274) PubMed Google Scholar ). To improve P and N acquisition, land plants form mutualistic relationships with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, which in turn receive carbon nutrition from the plant ( Jiang et al., 2017 21. Jiang, Y. ∙ Wang, W. ∙ Xie, Q. ...

Genre, A. ∙ Lanfranco, L. ∙ Perotto, S. ... Unique and common traits in mycorrhizal symbioses Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2020; 18 :649-660 Crossref Scopus (305) PubMed Google Scholar ). As a result, mycorrhizal-colonized roots have two pathways for nutrient absorption: directly through the root (P-sensing pathway) ( Nussaume et al., 2011 30. Nussaume, L. ∙ Kanno, S. ∙ Javot, H. ... Phosphate import in plants: focus on the PHT1 transporters Front. Plant Sci. 2011; 2 :83 Crossref Scopus (423) PubMed Google Scholar ) and indirectly via transfer from mycorrhizal hyphae into root cortical cells (mycorrhizal pathway) ( Smith et al., 2003 43. Smith, S.E. ∙ Smith, F.A. ∙ Jakobsen, I. Mycorrhizal fungi can dominate phosphate supply to plants irrespective of growth responses Plant Physiol. 2003; 133 :16-20 Crossref Scopus (756) PubMed Google Scholar ). The relationship between these two pathways is ambiguous.
AM-plant symbiosis dates back 460 million years to the earliest land plants and likely facilitated the transition from an aquatic to a terrestrial lifestyle by providing plants with the primary interface for nutrient capture ( Parniske, 2008 34. Parniske, M. Arbuscular mycorrhiza: the mother of plant root endosymbioses Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2008; 6 :763-775 Crossref Scopus (1531) PubMed Google Scholar ). AM association is widespread in the plant kingdom and intricately networked with the physiology of nutrient capture ( Wipf et al., 2019 53. Wipf, D. ∙ Krajinski, F. ∙ van Tuinen, D. ... Trading on the arbuscular mycorrhiza market: from arbuscules to common mycorrhizal networks New Phytol. 2019; 223 :1127-1142 Crossref Scopus (254) PubMed Google Scholar ). Nevertheless, how AM symbiosis is coordinated with nutrient capture is largely unknown. Loss-of-function screens in mycorrhizal host species, such as Medicago , Lotus , and maize, are time-consuming and difficult due to genetic redundancy. Thus, key regulators, including transcription factors, have largely eluded identification.
Plant roots and AM fungi mutually release and recognize diffusible signals that trigger the differentiation of AM hyphae ( Akiyama et al., 2005 1. Akiyama, K. ∙ Matsuzaki, K. ∙ Hayashi, H.

Gutjahr, C. ∙ Parniske, M. Cell and developmental biology of arbuscular mycorrhiza symbiosis Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2013; 29 :593-617 Crossref Scopus (411) PubMed Google Scholar ). Reciprocal nutrient exchange occurs at the peri-arbuscular membrane that surrounds the arbuscules within the root cells ( Choi et al., 2018 8. Choi, J. ∙ Summers, W. ∙ Paszkowski, U.

The association of AM fungi with plants is spatiotemporally regulated at the transcription level. In plants, the GRAS family of transcription factors, including nodulation signaling pathway 1 (NSP1), nodulation signaling pathway 2 (NSP2), DELLA, reduced arbuscular mycorrhiza 1 (RAM1), required for arbuscule development 1 (RAD1), and mycorrhiza-induced GRAS 1 (MIG1), are involved in the response to AM fungi and regulating arbuscule development ( Maillet et al., 2011 29.

Plant P direct uptake pathway is controlled by a conserved pathway centered on the phosphate starvation response (PHR) transcription factors. The PHRs , such as AtPHR1 in Arabidopsis and OsPHR2 in rice, activate expression of a broad range of phosphate starvation-induced (PSI) genes by binding to the P1BS element in phosphate-deficient conditions to improve plant phosphate acquisition ( Rubio et al., 2001 38.

The SPX (named after the Saccharomyces cerevisiae SYG1 and Pho81 proteins and the mammalian Xpr1) proteins have been reported to act as phosphate sensors and negatively regulate the binding affinity of PHRs to P1BS element through protein-protein interaction in phosphate-sufficient conditions, securing plant P-homeostasis ( Wang et al., 2014c 49.

Rice SPX6 negatively regulates the phosphate starvation response through suppression of the transcription factor PHR2 New Phytol. 2018; 219 :135-148 Crossref Scopus (97) PubMed Google Scholar ). It was shown nearly 40 years ago that mycorrhizal infection of host plants is inhibited in increasing concentrations of phosphorous ( Hepper, 1983 20. Hepper, C.M. The effect of nitrate and phosphate on the vasicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal infection of lettuce New Phytol. 1983; 92 :389-399 Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar ) but whether PHRs regulate AM symbiosis is not known. To investigate the potential role of PHRs and discover global regulators that integrate mycorrhizal symbiosis, nutrient capture, and plant development, we generated a transcriptional regulatory network map underlying AM symbiosis.

Section: Results

To systematically uncover transcription factors that regulate AM symbiosis, we used the yeast one hybrid assay (Y1H) to screen 1570 rice transcription factors ( Table S1 ) for binding to 51 target rice promoters ( Table S2 ). The 51 target promoters were selected because they are involved in, or regulate genes associated with mycorrhizal symbiosis, including signaling transduction, peri-arbuscular membrane formation, nutrient exchange, lipid biosynthesis, or AM-dependent transcription ( Figure S1 A; Table S2 ).
We uncovered a highly interconnected network of 266 transcription factors and 47 target promoters ( Figure 1 A; Table S1 ), that we called the “yeast one-hybrid network for AM symbiosis” (YAM). On average, each promoter could interact with four transcription factors. The 266 transcription factors represented over 11 families, with over-representation of the MYB, C2H2, AP2-EREBP, WRKY, and GRAS families ( Table S1 ). Mycorrhizal colonization occurs in plant roots, and 72% (192/266) of the YAM transcription factors were expressed in roots (fragments per kilobase of exon per million mapped fragments [FPKM] ≥1) ( Figure S1 B; Table S3 ). Additionally, 19 of the YAM transcription factors showed increased expression (log2 > 1, adjusted p < 0.001) in AM-colonized roots compared to non-colonized roots ( Figure S1 B; Table S3 ). The YAM captured the known interaction between CYCLOPS and the RAM1 promoter ( Figure 1 A) ( Pimprikar et al., 2016 35. Pimprikar, P. ∙ Carbonnel, S. ∙ Paries, M. ... A CCaMK-CYCLOPS-DELLA complex activates transcription of RAM1 to regulate arbuscule branching Curr. Biol. 2016; 26 :987-998 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (146) PubMed Google Scholar ), validating our assay. Moreover, six of the YAM transcription factors, including RAM1/RAD1, WRI5a/b, DIP1, and CYCLOPS, have known roles in mycorrhizal symbiosis in rice and other plant species ( Figure 1 A) ( Gobbato et al., 2012 16.

Altogether, the network uncovered 511 interactions, although false negatives and false positives are possible in all network approaches ( Figure 1 A; Table S1 ) ( Walhout, 2011 46. Walhout, A.J. What does biologically meaningful mean? A perspective on gene regulatory network validation Genome Biol. 2011; 12 :109 Crossref Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The YAM revealed a previously undescribed, putative hierarchical regulation of transcription factors in mycorrhizal symbiosis ( Figure 1 A). Interestingly, gene ontology analysis showed that the transcription factors in the YAM are enriched for the regulation of N compound metabolism, macromolecule biosynthesis, and nucleobase-containing compound metabolism ( Table S3 ). The YAM included key transcription factors that control diverse hormone signaling pathways, such as ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE3-LIKE1 (OsEIL1/MHZ6) and OsEIL2 ( Yang et al., 2015 58. Yang, C. ∙ Ma, B. ∙ He, S.-J. ... MAOHUZI6/ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3-LIKE1 and ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3-LIKE2 regulate ethylene response of roots and coleoptiles and negatively affect salt tolerance in rice Plant Physiol. 2015; 169 :148-165 Crossref Scopus (154) PubMed Google Scholar ) that positively regulate ethylene signaling, AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 12 (OsARF12) and OsARF25 that regulate auxin signaling and phosphate homeostasis in rice ( Wang et al., 2014b 48. Wang, S. ∙ Zhang, S. ∙ Sun, C. ... Auxin response factor (OsARF12), a novel regulator for phosphate homeostasis in rice ( Oryza sativa ) New Phytol. 2014; 201 :91-103 Crossref Scopus (113) PubMed Google Scholar ), and OsMYC2 that regulates jasmonic acid signaling ( Cai et al., 2014 3. Cai, Q. ∙ Yuan, Z. ∙ Chen, M. ... Jasmonic acid regulates spikelet development in rice Nat. Commun. 2014; 5 :3476 Crossref Scopus (226) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 1 B; Table S1 ). Moreover, 12 of the transcription factors within the YAM were related to P-starvation ( Figure S1 B; Table S3 ). Overall, these data suggest substantial regulatory cross-talk between mycorrhizal symbiosis, nutrient metabolism, and hormone signaling.
To validate the function of YAM network nodes in mycorrhizal symbiosis, we assayed available RNAi and mutant rice lines.
OsEIL1/MHZ6 and OsEIL2 are known to be required for ethylene signaling transduction and their corresponding mutant plants are insensitive to ethylene ( Yang et al., 2015 58. Yang, C. ∙ Ma, B. ∙ He, S.-J. ... MAOHUZI6/ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3-LIKE1 and ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3-LIKE2 regulate ethylene response of roots and coleoptiles and negatively affect salt tolerance in rice Plant Physiol. 2015; 169 :148-165 Crossref Scopus (154) PubMed Google Scholar ). We observed higher mycorrhizal colonization with normal arbuscule morphology in OsEIL2 RNAi plant roots compared to wild-type roots ( Figures 1 B, 1C, and S2 A–S2D), as well as increased transcript levels of the rice AM marker genes OsPT11 , OsAM1 , OsAM3 , OsHA1 , and OsARK1 ( Figure S2 C). In contrast, two independent mutants of OsEIL1 / MHZ6 consistently displayed wild-type colonization ( Figure S2 E). In the YAM, OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 regulate the expression of the mycorrhizal colonization-specific H + -ATPase OsHA1 ( Figures 1 B and S2 C), which plays an important role in nutrient exchange ( Wang et al., 2014a 47. Wang, E. ∙ Yu, N. ∙ Bano, S.A. ... A H+-ATPase that energizes nutrient uptake during mycorrhizal symbioses in rice and Medicago truncatula Plant Cell. 2014; 26 :1818-1830 Crossref Scopus (131) PubMed Google Scholar ; Krajinski et al., 2014 24. Krajinski, F. ∙ Courty, P.-E. ∙ Sieh, D. ... The H+-ATPase HA1 of Medicago truncatula Is Essential for Phosphate Transport and Plant Growth during Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Symbiosis Plant Cell. 2014; 26 :1808-1817 Crossref Scopus (113) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, we hypothesize that ethylene signaling might inhibit nutrient exchange at the peri-arbuscular interface and, in turn, mycorrhizal symbiosis.
OsARF12 and OsARF25 are known negative regulators in phosphate homeostasis and required for rice root development ( Wang et al., 2014b 48. Wang, S. ∙ Zhang, S. ∙ Sun, C. ... Auxin response factor (OsARF12), a novel regulator for phosphate homeostasis in rice ( Oryza sativa ) New Phytol. 2014; 201 :91-103 Crossref Scopus (113) PubMed Google Scholar ). We observed lower mycorrhizal colonization in Osarf12/25 double mutants compared to wild-type roots ( Figures 1 B, 1D, and S2 F–S2I), along with reduced expression levels of OsPT11 , OsAM1 , and OsARK1 ( Figure S2 H). Wild-type and Osarf12/25 double mutants showed similar arbuscule morphologies ( Figure S2 I). In the YAM, OsARF12/25 bind to promoters of OsHA1 , the potassium transporter OsHAK3 , and lipid biosynthesis enzyme genes OsRAM2 and OsRAM2L ( Figure 1 B). Interestingly, higher expression of OsHA1 was found in Osarf12/25 double mutants ( Figure S2 H), however, the mechanisms need to be explored.
Knockout of the YAM components OsRAM1 and OsWRI5a/b also diminished mycorrhizal symbiosis, when compared to wild-type roots ( Figures 1 E, 1F, and S3 A–S3I), consistent with the involvement of RAM1 and WR15 in AM symbiosis in Medicago , Lotus , and Petunia ( Gobbato et al., 2012 16.

Network of GRAS transcription factors involved in the control of arbuscule development in Lotus japonicus Plant Physiol. 2015; 167 :854-871 Crossref Scopus (128) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The MYB-type transcription factor OsMYBc was also part of the YAM and regulates salt tolerance by directly targeting potassium transporter gene OsHKT1;1 ( Wang et al., 2015 50. Wang, R. ∙ Jing, W. ∙ Xiao, L. ... The rice high-affinity potassium transporter1;1 is involved in salt tolerance and regulated by an MYB-type transcription factor Plant Physiol. 2015; 168 :1076-1090 Crossref Scopus (202) PubMed Google Scholar ). Osmybc mutants also showed a reduced mycorrhizal colonization level with normal arbuscule morphology compared to wild-type ( Figures 1 G and S3 J–S3M), suggesting a potential co-regulation of salt tolerance and mycorrhizal symbiosis.
In addition, no consistently significant change in mycorrhizal colonization was observed in Osmyc2-1 and Osmyc2-2 mutants ( Figures S2 J and S2K).
Overall, these data demonstrate that the nodes within the YAM network regulate AM symbiosis. Nevertheless, future studies, particularly complementation analysis, are needed to confirm the function of OsEIL1 , OsEIL2 , OsARF12/25 , and OsMYBc in mycorrhizal symbiosis.
Our Y1H analysis revealed that the phosphate starvation response regulators, OsPHR1/2/3, activate 25 of the 51 target promoters, including key transcription factors ( OsRAM1 , OsRAD1 , and OsWRI5A ), a phosphate transporter ( OsPT11 ), and an ammonium transporter ( OsAMT3;1 ). OsRAD1 , OsRAM1 , and OsWRI5 themselves regulate the expression of many mycorrhizal symbiosis-related genes, creating a suite of potential feed-forward loops ( Figure 2 A). We further employed a robust computational method ( Tian et al., 2020 45. Tian, F. ∙ Yang, D.-C. ∙ Meng, Y.-Q. ... PlantRegMap: charting functional regulatory maps in plants Nucleic Acids Res. 2020; 48 :D1104-D1113 PubMed Google Scholar ) to determine the transcription factor binding motifs that are enriched within the promoters of genes that are upregulated and downregulated by AM symbiosis ( Table S4 ). We found that binding motifs for 78 transcription factors were enriched within AM-regulated genes in rice, including OsPHR1/2/3 ( Table S4 ). Intriguingly, 42% of AM-regulated genes were predicted to be directly regulated by OsPHR1/2/3 and in total, 87% were regulated by OsPHR1/2/3 ( Figure 2 B). Thus, we hypothesized that OsPHR1/2/3 is a transcriptional hub and functions as a key upstream regulator in mycorrhizal symbiosis ( Figures 2 A and 2B; Table S1 ).
To investigate the OsPHR-centered regulatory network, we analyzed the promoters of several key mycorrhizal-related genes. Promoters that are targeted by OsPHR and induced by phosphate starvation contain a consensus PHR binding sequence (P1BS element) ( Guo et al., 2015 17. Guo, M. ∙ Ruan, W. ∙ Li, C. ... Integrative Comparison of the Role of the PHOSPHATE RESPONSE1 Subfamily in Phosphate Signaling and Homeostasis in Rice Plant Physiol. 2015; 168 :1762-1776 Crossref Scopus (153) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rubio et al., 2001 38. Rubio, V. ∙ Linhares, F. ∙ Solano, R. ... A conserved MYB transcription factor involved in phosphate starvation signaling both in vascular plants and in unicellular algae Genes Dev. 2001; 15 :2122-2133 Crossref Scopus (1036) PubMed Google Scholar ), and we found that the promoters of OsRAM1 , OsWRI5A , OsPT11 , and OsAMT3;1 contain at least two P1BS elements ( Figure S4 A). We subsequently performed an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) with promoter fragments containing the P1BS from OsRAM1 , OsWRI5A , OsPT11 , and OsAMT3;1 and extracts of Escherichia coli expressing either MBP-conjugated OsPHR2 (MBP-OsPHR2) or MBP. We observed a mobility shift for all the probes in the presence of MBP-OsPHR2 but not MBP ( Figures 2 C and 2D). The intensity of the shift depended on the probe ( Figures 2 C and 2D), suggesting that the probes have different affinities for OsPHR2. Moreover, excess unlabeled probe, but not a P1BS-mutated unlabeled probe, could compete with the corresponding labeled probe and eliminate the observed shift ( Figures 2 C, 2D, and S4 B), indicating the specificity of the interactions. Similar results were obtained using MBP-OsPHR1 and MBP-OsPHR3 ( Figures S4 C–S4E). These data support a direct interaction between OsPHR1/2/3 and the promoters of OsRAM1 , OsWRI5A , OsPT11 , and OsAMT3;1 via P1BS elements.
Second, to determine whether OsPHR2 can transactive these promoters in planta , we performed a luciferase reporter assay in N. benthamiana leaves. Briefly, we co-infiltrated four luciferase reporters driven by the promoters from OsRAM1 , OsWRI5A , OsPT11 , or OsAMT3;1 ( Promoter:LUC ) with Pro35S:OsPHR2 (or empty vector control). OsPHR2 induced the expression of all the reporters, inferred from the stronger firefly luciferase activity in the presence of OsPHR2 compared to the control ( Figures 2 E and 2F). Thus, OsPHR2 can activate AM-specific gene promoters in planta .
Third, to assay whether the P1BS regulatory element is essential for the expression of mycorrhizal-specific marker genes during mycorrhizal infection, we designed a series of deletion constructs of the OsPT11 promoter ( Figure 2 G). Consistent with the function of OsPT11 in mycorrhizal symbiosis, the OsPT11 promoter is active exclusively in arbuscule-containing cells ( Yang et al., 2012 57. Yang, S.-Y. ∙ Grønlund, M. ∙ Jakobsen, I. ... Nonredundant regulation of rice arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis by two members of the phosphate transporter1 gene family Plant Cell. 2012; 24 :4236-4251 Crossref Scopus (287) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although OsPT11 promoters lacking any one of the three P1BS could drive expression of a GUS reporter in arbuscule-containing cells, deletion of all the three P1BS regulatory elements from the OsPT11 promoter abolished GUS activity ( Figure 2 G). Moreover, OsPHR2 associated with OsPT11 promoter in vivo ( Figure S4 F). These data are consistent with previous work showing that the P1BS element is important for specific expression of OsPT11 orthologs in solanaceous plants ( Chen et al., 2011a; Lota et al., 2013 4. Chen, A. ∙ Gu, M. ∙ Sun, S. ... Identification of two conserved cis-acting elements, MYCS and P1BS, involved in the regulation of mycorrhiza-activated phosphate transporters in eudicot species New Phytol. 2011; 189 :1157-1169 Crossref Scopus (117) PubMed Google Scholar 26. Lota, F. ∙ Wegmüller, S. ∙ Buer, B. ... The cis -acting CTTC-P1BS module is indicative for gene function of LjVTI12, a Qb-SNARE protein gene that is required for arbuscule formation in Lotus japonicus Plant J. 2013; 74 :280-293 Crossref Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar ). Altogether, these data suggest that the P1BS elements contribute to AM-induced expression of OsPT11 in arbuscule-containing cells.
OsPHR1 and OsPHR3 are closely related to OsPHR2 in a phylogenetic tree of distantly related plant species ( Figure S4 C). Although OsPHR1/2/3 transcript levels in total roots were unaffected by mycorrhizal infection ( Figure S4 G), the localization of OsPHR2 expression was altered in rice mycorrhizal colonized versus non-colonized root cells ( Figures S4 H and S4I), with OsPHR2 showing highly enriched expression in arbuscule-containing cells. Importantly, we observed a significant reduction of mycorrhizal infection in Osphr2-1 mutant roots with small arbuscule compared to wild-type roots at 2-, 4-, and 6-weeks post inoculation (wpi) ( Figures 3 A–3D and S5 A). Mycorrhizal infection in Osphr2-1 mutant roots was restored to almost wild-type levels upon ubiquitous expression of the OsPHR2 coding sequence ( Figures S5 B and S5C). We used CRISPR-Cas9 technology to generate Osphr2-2 mutants, which also showed impaired mycorrhizal infection ( Figures S5 B and S5D). Interestingly, comparison of transcriptome changes in AM colonized and non-colonized roots of wild-type and Osphr2-1 mutant identified 2042 genes that were affected by loss-of-function of OsPHR2 . 1396 genes altered expression level in Osphr2-1 mutant compared to wild-type upon mycorrhizal colonization, of which 237 genes overlapped with the AM-regulated genes in wild-type and Osphr2-1 mutant. Thus, loss-of-function of OsPHR2 altered the expression of 63% ((2042 + 237)/3602) mycorrhizal response genes ( Figures S5 E and S5F; Table S5 ). Consistent with the role of OsPHR2 in regulating OsRAM1 , OsWRI5A , OsPT11 , and OsAMT3;1 , we found that expression of OsRAM1 , OsWRI5A , OsPT11 , and OsAMT3;1 was impaired in Osphr2 mutant ( Table S5 ).
We also found that overexpression of OsPHR1 and OsPHR2 lead to significantly increased mycorrhizal colonization compared to the control, with similar arbuscule morphology ( Figures 3 E, 3G, and S5 G–S5J). In addition, overexpression of OsPHR2 was sufficient to partially induce the expression of some mycorrhizal marker genes, such as OsAMT3 and OsWRI5A, even in the absence of mycorrhizal fungal infection ( Figure S5 K). However, these two genes are expressed at very lower levels in OsPHR2 OE rice compared to AM-infected rice ( Figure S5 K), indicating that additional symbiosis factors are required to achieve full induction.
To determine if OsPHR1 , OsPHR3 , and OsPHR2 function redundantly in mycorrhizal symbiosis, we examined mycorrhizal colonization in Osphr1/2-1/3 triple mutants ( Guo et al., 2015 17. Guo, M. ∙ Ruan, W. ∙ Li, C. ... Integrative Comparison of the Role of the PHOSPHATE RESPONSE1 Subfamily in Phosphate Signaling and Homeostasis in Rice Plant Physiol. 2015; 168 :1762-1776 Crossref Scopus (153) PubMed Google Scholar ). Strikingly, we found that mycorrhizal fungal infection was severely decreased in the Osphr1/2-1/3 triple mutant ( Figures 3 A–3D and S5 L), as strong as in Osram1 mutant ( Figure 1 E). The reduced colonization levels of Osphr2-1 and Osphr1/2-1/3 mutants correlated with a limited induction of the AM symbiosis marker genes OsAM1 , OsAM3 , OsPT11 , OsHA1 , and OsARK1 ( Figure S5 M).
Altogether, our results strongly suggest that a PHR-centered network controls mycorrhizal infection via PIBS-dependent mycorrhizal-specific gene expression.
The nutrient status, including P, of host plants is known to negatively correlate with the degree of mycorrhizal colonization ( Hepper, 1983 20. Hepper, C.M. The effect of nitrate and phosphate on the vasicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal infection of lettuce New Phytol. 1983; 92 :389-399 Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar ). Given the PHR-centered regulatory network, we hypothesized that P regulates AM symbiosis via PHR. Intriguingly, plants that overexpress OsPHR2 are partially resistant to phosphate-mediated inhibition of mycorrhizal symbiosis: AM colonization decreased by ∼20% in wild-type plants when treated with 200 μM Pi, whereas it decreased by only 5% without no significant reduction in OsPHR2 overexpression lines after 2 weeks Pi treatment ( Figures 3 E and 3F). Consistently, OsPHR2 overexpression attenuates phosphate-mediated inhibition of mycorrhizal symbiosis after 2 weeks 400 μM Pi treatment or after 4 weeks 200 μM Pi and 400 μM Pi treatments ( Figures 3 G and 3H). Altogether, these data suggest that the PHR-centered YAM network is active in low phosphate conditions, and overexpression of OsPHR2 can partially antagonize the P-mediated inhibition of AM colonization.
SPX domain-containing proteins maintain phosphate homeostasis by acting as P sensors in plants and yeast ( Wild et al., 2016 52. Wild, R. ∙ Gerasimaite, R. ∙ Jung, J.Y. ... Control of eukaryotic phosphate homeostasis by inositol polyphosphate sensor domains Science. 2016; 352 :986-990 Crossref Scopus (412) PubMed Google Scholar ). In plants, SPX proteins bind to OsPHR2 in high phosphate conditions, thus inhibiting OsPHR2 binding to P1BS elements in the promoter of phosphate-starvation-induced (PSI) genes and reducing PSI gene expression ( Lv et al., 2014 27. Lv, Q. ∙ Zhong, Y. ∙ Wang, Y. ... SPX4 negatively regulates phosphate signaling and homeostasis through its interaction with PHR2 in rice Plant Cell. 2014; 26 :1586-1597 Crossref Scopus (248) PubMed Google Scholar ; Puga et al., 2014 36. Puga, M.I. ∙ Mateos, I. ∙ Charukesi, R. ... SPX1 is a phosphate-dependent inhibitor of Phosphate Starvation Response 1 in Arabidopsis Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111 :14947-14952 Crossref Scopus (351) PubMed Google Scholar ; Shi et al., 2014 42. Shi, J. ∙ Hu, H. ∙ Zhang, K. ... The paralogous SPX3 and SPX5 genes redundantly modulate Pi homeostasis in rice J. Exp. Bot. 2014; 65 :859-870 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2014c 49. Wang, Z. ∙ Ruan, W. ∙ Shi, J. ... Rice SPX1 and SPX2 inhibit phosphate starvation responses through interacting with PHR2 in a phosphate-dependent manner Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111 :14953-14958 Crossref Scopus (320) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhong et al., 2018 62. Zhong, Y. ∙ Wang, Y. ∙ Guo, J. ... Rice SPX6 negatively regulates the phosphate starvation response through suppression of the transcription factor PHR2 New Phytol. 2018; 219 :135-148 Crossref Scopus (97) PubMed Google Scholar ). We reasoned that SPX proteins might also inhibit the PHR-centered network that drives mycorrhizal symbiosis. To test this hypothesis, we used the luciferase assay in N. benthamiana leaves. Briefly, each luciferase reporter ( ProOsRAM1:LUC , ProOsWRI5A:LUC , ProOsPT11:LUC , and ProOsAMT3;1:LUC ) was tested in four conditions: with or without OsPHR2, and with or without OsSPX1 ( Figure 4 A, left). We found that OsSPX1 specifically suppressed OsPHR2-mediated activation of all four mycorrhizal-related promoters ( Figures 4 A, 4B, S6 A, and S6B).
To determine whether SPX proteins inhibit AM symbiosis in rice, we first performed overexpression experiments. Indeed, constitutive overexpression of OsSPX1 and OsSPX2 led to a significantly lower frequency of arbuscule formation and mycorrhizal colonization of rice roots ( Figures 4 C and S6 C–S6F), suggesting that SPX proteins are sufficient to inhibit AM colonization via the PHR-centered network. However, our loss-of-function experiments showed that Osspx1spx2 double mutants displayed similar AM colonization levels as wild-type roots ( Figure S6 G).
We found that OsPHRs interact with all six OsSPX proteins in yeast ( Figure S6 H), suggesting that OsSPX-mediated regulation might be substantially redundant. Therefore, we employed a multiplex CRISPR-CAS9 genome editing approach to knockout OsSPX1/2/3/4/5/6 in rice and isolated two alleles of Osspx1/2/3/5 quadruple mutants ( Figures S6 I and S6J). The Osspx1/2/3/5 quadruple mutants showed a significantly increased phosphate starvation response in both Pi-deficient (10 μM Pi) and Pi-sufficient (200 μM Pi) conditions ( Figures 4 D–4F). Intriguingly, we observed a significantly higher frequency of arbuscule formation and colonization levels in two independent Osspx1/2/3/5 quadruple mutants compared to the wild-type control at 4- and 6-wpi ( Figures 5 A–5C), along with increased transcript levels of the rice AM marker genes OsPT11 , OsAM1 , OsAM3 , OsHA1 , and OsARK1 ( Figure S6 K). Wild-type and Osspx1/2/3/5 quadruple mutants displayed a similar arbuscule morphology ( Figures 5 C and S6 L). Moreover, Osspx1/2/3/5 quadruple mutants were partially resistant to Pi-mediated inhibition of mycorrhizal colonization ( Figures 5 D–5G). Altogether, our data suggest that SPX proteins negatively regulate mycorrhizal symbiosis via the PHR-centered network ( Figure 6 ).

Section: Discussion

Our work uncovered hundreds of transcription factors as putative regulators within a map of the rice-arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis network ( Figure 1 A). We validated the nodes of the regulatory network, which includes key transcription factors in hormone signaling pathways. Accordingly, perturbing six distinct nodes (OsEIL2, OsARF12/25, OsMYBc, OsWRI5A/B, OsRAM1, and OsPHR1/2/3) of the PHR-centered network altered mycorrhizal infection. Altogether, we uncovered multiple potential connections between rice transcription factors and AM-induced promoters, including that OsPHR2 interacts with the promoters of OsWRI5A , OsRAM1 , and OsRAD1 in the yeast one hybrid assay. OsRAD1 also interacts with the promoters of OsWRI5A and OsRAM1 , suggesting a dense network of feed forward loops. The YAM revealed a PHR-centered regulatory network that regulates AM symbiosis. The identified network will serve as a foundation for understanding the regulation of a complex, integral mycorrhizal symbiosis by endogenous and exogenous signals.
The PHR-centered regulatory hierarchy controlling the direct P-sensing pathway appears to be conserved in different plant species ( Wykoff et al., 1999 54. Wykoff, D.D. ∙ Grossman, A.R. ∙ Weeks, D.P. ... Psr1, a nuclear localized protein that regulates phosphorus metabolism in Chlamydomonas Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96 :15336-15341 Crossref Scopus (213) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rubio et al., 2001 38. Rubio, V. ∙ Linhares, F. ∙ Solano, R. ... A conserved MYB transcription factor involved in phosphate starvation signaling both in vascular plants and in unicellular algae Genes Dev. 2001; 15 :2122-2133 Crossref Scopus (1036) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhou et al., 2008 63. Zhou, J. ∙ Jiao, F. ∙ Wu, Z. ... OsPHR2 is involved in phosphate-starvation signaling and excessive phosphate accumulation in shoots of plants Plant Physiol. 2008; 146 :1673-1686 Crossref Scopus (513) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mutation of OsPHR1/2/3 disrupts direct uptake via the P-sensing pathway and led to low P accumulation ( Guo et al., 2015 17. Guo, M. ∙ Ruan, W. ∙ Li, C. ... Integrative Comparison of the Role of the PHOSPHATE RESPONSE1 Subfamily in Phosphate Signaling and Homeostasis in Rice Plant Physiol. 2015; 168 :1762-1776 Crossref Scopus (153) PubMed Google Scholar ). The phosphorus status of host plant is negatively correlated with the degree of mycorrhizal infection ( Hepper, 1983 20. Hepper, C.M. The effect of nitrate and phosphate on the vasicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal infection of lettuce New Phytol. 1983; 92 :389-399 Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar ). Thus, higher mycorrhizal colonization of Osphr1/2-1/3 triple mutant might be expected, given their low accumulation of P ( Guo et al., 2015 17. Guo, M. ∙ Ruan, W. ∙ Li, C. ... Integrative Comparison of the Role of the PHOSPHATE RESPONSE1 Subfamily in Phosphate Signaling and Homeostasis in Rice Plant Physiol. 2015; 168 :1762-1776 Crossref Scopus (153) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, we found that mycorrhizal fungal infection was severely decreased in the Osphr1/2-1/3 triple mutant, demonstrating that PHRs are critical for mycorrhizal symbiosis ( Figure 6 ).
Over the past two decades, the mycorrhizal factor (Myc factor) signaling pathway has been established as required for mycorrhizal infection and arbuscule development ( Choi et al., 2018a; Oldroyd, 2013 8. Choi, J. ∙ Summers, W. ∙ Paszkowski, U. Mechanisms underlying establishment of arbuscular mycorrhizal symbioses Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 2018; 56 :135-160 Crossref Scopus (116) PubMed Google Scholar 31. Oldroyd, G.E.D. Speak, friend, and enter: signalling systems that promote beneficial symbiotic associations in plants Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2013; 11 :252-263 Crossref Scopus (1142) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, we found that overexpression of OsPHR2 and mutated OsSPXs can partially activate the expression of some mycorrhizal marker genes ( Figures S5 K and S6 M), suggesting that full activation of mycorrhizal-related gene expression in arbuscular cells likely requires both PHRs and the Myc signaling pathway.
Together, our data suggest that direct pathway and indirect pathway via AM symbiosis that most land plants use to secure phosphate are regulated by same phosphate sensing-centered pathway in rice. We anticipate that these findings will assist in breeding efforts to generate plants that use P more efficiently.
In this study, we revealed a highly interconnected network of 266 transcription factors and 47 target promoters in rice using yeast-one-hybrid analysis, providing exciting and extensive resource to be explored for the research community. OsRAM1 , OsWRI5A/B , OsMYC2 , OsEIL1 , OsEIL2 , and OsARF12/25 were selected for validation of the YAM. However, further studies, including complementation analysis, are needed to confirm and explore the mechanisms of OsEIL1 , OsEIL2 , OsARF12/25 , and OsMYBc in mycorrhizal symbiosis. In addition, we found that loss-of-function of OsPHR2 altered the expression of 63% of mycorrhizal response genes, and 42% of AM-regulated genes were directly regulated by OsPHR2 according to transcription factor enrichment analysis. Currently, we failed to obtain high quality DNA for sequencing after chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) from 6 wpi mycorrhizal colonized roots. Unbiased, genome-wide approaches such as adopted ChIP-seq could be used in future study to identify the complete set of OsPHR2 targets in AM symbiosis.

Osspx1spx2 double mutants were generated by crossing Osspx1 and Osspx2 mutants ( Wang et al., 2014c 49. Wang, Z. ∙ Ruan, W. ∙ Shi, J. ... Rice SPX1 and SPX2 inhibit phosphate starvation responses through interacting with PHR2 in a phosphate-dependent manner Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111 :14953-14958 Crossref Scopus (320) PubMed Google Scholar ). Osphr2-2, Oswri5a/b-1/2, Osram1-1/2, Osmyc2-1/2 mutants were generated using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-CAS9 mediated editing methods in Nipponbare in this study. Osspx1/2/3/5 quadruple mutants were generated using multiplex Crispr/cas9 technique in Nipponbare in this study. The complementary line ProUbi:OsPHR2-FLAG/Osphr2-1 was generated by crossing Osphr2-1 and ProUbi:OsPHR2-FLAG plants. Plants were grown at the experimental station in Shanghai.
Nicotiana benthamiana for transient expression assay was grown at 22°C under 16 h day/ 8 h night condition.
The arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus R. irregularis was co-cultured with leek in the mixture of sand and perlite (1:1) at 28°C 16 h day/ 8 h night condition.
Saccharomyces Cerevisiae strains AH109 and YM4271 were stored at −70°C freezer and cultured at 28°C incubator. The Saccharomyces Cerevisiae strain Y187 harbors rice transcription factors was provided by OE biotech (Shanghai).
Rice seeds were surface-sterilized with 75% ethyl alcohol for 1 min and 25% sodium hypochlorite for 30 min, followed by five washes with sterile water. The seeds were then transferred to half-strength Murashige and Skoog (1/2 MS) medium. For AM fungi infection, seeds were germinated and grew for two weeks in phytochamber with 12 h light/12 h dark at 28°C /22°C and 70% relative humidity. Then the seedlings were transplanted into a vermicμlite, sand and perlite (3:1:1) mixture containing R. irregμlaris spores (400 spores per plant) and cultured in green house with 12 h light/12 h dark at 28°C. The R. irregularis spores were produced in an R. irregularis/ leek co-culture substrate. When the rice plants were inoculated with R. irregμlaris in the substrate (vermiculite, sand and perlite (3:1:1) mixture) (Pi concentration, 1.78 μg/g), proper amounts of water were supplied in the first two weeks for plant growth. Subsequently, ten milliliters of Hoagland solution with 0 μM KH 2 PO 4 , 200 μM KH 2 PO 4 (Pi-sufficient) and 400 μM KH 2 PO 4 (Pi-excess) were applied to the plants every two days from the third weeks until harvested.
Hydroponic experiments were conducted using rice solution culture ( Zhou et al., 2008 63. Zhou, J. ∙ Jiao, F. ∙ Wu, Z. ... OsPHR2 is involved in phosphate-starvation signaling and excessive phosphate accumulation in shoots of plants Plant Physiol. 2008; 146 :1673-1686 Crossref Scopus (513) PubMed Google Scholar ). The concentration of NaH 2 PO 4 was adjusted to 10 μM and 200 μM for Pi-deficient and Pi-sufficient conditions, respectively. Rice seeds were pregerminated in water for 3 days and transferred into Pi-sufficient rice solution culture for 10 days. Half of the seedlings were then transferred to Pi-deficient solution culture for 20 days. Rice plants were grown in a phytochamber with 12 h light (28°C)/12 h dark (22°C) and 70% relative humidity.
The concentration of phosphorus in rice was determined using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS). For shoot phosphorus concentration determination, we harvested 1 cm from the leaf tip of the top second leaf. Shoots or roots from 3 plants were mixed as one sample. The collected shoots and roots were rinsed with ultrapure water for five times, dried at 65°C for 5 days, and samples from various genotypes were weighed. All dried samples were digested with 1 mL 65% nitric acid at 105°C for 4 h and then diluted 10 times by volume with ultrapure water. The phosphorus concentration was determined using ICP-MS and calculated using the following algorithm: phosphorus concentration (ug/g DW) = ppb/(weigh ∗ 100).
For quantification of arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi colonized roots were stained with ink following the procedure: 10% KOH for 12 min at 95°C, rinsed by water and stained with Ink for 6 min at 95°C. The mycorrhizal colonization level was examined and quantified using a gridline intersect method as described ( Wang et al., 2014a 47. Wang, E. ∙ Yu, N. ∙ Bano, S.A. ... A H+-ATPase that energizes nutrient uptake during mycorrhizal symbioses in rice and Medicago truncatula Plant Cell. 2014; 26 :1818-1830 Crossref Scopus (131) PubMed Google Scholar ). For arbuscules structure images, mycorrhizal fungi colonized roots were stained with trypan blue following the procedure: 10% KOH for 30 min at 90°C, 10% H 2 O 2 for 10 min at room temperature and stained with trypan blue for 20 min at 90°C. Images were taken using a Zesis Axio Scope A1 microscope.
For gene editing in rice, target sequences were selected using the website ( http://crispr.hzau.edu.cn/CRISPR2/ ). For single-gene editing, the target sequences were synthesized and inserted into the sgRNA through BsaI site and then cloned into Ph-Ubi-cas9-7 vector using LR recombination reaction. For multiple genes editing, target sequences were synthesized and the CRISPR-Cas9 constructs were generated ( Ma et al., 2015 28. Ma, X. ∙ Zhang, Q. ∙ Zhu, Q. ... A robust CRISPR/Cas9 system for convenient, high-efficiency multiplex genome editing in monocot and dicot plants Mol. Plant. 2015; 8 :1274-1284 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1617) PubMed Google Scholar ). For overexpression in rice, Coding sequences of OsPHR1 , OsPHR2 , OsPHR3 , OsSPX1 and OsSPX2 were amplified and cloned into pDONR207 by BP recombination reaction. LR recombination reaction was performed to transfer the sequence to the modified pCAM1301. For promoter analysis, OsPT11 promoters with different deletion of P1BS were cloned into the modified plasmid pCAMBIA1300-GUS by using the HindIII and BamH1 . The constructs were introduced into Agrobacterium strain EHA105 and transferred to Nipponbare . Primers used for cloning are listed in Table S2 .
Promoters of AM-induced genes (1-3 kb upstream regions from the start codon) were amplified and cloned into pHISI-1 fused with HIS3 gene as a reporter. The AM-induced genes used for yeast one hybrid (Y1H) screening are listed in Table S2 . The constructs were linearized at the XhoI or AflII sites and integrated into the chromosome of bait yeast strain YM4271. The rice transcription factor (TF) library, which consisted of 1,570 rice transcription factors, was constructed by OE biotech (Shanghai) via cloning the full-length open reading frames of rice TFs into the pGADT7 vector fused in-frame with the GAL4 activation domain. The resulting constructs were transformed into Y187 competent yeast cells. The bait strain YM4271 and the prey strain Y187 were mated in 96-well plates and screened using the selective medium SD/-Leu/-His/3-AT (3-amino-1,2,4-triazole, 30-90 mM). The yeast clones that survived after selection were sequenced, and the correct clones were used in the second round of point-to-point validation. If colonies still survived on the second set of selective medium, we concluded that the TF was able to bind to the bait promoter. Primers sequences are described in Table S2 .
The Network was made using Cytoscape v.3.8.0 ( Shannon et al., 2003 41. Shannon, P. ∙ Markiel, A. ∙ Ozier, O. ... Cytoscape: a software environment for integrated models of biomolecular interaction networks Genome Res. 2003; 13 :2498-2504 Crossref Scopus (32512) PubMed Google Scholar ). The results of the yeast one hybrid assay were imported into the Cytoscape. The TF defined as “source node” and promoter defined as “target node.” For visualization, the yFiles organic layout algorithms was used and redeployed manually.
OsPHR1 , OsPHR2 and OsPHR3 coding sequences were amplified and cloned into pMAL-c2X vector for fusion with MBP tag at N terminus. MBP-OsPHR1, MBP-OsPHR2, MBP-OsPHR3 and MBP were expressed in the E. coli strain Rosetta (DE3) after induction with 0.5 mM IPTG (Isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside) for 20 hours at 16°C and purified using amylose resin (New England Biolabs). 200 bp promoter regions containing P1BS element of the target genes were end-labeled with CY5. 0.08 pmol labeled probes were incubated with 1 mg purified recombinant proteins in the 20 μL binding system (20 mM Tris-HCL. PH 7.9, 5% glycerol, 0.04 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mM MgCl 2 , 0.2 mM dithiothreitol, 40 mM KCL and 50 ng/μL deoxyribonucleic acid) at 25°C for 30 min. For competition assays, unlabeled competitors were added in the reaction at 10, 50 and 100 fold. Electrophoresis was performed with native 4% polyacrylamide gels in 0.5 × Tris-borate-EDTA for 90 min at 120 V in the dark at 4°C. The gels were scanned using an FLA-9000. Primers were listed in Table S2 .
For construction of the promoter-LUC vectors, 2-3kb promoter sequence of the target genes were amplified and inserted into the pLL00R vector. 35S-PHR2 and 35-SPX1 were created by cloning their corresponding coding sequence into JW771 vector and pUBGFP-3 × FLAG respectively. The empty vectors were used as a negative control. Agrobacterium tumefaciens GV3101 harboring the above constructs were cultured overnight at 28°C with constant shaking at 200 rpm. The Agrobacterium cells were collected by centrifugation at 4000 rpm, the supernatant was discarded and the pellet was resuspended in infiltration buffer (10 mM MES (PH 5.6), 10 mM MgCl 2 , 150 μM acetosyringone) at OD = 1.2. Subsequently, the Agrobacterium resuspensions were mixed in different combinations and adjusted to a final optical density of 0.3 for each Agrobacterium resuspension in the infiltration buffer. About 200-300 μL of infiltration mixtures was infiltrated into a circle area with 1.5 cm ( Figure 4 A) or 2.0 cm ( Figure 2 E) diameter of the abaxial side of expanded young N. benthamina leaves. After 36h infiltrated, the N. benthamina leaves were sprayed with luciferin and the luciferase signals were captured using a Tanon 5200 Image Analyzer. Luciferase intensity was quantified using ImageJ. The corresponding primers used for plasmid construction are in Table S2 .
The AM fungi colonized transgenic plant roots were soaked in the GUS staining buffer (10 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaH 2 PO 4 .H 2 O, 0.5 mM K 4 Fe(CN) 6 .3H 2 O, K 3 Fe(CN) 6 , 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.5 mM X-Gluc) follow by a vacuum treated for 20 min. Then the root samples were incubated at 37°C overnight. The staining was terminated by immerged the root samples into 50% ethanol. The GUS-stained roots were embedded in 4% (m/v) low-gelling temperature agarose and sectioned at 50 μm. For OsPT11-5 , the sectioned roots were immersed into 1 × phosphate buffered saline solution containing 0.2 μg/mL WGA-Alexa Fluor 488 overnight for WGA staining . Images were taken using a Zesis Axio Scope A1 microscope.
RNA in situ hybridization with digoxigenin-labeled sense and anti-sense probes was performed on 8-μm sections of mycorrhizal fungi colonized wild-type rice roots as described previously ( Dong et al., 2021 9. Dong, W. ∙ Zhu, Y. ∙ Chang, H. ... An SHR-SCR module specifies legume cortical cell fate to enable nodulation Nature. 2021; 589 :586-590 Crossref Scopus (94) PubMed Google Scholar ). OsPHR2 transcripts were generated from cDNA fragments corresponding to nucleotides 193–1171 of the coding sequence. Sections hybridized with sense or anti-sense probes were observed under the same conditions.
Total RNA was extracted from 100 mg well-grounded root tissue of each sample using Trizol reagent. Reverse transcription was carried out with 1 μg of total RNA by using PrimeScript RT Reagent Kit (Takara Bio) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. qRT-PCR was performed using a Bio-Rad CFX Connect real-time detection system and the SYBR Green PCR Mastermix (Genstar). For the gene expression analysis, the relative transcript levels of three technical repeats per sample were normalized to the geometric mean of amplification of three housekeeping genes: OsCyclophilin2 (LOC_Os02 g02890), OsActin (LOC_Os03 g50885) and OsGAPDH (LOC_Os08 g03290).
2 -ρCt was used to analyze the data. The primers used for qRT-PCR are listed in Table S2 .
Roots of AM colonized and non-colonized Nipponbare and Osphr2-1 mutant were harvested after six weeks post inoculation and powdered in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was isolated by using Trizol reagent. RNA quality and integrity were measured using agarose gel electrophoresis. For each sample, three biological replicates were used for RNA sequencing. RNA sequencing and data analysis were performed by Shanghai HanYu Biotech lab.
For RNA-seq library preparation and sequencing, RNA was purified with Dynabeads® Oligo (dT)25 (Thermo, USA) after treated with DNaseI (Takara, Japan). 100ng RNA per sample was used for libraries preparation generated using NEBNext® UltraTM RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB, USA). After cluster generation on a cBot cluster generation system using Truseq PE Cluster kit (Illumina, USA), the prepared libraries were sequenced on Illumina Nova, resulting in paired-end reads.
Raw data (raw reads) in FASTQ format were processed using Trimmomatic v0.32 to remove reads containing poly-N and low-quality reads to obtain clean reads. Then clean reads were mapped to the Oryza sativa Nipponbare reference genome ( https://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/ ) using bowtie2 v2.1.0. The expression levels of genes were calculated in FPKM (Fragment Per Kilobase of gene per Million reads mapped). Differentially expressed genes were identified using the P package DEGseq v1.20.0. Genes with log2 fold change greater than 1 or less than −1 and adjusted p value lower than 0.001 were classified as differential expressed genes.
The data that support the findings of this study have been deposited into CNGB Sequence Archive (CNSA) of China National GeneBank DataBase (CNGBdb) with accession number CNP0002086.
Coding sequence of OsSPX1/2/3/4/5/6 and OsPHR2 (691-1281 bp) were cloned into pGADT7 and pGBKT7 modified vectors respectively and co-transformed into AH109 strains using the lithium acetate/single-stranded carrier DNA/polyethylene glycol transformation method ( Gietz and Woods, 2002 15. Gietz, R.D. ∙ Woods, R.A. Transformation of yeast by lithium acetate/single-stranded carrier DNA/polyethylene glycol method Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350 :87-96 Crossref Scopus (2242) PubMed Google Scholar ). After 2-3 days growth in 28°C incubator, 10 μL of yeast suspension was dropped onto medium lacking leucine/tryptophan (-L/W) and leucine/tryptophan/adenine/histidine (-L/W/A/H). Interactions were determined based on the growth of yeast on the selected medium. Photos of yeast growth were taken using a camera (Nikon, D7100). Primers are listed in Table S2 .
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was performed as previous described by ( Saleh et al., 2008 39. Saleh, A. ∙ Alvarez-Venegas, R. ∙ Avramova, Z. An efficient chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) protocol for studying histone modifications in Arabidopsis plants Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3 :1018-1025 Crossref Scopus (476) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, roots of OsPHR2-FLAG transgenic plants were harvest after 6 weeks inoculation with AM fungi, cut into small pieces and cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde. After quenching the reaction by 0.25 M glycine solution, the roots were ground into fine powder and the nuclei was isolated. The chromatin was sonicated and the majority of the DNA fragments has a size between 200 and 800 bp. After centrifugation, the sonicated chromatin supernatant was diluted to 1 mL and divided into two equal aliquots. 5 μL IgG (Abmart) or 5 μL anti-Flag (sigma) antibody was added into the diluted chromatin and incubated overnight at 4°C. Next, 20 μL of protein A and protein G beads mixture (1:1 in volume) was added to each tube and incubated for two hours. After incubation, beads were washed several times with different solution according to Saleh et al., 2008 and eluted. The eluates were de-crosslinked by adding 20 μL of 5 M NaCl and the DNA was purified. The immunoprecipitated DNA was resuspended in 150 μL ddH 2 O. 3 μL of the purified DNA from input and ChIP samples were used as template for real-time PCR and three technical replicates were utilized for each sample. qPCR was performed using a Bio-Rad CFX Connect real-time detection system and the SYBR Green Premix Ex Taq (Takara Bio). Primers used are listed in Table S2 .
To analyze OsPHR2-FLAG protein level in rice, total protein was prepared from the top second leaf of ProUbi:OsPHR2-FLAG/Osphr2-1 and Osphr2-1 mutant plants. To analyze OsPHR2-FLAG and OsSPX1-FLAG protein accumulation in different combinations of transactive assay in N. benthamiana leaves, an equal amount of leaves were collected at 36 h after infiltration. For protein extraction, the collected samples were ground in liquid nitrogen and total protein was extracted using 5% (m/v) SDS solution at a ratio of 1:1 (v/v). Sample were inoculated for 10 min at room temperature and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min. Then the supernatant was transferred to a new tube and used for gel electrophoresis. OsPHR2-FLAG and OsSPX1-FLAG fusion protein were detected by western blot using Anti-flag antibody (Sigma, F1804). Same sample was detected using Anti-actin antibody (Abmart, M20009) as a loading control. Target bands were visualized using a Tanon 5200 Image Analyzer.
The corresponding genes in rice were used as queries to identify their orthologs in Populus trichocarpa , Glycine max , Zea mays , Arabidopsis thaliana, Medicago truncatula, Lotus japonica and Sorghum bicolor with BLASTP in miyakogusa.jp 3.0 ( https://www.kazusa.or.jp/lotus/ ), ensemblPlants ( http://plants.ensembl.org/index.html ) and rice genome annotation project ( https://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/ ). All the amino acid sequences were aligned using ClustalX2. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using the Maximum Likelihood method in MEGA6.0 with 1000 bootstrap repetitions.
The PHR2-binding sites (PIBS, GNATATNC) were identified in the 3000 bp upstream sequences of the differential expressed genes (DEGs, n = 3635) respond to AM colonization in O. sativa ( Table S4 ). We found a considerable over-representation of PHR2 target genes among the DEGs (1515 versus 794 expected, p < 0.0001, Fisher’s exact test). Moreover, the DEGs respond to AM colonization in O. sativa was also subjected to the PlantRegMap database ( Tian et al., 2020 45. Tian, F. ∙ Yang, D.-C. ∙ Meng, Y.-Q. ... PlantRegMap: charting functional regulatory maps in plants Nucleic Acids Res. 2020; 48 :D1104-D1113 PubMed Google Scholar ) for transcription factor binding site enrichment analysis. We found that the binding sites of 75 YAM transcription factors are overrepresented in these DEGs. Genes that harbor a P1BS element in their promoter were classified as OsPHR1/2/3 directly regulated genes. Genes that contain a binding site of a transcription factor that is directly regulated by OsPHR1/2/3 were classified as indirectly regulated. The transcription factors-promoter networks identified based on the above two methods were combined and visualized using Cytoscape v.3.8.0. To reduce the complexity of network, only nodes with a degree larger than the average number of neighbors of the network were visualized.
For GO enrichment analysis, the transcription factors in YAM were submitted to Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analyses on the PlantGSEA platform ( Yi et al., 2013 60. Yi, X. ∙ Du, Z. ∙ Su, Z. PlantGSEA: a gene set enrichment analysis toolkit for plant community Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41 :W98-103 Crossref Scopus (205) PubMed Google Scholar ) to identify over-represented biological processes. For YAM nodes expression pattern analysis, genes expression levels in mycorrhizal colonized (+AM) and non-colonized (-AM) conditions were obtain using RNA-seq; genes expression levels in phosphate deficient (-Pi) and sufficient (+Pi) were based on previously reported RNA-seq data ( Secco et al., 2013 40. Secco, D. ∙ Jabnoune, M. ∙ Walker, H. ... Spatio-temporal transcript profiling of rice roots and shoots in response to phosphate starvation and recovery Plant Cell. 2013; 25 :4285-4304 Crossref Scopus (255) PubMed Google Scholar ). The different tissues expressed genes were downloaded from the Expression Atlas ( https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/home ). The expression levels (FPKM) of the YAM nodes are listed in Table S3 .
Quantification of luciferase intensity was conducted by ImageJ software. For mycorrhizal colonization quantification, data are presented as mean ± s.e.m. For luciferase intensity and genes expression, data are presented as mean ± s.d. The number of samples and replicates is indicated in the legends. Statistically significant difference between control and experimental groups were determined by one way ANOVA (Duncan’s multiple range test; p < 0.05) and Two-sided Students’ t test ( ∗ , p < 0.05 ∗∗ ; p < 0.01; ns, not significant). Mycorrhizal inoculation of OsEIL2 RNAi, Oseil1-1 ( mhz6-1 ) and Oseil1- 3 ( mhz6-3 ) were performed simultaneously, thus the same wild-type control was used in Figures 1 C and S2 E. Mycorrhizal inoculation of Osram1-1 , Osram1-2 and OsPHR1 OE were performed simultaneously, thus the same wild-type control was used in Figures 1 E and S5 H.
