Title: Personalized microbiome-driven effects of non-nutritive sweeteners on human glucose tolerance


Abstract: Summary

Non-nutritive sweeteners (NNS) are commonly integrated into human diet and presumed to be inert; however, animal studies suggest that they may impact the microbiome and downstream glycemic responses. We causally assessed NNS impacts in humans and their microbiomes in a randomized-controlled trial encompassing 120 healthy adults, administered saccharin, sucralose, aspartame, and stevia sachets for 2 weeks in doses lower than the acceptable daily intake, compared with controls receiving sachet-contained vehicle glucose or no supplement. As groups, each administered NNS distinctly altered stool and oral microbiome and plasma metabolome, whereas saccharin and sucralose significantly impaired glycemic responses. Importantly, gnotobiotic mice conventionalized with microbiomes from multiple top and bottom responders of each of the four NNS-supplemented groups featured glycemic responses largely reflecting those noted in respective human donors, which were preempted by distinct microbial signals, as exemplified by sucralose. Collectively, human NNS consumption may induce person-specific, microbiome-dependent glycemic alterations, necessitating future assessment of clinical implications.

Section: Introduction

Over the past 4 decades, the global prevalence of overweight, obesity, and hyperglycemia has markedly increased in both children and adults, constituting a considerable health threat due to the association of these conditions with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease ( NCD Risk Factor Collaboration, 2017; Sarwar et al., 2010 32.

Imes, C.C. ∙ Burke, L.E. The obesity epidemic: the United States as a cautionary tale for the rest of the world Curr. Epidemiol. Rep. 2014; 1 :82-88 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). As sugar consumption is strongly associated with weight gain ( Hu, 2013 50. Hu, F.B. Resolved: there is sufficient scientific evidence that decreasing sugar-sweetened beverage consumption will reduce the prevalence of obesity and obesity-related diseases Obes. Rev. 2013; 14 :606-619 Crossref Scopus (612) PubMed Google Scholar ), one of the most common dietary strategies in combating obesity and hyperglycemia involves dietary sugar replacement with non-nutritive sweeteners (NNS), such as saccharin, sucralose, aspartame, acesulfame-K, and stevia, that do not contain calories and are thereby presumed to be inert and not elicit a postprandial glycemic response. This strategy is immensely popular. In a survey conducted between 2009 and 2011, 25.1% of children and 41.4% of adults in the United States reported consuming NNS, a marked increase compared with 1999 ( Sylvetsky et al., 2017a 124.

Diet. 2017; 117 :441-448.e2 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (132) PubMed Google Scholar ). Over 50% of children reported consumption of NNS in a multi-national study ( Katzmarzyk et al., 2016 57.

Nonetheless, the efficacy of this strategy remains uncertain.

Nutr. 2018; 108 :485-491 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ) counterintuitively suggest that NNS may even contribute to the obesity and diabetes pandemic in some contexts. As many of the studies associating NNS with negative impacts on human health are observational, it is often difficult to interpret their findings due to reverse causality (i.e., whether NNS cause weight gain and hyperglycemia, or alternatively whether individuals with these conditions consume NNS). The heterogeneity in outcomes and methodology between RCTs further complicates interpretation. In the absence of strong evidence for causality and a clear mechanism demonstrating how “metabolically inert” substances can affect human metabolism, consumption of NNS is still widely endorsed by clinicians and dietitians for adults ( Gardner et al., 2012 40. Gardner, C. ∙ Wylie-Rosett, J. ∙ Gidding, S.S. ...

To partially circumvent the limitations of human studies, feeding trials in animals are commonly used to causally link NNS intake with an effect on cardiometabolic diseases. However, although animal studies are less heterogeneous than human RCTs, some reported an adverse impact of NNS on metabolic health ( Abou-Donia et al., 2008 1.

This noted and often confusing heterogeneity between trials could potentially be resolved through consideration of the gut microbiome. The human gastrointestinal tract harbors trillions of microorganisms that play critical roles in multiple aspects of human physiology and pathologies, including cardiometabolic health ( Fan and Pedersen, 2021 33.

Artificial sweeteners induce glucose intolerance by altering the gut microbiota Nature. 2014; 514 :181-186 Crossref Scopus (1108) PubMed Google Scholar ), providing a possible causal link between NNS, microbiome, and metabolic health of the host. Although a small pilot study in humans suggested that the microbiome may constitute a potential determinant of a negative effect of saccharin on glycemic response in some individuals ( Suez et al., 2014 117.

Artificial sweeteners induce glucose intolerance by altering the gut microbiota Nature. 2014; 514 :181-186 Crossref Scopus (1108) PubMed Google Scholar ), there is a dearth of evidence on the effects of NNS on the human microbiome, and the few available studies are inconclusive, with some suggesting an effect ( Frankenfeld et al., 2015 37.

Nutr. 2019; 122 :856-862 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Notably, most of these studies were limited in their ability to screen and exclude individuals already incorporating NNS into their diets, and their microbiome was profiled using 16S rRNA gene sequencing or qPCR of target microbes, which may lack sufficient resolution to determine functional and species-level effects of NNS on the microbiome.
Here, we present the result of a multi-arm RCT assessing NNS effects on human metabolic health and the microbiome. We demonstrate that both sucralose and saccharin supplementation impairs glycemic responses in strictly non-NNS-consuming healthy volunteers, an effect that is not observed in non-supplemented control groups. Four different NNS functionally alter the microbiome. Importantly, by performing extensive fecal transplantation of human microbiomes into GF mice, we demonstrate a causal and individualized link between NNS-altered microbiomes and glucose intolerance developing in non-NNS-consuming recipient mice.

Section: Results

The trial featured four NNS intervention arms: aspartame, saccharin, sucralose, and stevia. All NNS were given as commercially available sachets containing glucose as a bulking agent (2 sachets/3 times a day), corresponding to 8%, 20%, 34%, and 75% of the acceptable daily intake (ADI) of each of the supplemented NNS, respectively (US Food and Drug Administration, 2018) 134. US Food and Drug Administration Additional information about high-intensity sweeteners permitted for use in food in the United States Food Additives and Petitions. 2018; Google Scholar ( Figures 1 A–1C, STAR Methods ). To control for the potential confounding effect of the glucose vehicle, routinely incorporated into the sachet mixtures, we supplemented participants in a fifth arm with an equivalent amount of glucose (5 g day −1 ). A sixth group did not receive any supplement (no supplement control, NSC). The study consisted of three phases: 7 days of baseline measurements of metabolic, metabolomic, and microbial parameters were followed by 14 days of exposure to the various nutritional interventions, after which supplementation was ceased and participants were followed up for 7 additional days. To determine the effect of NNS on glycemic control, participants wore a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) throughout the 29 days of the trial, and glucose tolerance tests were performed on pre-determined days. Anthropometrics and blood tests were conducted on days 0, 14, and 28. Microbiome samples from the stool and the oral cavity were collected at pre-determined time points. Participants logged all food intake and physical activity in real time using a dedicated smartphone application. The study design is summarized in Figure 1 A.
Between 2018 and 2020, we screened 1,375 individuals for eligibility (see exclusion criteria in STAR Methods ). A unique feature of the trial consisted of inclusion only of participants defined as complete NNS abstainers according to a detailed food frequency questionnaire based on NNS-containing products on the Israeli market ( STAR Methods ). Indeed, using the stringent screening protocol, the vast majority of ineligible candidates were found to consume NNS, in many cases unknowingly, in line with a similar finding in a US cohort ( Sylvetsky et al., 2017b 125. Sylvetsky, A.C. ∙ Walter, P.J. ∙ Garraffo, H.M. ... Widespread sucralose exposure in a randomized clinical trial in healthy young adults Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 2017; 105 :820-823 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ). A total of 120 participants, 20 in each group, successfully completed the trial and had enough glucose measurements for analysis (for the consolidated standards of reporting trials [CONSORT] participants flow diagram, see Figure 1 B and STAR Methods ). Table S1 shows the baseline characteristics of the cohort and each group. Participants in all groups were in good metabolic health, featuring normal body mass index (BMI), waist-hip ratio, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), C-reactive protein (CRP), total and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, blood pressure, heart rate, serum alanine transaminase (ALT), and aspartate transaminase (AST). 65% of participants were women, and the median age was 29.95 (interquartile range [IQR] 26.93–35.23). None of the following covariates was significant in any of the groups: age, sex, BMI, smoking, and habitual diet ( Table S2 ).
As a standardized measure of glucose tolerance, all participants performed oral glucose tolerance tests (GTT) with 50 g of glucose consumed in the morning after an overnight fasting on pre-determined days, twice during weeks 1, 2, and 4, and 3 times on week 3 (a total of 9 GTTs). GTTs were performed by participants at home, and the CGM recorded interstitial glucose every 15 min, after which the incremental area under the glucose curve (iAUC) was calculated. Performing GTTs using continuous glucose monitoring at home (rather than inviting the participants to perform the GTT at the testing center) enabled to longitudinally assess the effect of acute NNS consumption and reduce noise ( Bailey et al., 2014 9. Bailey, T.S. ∙ Ahmann, A. ∙ Brazg, R. ... Accuracy and acceptability of the 6-day Enlite continuous subcutaneous glucose sensor Diabetes Technol. Ther. 2014; 16 :277-283 Crossref Scopus (65) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although considerable person-to-person heterogeneity was observed in the GTT-iAUC (range 1,225–7,458 mg dL −1 min −1 ), baseline GTTs performed by the same individual were similar and significantly correlated with each other (Spearman r = 0.44, p < 0.0001, Figure 1 D), in line with previous findings ( Zeevi et al., 2015 146. Zeevi, D. ∙ Korem, T. ∙ Zmora, N. ... Personalized nutrition by prediction of glycemic responses Cell. 2015; 163 :1079-1094 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1205) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The effects of the NNS and controls on glucose tolerance are summarized in Figure 2 . To consider each individual GTT, we used two linear-mixed-effects models (LMMs) to assess the impact of NNS consumption over time, either with the seven GTTs performed during baseline and exposure weeks (model A) or all GTTs including follow-up (model B; Figure 2 A). Both saccharin and sucralose significantly elevated glycemic response during exposure (model A) compared with glucose vehicle (p = 0.042 and 0.004, respectively) and NSC (p = 0.018 and 0.001; Figure 2 A). The significant effect on GTT-iAUC was largely limited to the exposure period (model B saccharin versus glucose p = 0.18 and versus NSC p = 0.21; model B sucralose versus glucose p = 0.051 and versus NSC p = 0.059). Aspartame and stevia did not show a significant effect in both models. Importantly, no significant effect on glucose tolerance was observed in the glucose vehicle or NSC groups ( Figure 2 A; Table S2 ). To compare the magnitude of the effect between groups, we normalized the iAUC-GTT of each individual with their average baseline iAUC-GTT. During the 1st week of exposure, the normalized glycemic response was significantly higher in the sucralose group compared with the glucose vehicle ( Figure 2 B, two-way ANOVA & Dunnett p = 0.037) and the NSC groups ( Figure 2 B, p = 0.047) and in the saccharin group compared with the glucose vehicle group ( Figure 2 B, p = 0.023). The significantly elevated glycemic response persisted during the 2nd week of exposure compared with either glucose vehicle ( Figure 2 C, saccharin p = 0.047, sucralose p = 0.017) or NSC ( Figure 2 C, saccharin p = 0.003, sucralose p = 0.002) but declined toward baseline during follow-up ( Figure 2 D). Importantly, despite considerable inter-individual heterogeneity of glycemic responses, there were no significant differences in GTT-iAUCs between the groups at baseline (one-way repeated-measures ANOVA F = 0.67, p = 0.64). As an additional output, we compared each individual with their own baseline (repeated-measures two-way ANOVA & Dunnett’s). Saccharin significantly elevated glycemic response, starting from the 1st week of exposure ( Figure 2 E, p = 0.0073, iAUC mean difference 783.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 204.3–1,363) and persisting to the 2nd week of exposure (p = 0.0094, mean 811.2, CI 190.6–1,432). These differences abated upon cessation of saccharin intake (p = 0.39). Sucralose supplementation likewise resulted in significantly elevated glycemic response during week 1 ( Figure 2 F, p = 0.018, mean 855.8, CI 134.8–1,577) and week 2 (p = 0.0092, mean 976.3, CI 231.3–1,721), which did not persist in the follow-up week (p = 0.34). In contrast, neither aspartame ( Figure 2 G) nor stevia ( Figure 2 H) had a significant effect on glucose tolerance during the 1st (p = 0.9 and 0.47, respectively) and 2nd (p = 0.99 and 0.78, respectively) exposure weeks, or during follow-up (p = 0.32 and 0.99, respectively). No significant effect on glucose tolerance was observed in the glucose vehicle group ( Figure 2 I, week 1, p = 0.62, week 2, p = 0.85, follow-up, p = 0.33) or the NSC group ( Figure 2 J, p = 0.77, 0.41, and 0.11). The lack of significant effect in these control groups indicates that reduced glucose tolerance in the saccharin and sucralose groups is not a result of daily supplementation with a glucose-containing mixture (as glucose quantity is comparable between the vehicle and NNS groups, STAR Methods ) or the experimental protocol, which was identical in all groups (i.e., nine GTTs performed during the 29 days trial in all participants). Taken together, these findings indicate that short-term consumption of sucralose and saccharin in doses lower than the ADI can impact glycemic responses in healthy individuals.
In addition to a standardized GTT, we sought to determine whether NNS supplementation also affected daily fluctuations in glucose levels as an additional clinically-relevant parameter of glucose homeostasis. The daily coefficient of variance (CoV) in glucose as derived from the CGM indicated higher variability in the saccharin (linear-mixed-effects regression calculated on all days p = 0.0003, Figure S1 A) and stevia (p = 0.005, Figure S1 B) groups, but not in the sucralose ( Figure S1 C) or aspartame ( Figure S1 D) groups, compared with NSC. However, this was likely due to lower variability in the NSC group (p = 0.07 versus glucose vehicle), and none of the NNS groups was significantly different than the glucose vehicle group ( Figures S1 A–S1D). As both saccharin and sucralose demonstrated a cohort-wide effect on glucose tolerance, we asked whether the elevated glycemia associated with their intake is due to NNS effects on glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) or insulin production. Although participants in the NNS and the glucose vehicle groups were all exposed to an equivalent amount of glucose, a significant increase in plasma insulin during exposure was noted in the glucose vehicle group (mean 7.27 mU L −1 , 0.14–14.4, two-way ANOVA & Dunnett p = 0.045, Figure S1 E), which remained elevated on the last day of the trial (10.27 mU L −1 , 3.4–17.1, p = 0.004, Figure S1 E) and during exposure in the stevia group (6.38 mU L −1 , 0.19–12.58, p = 0.043, Figure S1 E). However, there were no significant changes in blood insulin in the saccharin, sucralose, aspartame, or NSC groups ( Figure S1 E). GLP-1 levels were not significantly altered in any of the groups ( Figure S1 F). None of the measured anthropometrics (BMI, waist and hip circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and resting heart rate) or blood markers (blood pressure, HbA1c, C-reactive protein, ALT, AST, and blood immune cell counts, see STAR Methods for full list) were significantly impacted (following Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple hypothesis testing) by NNS supplementation compared with the control groups ( Table S1 ).
To determine whether supplementation with sweeteners affected participant nutrient intake or physical activity, participants in the study logged their meals and activities in real time throughout the 4-week trial period. Although all participants modestly reduced their energy intake throughout the trial, regardless of the group ( Table S3 ), likely due to the established effect of heightened awareness ( Robinson et al., 2015 104. Robinson, E. ∙ Hardman, C.A. ∙ Halford, J.C.G. ... Eating under observation: a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effect that heightened awareness of observation has on laboratory measured energy intake Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 2015; 102 :324-337 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), there were no significant differences in nutrient (carbohydrates, sugar, fiber, protein, fat, and cholesterol) intake or physical activity between the groups ( Table S3 ). It is therefore unlikely that the differences in glycemic responses stem from differential intake of calories or macronutrients or physical activity.
One of the mechanisms through which NNS can affect human metabolism may involve alteration of the intestinal microbiome. Evidence for this mechanism stems mostly from animal models, whereas evidence in humans is limited and conflicted ( Harrington et al., 2022 47. Harrington, V. ∙ Lau, L. ∙ Crits-Christoph, A. ... Interactions of non-nutritive artificial sweeteners with the microbiome in metabolic syndrome Immunometabolism. 2022; 4 :e220012 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Importantly, as previous studies utilized 16S rDNA microbiome profiling, the effect of NNS on species-level abundance and functional capacity of the microbial community remains elusive. We therefore collected longitudinal stool samples from all participants throughout the baseline, exposure, and follow-up phases and performed shotgun metagenomic sequencing (n = 1,182 stool samples after quality filtration, STAR Methods ).
Baseline stool microbiome composition and function were comparable between the NNS (aspartame, sucralose, saccharin, and stevia) and control groups (glucose vehicle, NSC, and PERMANOVA p > 0.05, Table S4 ). To determine whether NNS supplementation had an effect on the microbiome’s temporal dynamics, we performed a trajectory analysis using M-product ( Kilmer et al., 2021 58. Kilmer, M.E. ∙ Horesh, L. ∙ Avron, H. ... Tensor-tensor algebra for optimal representation and compression of multiway data Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2021; 118 e2015851118 Crossref Scopus (7) PubMed Google Scholar ) based tensor component analysis (TCAM, Mor et al., 2022 85. Mor, U. ∙ Cohen, Y. ∙ Valdés-Mas, R. ... Dimensionality reduction of longitudinal ’omics data using modern tensor factorizations PLoS Comput Biol. 2022; 18 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; STAR Methods ) compared with the NSC group. This analysis was performed twice, using samples from individual sampling days as well as weekly averaged abundances per participant. A significant effect on the microbiome composition was observed in the sucralose (genus days PERMANOVA, p = 0.002, Figure 3 A; genus weeks, p = 0.011, Figure S2 A; species days, p = 0.033, Figure S2 B; species weeks, p = 0.012, Figure S2 C) and saccharin (genus days, p = 0.014, Figure 3 B; species days, p = 0.018, Figure S2 D) groups. All four NNS had a significant effect on microbiome function (sucralose weeks, p = 0.033, Figure 3 C; saccharin weeks, p = 0.023, Figure 3 D; saccharin days, p = 0.04. Figure S2 E; aspartame weeks, p = 0.014, Figure 3 E; aspartame days, p = 0.016, Figure S2 F; stevia weeks, p = 0.036, Figure 3 F; stevia days, p = 0.017, Figure S2 G), as well as KEGG modules in sucralose (days, p = 0.015, Figure S2 H). None of these microbiome features was significantly different between the glucose vehicle and the NSC groups ( Figures S2 I–S2O).
To determine the microbial features underlying these effects, we plotted the area under the log-fold change curve for the top loadings of each significant comparison. Several top loadings in the sucralose group were related to purine metabolism ( Figure 3 G). Top loadings for the saccharin group included pathways related to glycolysis and glucose degradation ( Figure 3 H). Many of the top loadings in the aspartame group were related to polyamines metabolism ( Figure 3 I). Several top loadings in the stevia group were related to fatty acid biosynthesis ( Figure 3 J). Collectively, these results suggest that dietary supplementation with NNS can impact the functional potential of the human microbiome in NNS-specific manners, with the most prominent effects on the fecal microbiome observed with sucralose.
Similarly, NNS distinctly impacted the oral microbiome (eight samples per participant throughout the trial, STAR Methods ). The relative abundance of four metabolism-related KEGG pathways ( Figures S3 A–S3D) and three modules ( Table S5 ) decreased during the 2nd week of exposure in the oral microbiome of the stevia group. Notable oral microbiome alterations (p < 0.1) in the other NNS groups include changes in relative abundances of six Streptococcus species in the sucralose group ( Figure S3 E; Table S6 ), reduced relative abundance of Fusobacterium in the saccharin group ( Figure S3 F; Table S5 ), and reduced abundance of Porphyromonas ( Figure S3 G) and Prevotella nanceiensis ( Figure S3 H) in the aspartame group ( Table S5 ). There were no oral microbiome alterations with an FDR-corrected p < 0.1 in either control group ( Table S6 ), and baseline oral microbiome composition and function were comparable between the NNS and control groups (PERMANOVA p > 0.05, Table S4 ).
We next sought to identify microbiome features that potentially contribute to the NNS effects noted on glycemic control and uncover putative host targets that may link these NNS-related functional microbiome alterations to an effect on the host. We initially focused on sucralose as this NNS is poorly absorbed and is more likely to interact with the intestinal microbiome. Furthermore, of the two NNS that significantly impacted glucose tolerance, the sucralose group displayed greater person-to-person heterogeneity, providing an opportunity to elucidate microbiome and metabolome contributions to personalized glycemic responses. First, we correlated the baseline abundance of stool bacterial genera and species, KEGG modules and pathways, and MetaCyc pathways with the GTT-iAUC measured during the 2nd week of sucralose exposure. We then assessed how the significantly correlated features (Pearson p < 0.05) changed throughout the trial ( Table S6 ). Significant metagenomic results included those strictly appearing in the sucralose group (n = 20), although not being altered in the glucose (n = 20) and NSC (n = 20) control groups. The plasma metabolome for sucralose consumers was profiled at baseline (day 0) and after the 1st week of NNS supplementation (day 14). Significant metabolomic results included those strictly appearing in the sucralose group (n = 20), although not being altered in the glucose (n = 10) and NSC (n = 10) control groups ( Table S6 ).
Baseline abundance of three bacterial species correlated with GTT-iAUC ( Figure 4 A). Functionally, the abundances of several purine biosynthesis pathways were positively associated with GTT-iAUC and gradually decreased during the trial. Mixed acid fermentation and the TCA cycle were also inversely correlated with GTT-iAUC; the abundances of these pathways increased during both exposure weeks and trended toward baseline during follow-up ( Figure 4 A). Nine metabolites significantly increased in plasma during sucralose supplementation and three decreased (FDR-corrected paired t test p < 0.05, Figures 4 B–4D). No significant changes were noted following FDR correction in plasma metabolites in the glucose vehicle and NSC groups ( Table S6 ). In line with the increased abundance of the TCA cycle pathway in the microbiome, the levels of iso-citrate and trans-aconitate, TCA cycle intermediates, increased in plasma during sucralose supplementation ( Figure 4 B). Levels of the amino acids serine, N -acetyl alanine, and aspartate, as well as the aspartate metabolite quinolinate, also increased during supplementation ( Figure 4 B). Two additional TCA cycle metabolites (citrate and fumarate) and several additional amino acids (cystine, lysine, and glycyl-L-valine) significantly increased during supplementation (before FDR correction, Table S6 ). In line with the reduction of microbial pathways related to purine metabolism, plasma levels of pseudouridine and uric acid were significantly reduced during sucralose supplementation ( Figure 4 D), as well as guanosine, 1-methylguanine, inosine, and paraxanthine (before FDR correction, Table S5 ).
In addition, 22 metabolites were significantly correlated with an increase in GTT-iAUC noted in the sucralose group, but not in the NSC or glucose vehicle group, including the SCFA propionate, butyrate, and valerate (before FDR correction, Table S6 ). Based on all of the above differentially abundant metabolites, we performed a pathway enrichment analysis which highlighted changes in amino acid metabolism and biosynthesis and the TCA cycle pathways to be associated with the impact of sucralose on glycemic control (FDR-corrected p < 0.05, Figure 4 E). To identify metabolites that may mediate responsiveness to sucralose and those that are potentially involved in sucralose effect on glucose tolerance, we next compared the metabolomic profiles of the top and bottom five sucralose responders. Three metabolites were significantly different between top and bottom responders (FDR-corrected two-way ANOVA p < 0.05, Figure 4 F): the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate, serine, and the cysteine derivate cysteate. All three were lowest in top sucralose responders at baseline and increased during supplementation. None of these metabolites was significantly different between the five top and bottom responders in the glucose and NSC control groups ( Table S6 ).
We similarly correlated the abundances of baseline metagenomic features with GTT-iAUC in the saccharin, stevia, and aspartame groups, as well as metabolomic profiles in the top 5 responders in each group. Significant metagenomic results included those strictly appearing in any of the saccharin, aspartame or stevia groups, although not being altered in the glucose and NSC control groups. The plasma metabolome for sucralose consumers was profiled at baseline (day 0), after the 1st week of NNS supplementation (day 14) and at end of the follow-up (day 28). Significant metabolomic results included those strictly appearing in the any of the saccharin, aspartame, or stevia groups, although not being altered in the respective glucose and NSC control groups. In the saccharin group, baseline levels of Prevotella copri and UMP biosynthesis were positively associated with GTT-iAUC and gradually increased during exposure, whereas baseline levels of Bacteroides xylanisolvens were negatively associated with GTT-iAUC and increased during exposure ( Figure 5 A). Many of the pathways negatively correlated with GTT-iAUC were related to glycolysis and glycan degradation ( Figure 5 A). Untargeted plasma metabolomics of the top five saccharin responders readily detected high levels of saccharin during exposure ( Figure 5 B). The plasma levels of indoxyl sulfate, a metabolite associated with vascular disease, increased during saccharin exposure ( Figure 5 B). Levels of the SCFA butyrate increased during the trial, whereas those of three long-chain fatty acids were reduced ( Figure 5 B; Table S5 ). In the stevia group, two Prevotella spp. were positively associated with GTT-iAUC, and reduced during exposure; Bacteroides coprophilus , Parabacteroides goldsteinii , and a Lachnospira spp., which were also positively associated with GTT-iAUC increased during both exposure weeks ( Figure 5 C). Stevioside was readily detected in plasma samples of the stevia group, exclusively during supplementation ( Figure 5 D). Levels of the amino acids serine and lysine increased during stevia supplementation ( Figure 5 D). Notably, two metabolites of arginine, ornithine and citrulline, also increased during exposure ( Figure 5 D). In the aspartame group, B. fragilis and B. acidifaciens were positively associated with GTT-iAUC, whereas B. coprocola had an inverse correlation ( Figure 5 E). Levels of kynurenine, a metabolite associated with diabetes, increased during aspartame consumption ( Figure 5 F). Collectively, human NNS supplementation induced distinct alterations in microbiome composition and function, as well as in distinct plasma metabolites, in each of the NNS-supplemented groups, which correlated with host glycemic responses. Notably, changes in abundance of many of the correlated microbiome or metabolome features start as early as the 1st week of exposure and revert to baseline during follow-up, suggesting that these bacterial species and functions may respond to the presence of NNS.
To determine whether the aforementioned alterations in human microbiome configuration causally contribute to NNS-induced hyperglycemia, we colonized adult GF mice with stool microbiome collected either at the beginning of the trial (day 1), or on the last day of exposure (day 21), from all four NNS-supplemented and control groups ( Figure S4 A). In total, we transplanted microbiomes from 42 individuals, the four individuals in each group that had the most potent response (“top responders”), and the three that had the lowest response (“bottom responders”) in their respective groups. Statistically, each individual donor was strictly treated as a random effect in the LMM while modeling the glycemic response variable. Strikingly, for each of the four “top responders” in the saccharin and sucralose groups, mice humanized with the day 21 sample had a significantly higher glycemic response compared with mice that received the baseline sample from the same individual (saccharin top 1-t test p = 0.0072, top 2 p = 0.025, top 3 p = 0.0046, top 4 p = 0.048, Figure S4 ; sucralose top 1 p = 0.025, top 2 p = 0.016, top 3 p = 0.043, top 4 p = 0.0031, Figure S5 ), resulting in a significant group effect for both saccharin ( Figure 6 A, mixed-effects ANOVA p < 0.0001) and sucralose ( Figure 6 B, p < 0.0001). Microbiomes transferred from the last day of exposure of the four “top responders” to stevia and aspartame resulted in elevated glycemic response in recipient mice of three out of the four top-responding donors (stevia p < 0.0001, p < 0.0001, p = 0.029; aspartame p = 0.012, 0.048, and 0.015, Figure S6 ), resulting in a significant group effect for both (stevia p < 0.0001, Figure 6 C; aspartame p = 0.0022, Figure 6 D). Importantly, none of the day 21 stool microbiome samples transferred into GF mice from the four “top responders” in the glucose vehicle or the NSC groups ( Figures 6 E and 6F; Figure S7 ) resulted in a significant effect on glucose tolerance, compared with baseline microbiome samples transferred from the same individuals. To further elucidate the extent of the causative personalized NNS-mediated effect size, we transplanted baseline and day 21 microbiomes from the bottom three responders in each group into GF mice. Interestingly, in the saccharin group, the last day of exposure microbiomes from the bottom three responders still elevated glycemic response in recipient GF mice ( Figure 6 G, p = 0.0003), in line with its strong cohort-wide elevated glycemia. No significant effects on glycemic response were observed with bottom responders from any of the other treatment (sucralose p = 0.23, Figure 6 H; stevia p = 0.96, Figure 6 I; aspartame p = 0.076, Figure 6 J) or control (glucose vehicle p = 0.97, Figure 6 K; NSC p = 0.058, Figure 6 L) groups, suggesting a personalized microbiome-mediated impact in response to NNS exposure in these groups. Collectively, the glycemic responses in the humanized mice largely reflected those of their NNS-supplemented donors and serve as a likely causal link between NNS-related microbiome modulations and disrupted glycemic control.
Finally, we compared fecal microbiome features potentially differentiating human top NNS responders (n = 4 in each NNS) and bottom responders (n = 3 in each NNS). In human participants, KEGG pathways Bray-Curtis-based dissimilarity to baseline configurations trended to be higher in top responders throughout the trial in the sucralose ( Figure S8 A), stevia ( Figure S8 B), and aspartame ( Figure S8 C) groups and were initially higher in bottom responders but converged in the saccharin group ( Figure S8 D). Importantly, top and bottom “responders” were comparable in the glucose vehicle and NSC groups ( Figures S8 E and S8F). The fold change between baseline and the 2nd week of exposure of pathways related to glycolysis and TCA cycle was higher in sucralose top responders compared with bottom responders ( Figure S8 G). Pathways related to biosynthesis, degradation and metabolism of purines and pyrimidines increased in top stevia responders ( Figure S8 H). Pathways related to the urea cycle and its metabolites increased in top aspartame responders, whereas Akkermansia muciniphila , associated with metabolic health of the host ( Cani et al., 2022 21. Cani, P.D. ∙ Depommier, C. ∙ Derrien, M. ... Akkermansia muciniphila: paradigm for next-generation beneficial microorganisms Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology. 2022; 1-13 PubMed Google Scholar ), increased in bottom responders ( Figure S8 I). Degradation of the cyclic amide caprolactam increased in saccharin top responders, suggesting a possible potential for degradation of chemically related saccharin. Biosynthesis of the branched-chain amino acid isoleucine, associated with poorer metabolic health ( Yu et al., 2021 144. Yu, D. ∙ Richardson, N.E. ∙ Green, C.L. ... The adverse metabolic effects of branched-chain amino acids are mediated by isoleucine and valine Cell metabolism. 2021; 33 :905-922 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), also increased in top saccharin responders ( Figure S8 J).
To further exemplify such personalized microbiome differences, we compared the fecal microbiome configurations of GF mouse groups transplanted with microbiomes of top (n = 3) and bottom (n = 3) human sucralose responders (n = 3, Figure 7 A), in which each of the top human donors and none of the bottom donors exhibited a significant difference in glycemic response between baseline and day 21 of the clinical trial ( Figure S5 ). GF mouse recipients of microbiomes from top sucralose human responders on day 21 featured a distinct microbiome configuration compared with GF mouse recipients of microbiome from bottom sucralose human responders on day 21 (Rcpt: D21, PERMANOVA with donor as random effect PC3 p = 0.008, Figure 7 B), in line with the differential glycemic responses noted in the human donors at day 21 time point ( Figure S5 ). Total 22 species and 19 pathways were differentially abundant between mouse recipients of microbiomes from top and bottom human sucralose responders on day 21, of which only two were also different at baseline (pyrimidine biosynthesis and tRNA charging, Table S7 ). The putrescine biosynthetic pathway was overrepresented in mice conventionalized with top responders’ day 21 samples (p < 0.0001); elevated plasma levels of putrescine were previously associated with type-2 diabetes ( Fernandez-Garcia et al., 2019 35. Fernandez-Garcia, J.C. ∙ Delpino-Rius, A. ∙ Samarra, I. ... Type 2 diabetes is associated with a different pattern of serum polyamines: a Case − Control study from the PREDIMED-Plus trial J. Clin. Med. 2019; 8 :71 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) and gestational diabetes ( Liu et al., 2021 68. Liu, C. ∙ Wang, Y. ∙ Zheng, W. ... Putrescine as a novel biomarker of maternal serum in first trimester for the prediction of gestational diabetes mellitus: A nested case-control study Front. Endocrinol. (Lausanne). 2021; 12 :759893 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Notably, transplantation of baseline microbiomes of top and bottom sucralose responders into GF mice resulted in comparable glucose tolerance in recipient mice (Rcpt: BL, Figure 7 C). Nonetheless, microbiome configurations of mice receiving baseline pre-exposure microbiomes from human top sucralose responders were already significantly different from those of recipients of baseline microbiomes from human bottom sucralose responders. Microbiome composition of mouse recipients of baseline samples of top and bottom human responders was significantly separated on PC3 (PERMANOVA with donor as random effect p = 0.008, Figure 7 D), and function was separated on PC5 (p = 0.008, Figure 7 E). The microbial features that potentially mediate these differences included 25 species and 27 pathways that are significantly (FDR-corrected linear-mixed model p < 0.05) differentially abundant between the two subsets ( Table S7 ). Pathways related to menaquinol biosynthesis, previously associated with type 1 ( Roth-Schulze et al., 2021 108. Roth-Schulze, A.J. ∙ Penno, M.A.S. ∙ Ngui, K.M. ... Type 1 diabetes in pregnancy is associated with distinct changes in the composition and function of the gut microbiome Microbiome. 2021; 9 :167 Crossref Scopus (7) PubMed Google Scholar ) and type 2 diabetes ( Balvers et al., 2021 11.

The gut microbiota in prediabetes and diabetes: a population-based cross-sectional study Cell Metab. 2020; 32 :379-390.e3 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (81) PubMed Google Scholar ), were the most overrepresented features in mouse recipients of baseline microbiomes from top responders (p = 0.0006, Figure 7 F). Pathways related to purine (p < 0.0001) and pyrimidine (p = 0.005) biosynthesis were more abundant in mouse recipients of baseline microbiomes of top responders, whereas purine degradation (p < 0.0001) was more abundant in recipients of baseline microbiomes from bottom responders ( Figure 7 F), in line with the correlation between purine biosynthesis and elevated glycemic response noted in the entire sucralose group ( Figure 4 A). Most pathways over-abundant in mouse recipients of baseline microbiomes from bottom responders were related to fatty acid biosynthesis (stearate biosynthesis p = 0.014, dodecanoate biosynthesis p < 0.0001, saturated fatty acid elongation p = 0.005, and phosphatidylglycerol biosynthesis p = 0.003) and their utilization for energy production and gluconeogenesis (glyoxylate bypass and TCA p < 0.0001) ( Figure 7 F). To identify microbial pathways that may predict the effect of sucralose on glucose tolerance, we correlated the baseline abundance of each pathway with the fold difference in the GTT AUC of recipient mice (day 21/baseline). Interestingly, the baseline abundance of the glycolysis pathway demonstrated a significant (FDR-corrected) and strong correlation with GTT-AUC (Spearman r = 1, p = 0.0028, Figure 7 G; Table S7 ). Collectively, these results suggest that a unique pre-supplementation baseline microbiome configuration may contribute to the personalized responses noted upon subsequent exposure to sucralose.
To further identify microbiome functions potentially linked to alterations in glucose tolerance in recipient mice of top and bottom sucralose-responder human microbiomes, we compared microbiome profiles of mouse recipients of top and bottom human sucralose responders collected on day 21 with those in mice receiving baseline pre-exposure samples from the same top and bottom sucralose-responsive humans. Indeed, mice receiving day 21 microbiome samples from top responders presented higher alpha diversity compared with those receiving baseline microbiomes from the same top responders or compared with mice receiving day 21 microbiomes from bottom responders (linear-mixed effects regression, p = 0.004; Figure 7 H). A comparison between the baseline and day 21 mouse recipient microbiomes revealed 13 pathways significantly altered in the top responders’ group and none in the bottom responder mice. All significantly altered pathways were less abundant on day 21 compared with baseline ( Figure 7 I; Table S7 ). Pathways related to the biosynthesis of fatty acids, already less abundant in mouse recipients of baseline top responder microbiomes compared with mouse recipients of baseline bottom responder microbiomes, became undetectable in mice transplanted with day 21 top responder microbiome (p = 0.012). The fold increase of two pathways (day 21/baseline abundance) was significantly correlated with an increased glycemic response: sucrose degradation (Spearman r = −1, p = 0.0028, Figure 7 J) and glycogen degradation (Spearman r = 1, p = 0.0028, Figure 7 K). Taken together, these results suggest that the ability of the microbiome to respond to sucralose in altering host glucose tolerance may be mediated, at least in part, by the capacity of the bacteria to metabolize dietary and/or host-derived carbohydrates and utilize them for energy production. These results merit future causative validation in future studies.

Section: Discussion

Our work provides evidence of human microbiome responsiveness to NNS and its ability to transmit, in specific configurations, downstream effects on the host glucose tolerance. As such, and in contrast to the common notion suggesting that NNS are metabolically inert, these data suggest that the human gut microbiome may constitute a “responsiveness hub” enabling, in some individuals, the transmission of NNS effects on human physiology. Similarly, other “modern” food additives such as dietary emulsifiers ( Chassaing et al., 2015 23. Chassaing, B. ∙ Koren, O. ∙ Goodrich, J.K. ... Dietary emulsifiers impact the mouse gut microbiota promoting colitis and metabolic syndrome Nature. 2015; 519 :92-96 Crossref Scopus (1003) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tang et al., 2013 126.

Med. 2013; 368 :1575-1584 Crossref Scopus (1885) PubMed Google Scholar ), food preservatives ( Tirosh et al., 2019 129. Tirosh, A. ∙ Calay, E.S. ∙ Tuncman, G. ... The short-chain fatty acid propionate increases glucagon and FABP4 production, impairing insulin action in mice and humans Sci. Transl. Med. 2019; 11 Crossref Scopus (105) PubMed Google Scholar ), and colorants ( He et al., 2021 48. He, Z. ∙ Chen, L. ∙ Catalan-Dibene, J. ... Food colorants metabolized by commensal bacteria promote colitis in mice with dysregulated expression of interleukin-23 Cell Metab. 2021; 33 :1358-1371.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (10) PubMed Google Scholar ) have been suggested to impact the microbiome and, in some cases, mediate downstream host metabolic effects. Interestingly, although the small amount of vehicle glucose incorporated into the NNS sachets and consumed by all participants in the NNS groups was comparable to the amount of glucose consumed by participants in the vehicle group, plasma insulin levels rose during supplementation only in the stevia and glucose vehicle groups. These results suggest a possible blunting of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, leading to elevated glycemia in participants consuming saccharin or sucralose (with glucose as a vehicle). Notably, coupling of NNS with a caloric sweetener was reported to result in a higher insulin response compared with NNS alone ( Dalenberg et al., 2020 28. Dalenberg, J.R. ∙ Patel, B.P. ∙ Denis, R. ... Short-term consumption of sucralose with, but not without, carbohydrate impairs neural and metabolic sensitivity to sugar in humans Cell Metab. 2020; 31 :493-502.e7 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ). The putative impacts of NNS on insulin sensitivity with and without a carbohydrate moiety should be addressed in further studies under glucose challenge conditions.
Notably, all four tested NNS (saccharin, sucralose, aspartame, and stevia) significantly and distinctly altered the human intestinal and oral microbiome, as would be expected for these chemically diverse compounds. Such an effect was not observed in the two control groups. Sucralose ( Olivier-Van Stichelen et al., 2019 91. Olivier-Van Stichelen, S. ∙ Rother, K.I. ∙ Hanover, J.A. Maternal exposure to non-nutritive sweeteners impacts progeny’s metabolism and microbiome Front. Microbiol. 2019; 10 :1360 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ; Uebanso et al., 2017 133. Uebanso, T. ∙ Ohnishi, A. ∙ Kitayama, R. ... Effects of low-dose non-caloric sweetener consumption on gut microbiota in mice Nutrients. 2017; 9 :560 Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ), saccharin ( Serrano et al., 2021 113. Serrano, J. ∙ Smith, K.R. ∙ Crouch, A.L. ... High-dose saccharin supplementation does not induce gut microbiota changes or glucose intolerance in healthy humans and mice Microbiome. 2021; 9 :11 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ), and stevia metabolites ( Wheeler et al., 2008 139. Wheeler, A. ∙ Boileau, A.C. ∙ Winkler, P.C. ... Pharmacokinetics of rebaudioside A and stevioside after single oral doses in healthy men Food Chem. Toxicol. 2008; 46 :S54-S60 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) are found in stool of NNS-supplemented animals and humans, suggesting that direct interaction of these NNS with the intestinal microbiome is fully plausible. Sucralose is poorly absorbed, and thus, the majority of orally supplemented sucralose reaches the colon, and subsequently, most, but not all, is excreted unchanged in feces ( John et al., 2000 53.

The pharmacokinetics and metabolism of sucralose in the dog Food Chem. Toxicol. 2000; 38 :S99-S106 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). The metabolic fate of the remaining fraction is currently unknown, although sucralose-related metabolites of unknown function have been identified in feces and adipose tissue ( Bornemann et al., 2018 18.

The pharmacokinetics and metabolism of sucralose in the dog Food Chem. Toxicol. 2000; 38 :S99-S106 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), potentially underlying heterogeneity in metabolic responses to sucralose. Saccharin is slowly absorbed from the gut to the bloodstream, and a minority of ingested saccharin (5%–15%) is excreted in feces, mostly unchanged ( Ball et al., 1974 10. Ball, L.M. ∙ Renwick, A.G. ∙ Williams, R.T. The fate of [14C]saccharin in rats chronically fed on saccharin Biochem. Soc.

The pharmacokinetics of saccharin in man Xenobiotica. 1981; 11 :531-540 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ). The long absorption time and poor bioavailability support possible interactions with the microbiome. Degradation of steviol glycosides by gut bacteria is an established component of their metabolism ( Magnuson et al., 2016 72. Magnuson, B.A. ∙ Carakostas, M.C. ∙ Moore, N.H. ... Biological fate of low-calorie sweeteners Nutr. Rev. 2016; 74 :670-689 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), although some species may be more proficient than others in performing this task ( Gardana et al., 2003 39. Gardana, C. ∙ Simonetti, P. ∙ Canzi, E. ... Metabolism of stevioside and rebaudioside A from stevia rebaudiana extracts by human microflora J. Agric. Food Chem. 2003; 51 :6618-6622 Crossref Scopus (159) PubMed Google Scholar ), and thus, pre-exposure microbiome heterogeneity may conduce to differential responses to stevia. In contrast to sucralose, saccharin, and stevia, aspartame is metabolized by host enzymes in the proximal regions of the gastrointestinal tract ( Magnuson et al., 2016 72. Magnuson, B.A. ∙ Carakostas, M.C. ∙ Moore, N.H. ... Biological fate of low-calorie sweeteners Nutr. Rev. 2016; 74 :670-689 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, the mechanisms through which aspartame modulated the fecal microbiome of human participants in this study and in previous reports in animal models ( Nettleton et al., 2020 88.

NNS may impact gut commensals through several direct and indirect mechanisms, some highlighted by our study’s results. First, NNS may induce microbial growth inhibition, as was shown for cultured E. coli ( Harpaz et al., 2018 46. Harpaz, D. ∙ Yeo, L.P. ∙ Cecchini, F. ...

In the current study, sucralose exposure resulted in reduced abundance of nucleotide biosynthesis genes, which might be linked to inhibited bacterial replication. In contrast, the abundance of genes related to mixed-acid fermentation and TCA cycle increased during sucralose supplementation. TCA metabolites were also elevated in plasma during sucralose supplementation, suggestive of possible microbiome contributions. Elevated plasma levels of TCA metabolites has been associated with impaired glycemic control ( Fiehn et al., 2010 36. Fiehn, O. ∙ Garvey, W.T. ∙ Newman, J.W. ...

In addition, some bacterial species may bloom in the presence of NNS ( Palmnäs et al., 2014 94. Palmnäs, M.S.A. ∙ Cowan, T.E. ∙ Bomhof, M.R. ...

Bowel Dis. 2018; 24 :1005-1020 Crossref Scopus (91) PubMed Google Scholar ). Blooming may be mediated by an unoccupied niche, depleted of species inhibited by NNS. Alternatively, some gut bacteria can utilize NNS that reach the lower gut (e.g., saccharin and sucralose) as an energy or carbon source, thus gaining a growth advantage in their presence ( Schiffman and Rother, 2013 111. Schiffman, S.S. ∙ Rother, K.I. Sucralose, a synthetic organochlorine sweetener: overview of biological issues J. Toxicol. Environ. Health B Crit. Rev. 2013; 16 :399-451 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Such mechanism was mainly studied to date in environmental bacteria ( Labare and Alexander, 1995 62. Labare, M.P. ∙ Alexander, M. Microbial cometabolism of sucralose, a chlorinated disaccharide, in environmental samples Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1994; 42 :173-178 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ) or shown to exist in a single species in the presence of oxygen ( Schleheck and Cook, 2003 112. Schleheck, D. ∙ Cook, A.M. Saccharin as a sole source of carbon and energy for Sphingomonas xenophaga SKN Arch. Microbiol. 2003; 179 :191-196 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ). One hint for such a mechanism in our study relates to the detection of several metabolites in the plasma of saccharin-supplemented individuals that may stem from saccharin degradation. Exploring such degradation capacities merits future studies in gut-residing human commensals. Notably, NNS could potentially alter the microbiome through indirect, host-mediated effects. These include interaction between NNS and sweet and/or bitter taste receptors in the gut and downstream effects on the microbiome ( Turner et al., 2020 132. Turner, A. ∙ Veysey, M. ∙ Keely, S. ... Intense sweeteners, taste receptors and the gut microbiome: A metabolic health perspective Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health. 2020; 17 :4094 Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar ) and possible effects of NNS on the immune system ( Bian et al., 2017a 15. Bian, X. ∙ Tu, P. ∙ Chi, L. ...

Food Sci. 2019; 2019 :9619020 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ). These merit further study.
Collectively, our study suggests that commonly consumed NNS may not be physiologically inert in humans as previously contemplated, with some of their effects mediated indirectly through impacts exerted on distinct configurations of the human microbiome. We stress that these results should not be interpreted as calling for consumption of sugar, which is strongly linked to cardiometabolic diseases and other adverse health effects ( Malik and Hu, 2022; Vos et al., 2017 73.

Added sugars and cardiovascular disease risk in children: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association Circulation. 2017; 135 :e1017-e1034 Crossref Scopus (270) PubMed Google Scholar ). Unraveling molecular mechanisms and clinical consequences of NNS consumption on the human host and microbiome may enable to optimize dietary recommendations in preventing and treating hyperglycemia and its metabolic ramifications.
Limitations of our study include the inclusion of healthy, non-overweight, normoglycemic individuals, as NNS effects may differ between healthy and individuals with cardiometabolic diseases ( Nichol et al., 2019 90. Nichol, A.D. ∙ Salame, C. ∙ Rother, K.I. ... Effects of sucralose ingestion versus sucralose taste on metabolic responses to an oral glucose tolerance test in participants with normal weight and obesity: A randomized crossover trial Nutrients. 2019; 12 :29 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ), calling for further studies in these populations. In addition, the NNS in our study were administered as commercially available sachets containing a mixture of glucose and a given NNS. Microbiome and glycemic responses may differ when administered as commercial NNS sachets (containing carbohydrates as fillers) ( Romo-Romo et al., 2018 107.

Nutr. 2019; 122 :856-862 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, Dalenberg et al. elegantly reported an adverse effect of short-term supplementation with sucralose on glycemic control, only when the NNS was coupled with a carbohydrate ( Dalenberg et al., 2020 28. Dalenberg, J.R. ∙ Patel, B.P. ∙ Denis, R. ... Short-term consumption of sucralose with, but not without, carbohydrate impairs neural and metabolic sensitivity to sugar in humans Cell Metab. 2020; 31 :493-502.e7 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ). In line with this observation, we found that a combination of bulking glucose with saccharin or sucralose, but not glucose alone, resulted in an impaired glycemic response, whereas elevated plasma insulin was only observed in individuals supplemented with glucose alone or stevia. Notably, plasma insulin was not measured under fasting conditions, limiting the interpretation of these results. However, if such formulation distinction is true, NNS impacts should be compared in future controlled trials between consumers of carbohydrate-rich and carbohydrate-restrictive diets for their potential differential effects on human metabolic physiology. Of note, longer exposure periods (4–10 weeks) to pure NNS were suggested by some studies to negatively impact metabolic health even in the absence of a carbohydrate additive ( Bueno-Hernández et al., 2020 20.

Ten-week sucralose consumption induces gut dysbiosis and altered glucose and insulin levels in healthy young adults Microorganisms. 2022; 10 :434 Crossref Scopus (1) PubMed Google Scholar ). As such, a longer exposure period than the one utilized in our study may be required to fully assess the potential health ramifications mediated by the altered microbiome upon consumption of different NNS. Likewise, the NNS doses tested in our study were 240 mg (aspartame, ∼8% ADI), 180 mg (saccharin, ∼20% ADI), 102 mg (sucralose, 34% ADI), and 180 mg (stevia, ∼75% ADI). Future studies may determine whether even lower doses may differentially impact the microbiome and host glycemic responses.

This was an open-label, multi-arm RCT that assessed the effects of short-term supplementation of non-caloric sweeteners on the microbiome, glucose tolerance, and additional health parameters, in healthy adults. The primary outcome was blood glucose levels, measured during standardized glucose tolerance tests (GTT) using a continuous glucose monitor (CGM). Secondary outcomes included microbiome readouts in stool and oral samples, and additional anthropometrics. The study protocol and associated procedures were approved by Weizmann Institute of Science Bioethics and Embryonic Stem Cell Research oversight committee (IRB approval number 170-2), and reported to http://clinicaltrials.gov/ , Registration Number NCT03708939. Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects.
Eligible participants were males and females aged 18–70 able to provide informed consent and operate a glucometer and a smartphone. We excluded participants who consumed any quantity of NNS-containing foods or beverages in the six months prior to the trial initiation using an online custom-made food frequency questionnaire, further validated over the phone by a Clinical Research Associate (CRA). Participants were required to provide their consumption frequency (never; once a month; more than once a month; once a week; more than once a week; once a day; more than once a day) for each of the following NNS-containing products on the Israeli market: carbonated diet drinks; sugar-free energy drinks; non-carbonated diet drinks (diet iced tea, diet fruit juices, diet syrups); diet yogurt; sugar-free chewing gum; protein powders/gainers; sugar-free ice-cream; diet/low/sugar-free cookies, cakes, pastry; low/sugar-free jam, marmalade; sachets/tablets/drops of non-nutritive sweeteners; low/sugar-free ketchup or other sauces; sugar-free halva; diet bread / pita bread; diet syrups (chocolate, maple…); sugar-free chocolate; low/sugar-free cereals; any product labeled as “diet / low / sugar-free”. Additional exclusion criteria included: (i) pregnancy or fertility treatments; (ii) breastfeeding (including baby to breast and bottle feeding mother’s expressed breast milk); (iii) usage of antibiotics or antifungals within three months prior to participation; (iv) BMI < 18 or > 28; (v) pre-diagnosed type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus or treatment with anti-diabetic medication; (vi) chronically active inflammatory or neoplastic disease in the three years prior to enrollment; (vii) chronic gastrointestinal disorder, including inflammatory bowel disease and celiac disease; (viii) active neuropsychiatric disorder; (ix) myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident in the six months prior to participation; (x) coagulation disorders; (xi) chronic immunosuppressive medication usage; (xii) alcohol or substance abuse; (xiii) bariatric surgery; (xiv) phenylketonuria excluded randomization to the aspartame group. Screening for individuals meeting the aforementioned criteria was achieved using an online questionnaire, validated over the phone by a CRA or a medical doctor. The most frequent exclusion criterion was NNS consumption ( Figure 1 B).
Between 2018-2020, a total of 131 eligible participants were invited in groups of 4-12 to an initiation meeting at the Weizmann Institute of Science, during which they received full details regarding the study aims, protocol, and risks. After the meeting, all 131 individuals consented to participate, filled an informed consent form, and were randomized to six intervention arms: aspartame, sucralose, saccharin, stevia, glucose vehicle, or no supplement control (see the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) flow diagram in Figure 1 B). Seven participants decided to prematurely terminate their participation for the following reasons ( Figure 1 B): positive result in a pregnancy test conducted during the baseline week (N=1, saccharin); dislike for the taste of the NNS (N=1, sucralose); nausea after performing GTTs (N=1, NSC); pain and minor bleeding during sensor insertion (N=1, stevia); difficulty with adherence to the study protocol (N=3, two in the glucose vehicle group and one in the NSC group). All participants withdrew prior to day 14, thus an intention-to-treat analysis was not feasible. Four additional participants were excluded from the analysis after the trial was completed due to insufficient data for the primary outcome, as follows: mishandling of the CGM resulting in no recorded glucose events (N=1, stevia); less than four valid recorded GTTs (out of nine, see GTT exclusion criteria below, N=3, one each in the stevia, glucose, and NSC groups).
A total of 120 participants were included in the analysis, of which 65% were female, median age 29.95 (IQR 26.93-35.23). No baseline differences were found between the groups in the following parameters ( Table S1 ): Weight, BMI, waist-hip ratio, %HbA1c, CRP, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, ALT, AST (Kruskal-Wallis); dietary habits, smoking (Chi-square).
Germ-free mice were used to causally link between microbiome of NNS-consuming humans and glucose tolerance. All mice were Swiss-Webster WT adult (seven- to nine-week-old) males and served as recipients for fecal microbiome transplants from human donors. All animal studies were approved by the Weizmann Institute of Science Institutional Animal Care and Usage Committee (IACUC), application number 13250419-3.
During an introductory meeting at the Weizmann Institute, consenting individuals were connected to a continuous glucose monitor (CGM; FreeStyle Libre, Abbott) and anthropometric, blood pressure and heart-rate measurements were taken by a Clinical Research Associate (CRA) or a certified nurse, as well as a non-fasting blood test used for the blood works detailed in Table S1 , as well as for insulin and GLP-1 using commercial ELISA kits (Crystal Chem). This was considered as day 0 ( Figure 1 ). Participants arrived for two additional identical sessions on days 14 and 28, which was the last day of the trial. The CGM was replaced on day 14 according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Participants were provided with a kit to sample their microbiome and perform glucose tolerance tests at home on pre-determined days. On days 8-21, participants in all groups except NSC consumed six commercially available sachets of NNS (with glucose as a vehicle bulking agent) or the equivalent amount of glucose daily, dissolved in water. NNS and glucose were provided by the researchers during the introductory meeting. Throughout the 28 days of the trial, participants were instructed to record all daily activities, including standardized and real-life meals, in real-time using their smartphones; meals were recorded with exact components and weights. For oral microbiome profiling, participants serially swabbed their buccal cavity in the morning on pre-determined days during the trial (eight samples per participant), following tooth brushing, but before consumption of food or usage of mouthwash.
Participants were supplied with sachets of commercial formulations of NNS used for sweetening hot beverages, all containing glucose as a bulking agent. Common, commercially available sachets were chosen in order to resemble real-life intake and maximize adherence to the protocol and acceptability of the supplement. The distinct flavor of NNS and glucose rendered blinding unfeasible. Participants consumed six sachets a day during the exposure period, resulting in the following daily doses: aspartame 0.24g & 5.76g glucose, saccharin 0.18g & 5.82g glucose, sucralose 0.102g & 5.898g glucose, stevia (steviol glycosides) 0.18g & 5.82g glucose. These doses are below the acceptable daily intakes, correspondingly: 50mg/kg, 15mg/kg, 5mg/kg, 4mg/kg. The glucose vehicle group was supplemented with 5g of glucose daily. All groups received the same number of sachets per day to allow comparison to the glucose vehicle group. Participants were instructed to consume two sachets of NNS dissolved in water three times during the day: morning, afternoon, and evening. Drinking of NNS was allowed either with or without meals. Participants recorded intake in real-time using a dedicated smartphone app. A CRA reviewed the logs daily to guarantee adherence to the protocol.
Participants were provided with 50 g of glucose (Floris) to perform GTT at home, with the following instructions: (A) at least seven and no more than fourteen hours without any food, supplements, physical activity or any drink other than water prior to GTT initiation; (B) the entire amount of glucose should be dissolved in a cup of water without any supplements and consumed in less than two minutes; (C) no physical activity, food or drinks other than water allowed during two hours after initiation; (D) GTT initiation should be recorded on the smartphone app, and data from the glucose sensor should be downloaded frequently to the reader. Participants received text message reminders on the days of the GTT. Out of 1080 expected GTTs, 5.5% (n=60) were not performed (n=23) or performed but data were not recorded (n=37). Sensor malfunctions resulted in the loss of 1% of GTTs (n=11). In addition, 2.6% of GTTs (n=28) were excluded from the analysis for not meeting the aforementioned requirements, as follows: food consumed during GTT (n=14), physical activity performed during GTT (n=5), fasting exceeds fifteen hours (n=4), consumption of glucose took >10 minutes (n=3), participant took a glucose-lowering medication (n=2). There were no significant differences (Chi-square) in the number of missing/excluded GTTs between phases (P=0.86) or treatment groups (P=0.61).
Daily CoV was evaluated for each participant by dividing the daily standard deviation, considering all glucose measurements of the day, by the daily average. The significance of the trajectory changes in CoV was tested using LMER with participants as random effect and testing for the interaction between time and groups.
Few minor adverse events were reported (n=5), all during the baseline week prior to supplementation with NNS: diarrhea after first GTT (n=2, one in the aspartame group and the other in the NSC group); common cold-like symptoms for several days without need for medical care (n=2, sucralose and saccharin); mild transient pain in the CGM insertion site (n=1, aspartame).
Throughout the trial period, participants logged the following activities on an in-house developed smartphone application ( Zeevi et al., 2015 146. Zeevi, D. ∙ Korem, T. ∙ Zmora, N. ... Personalized nutrition by prediction of glycemic responses Cell. 2015; 163 :1079-1094 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1205) PubMed Google Scholar ): sleep and wakeup time, physical activity (type, duration and intensity), meals, snacks, and drinks (ingredients and quantities), and medications. Participants were monitored at near-real-time for compliance in recording food and activity and contacted by phone as needed. To limit confounding of the dietary analysis by poor or insufficient logging of meals, we included in the final analysis only participants that had at least 20 days with at least 1,000 kcal logged per day; the number of analyzed individuals was not significantly different between the groups.
Germ-free Swiss-Webster WT adult (seven to nine-week-old) male mice served as recipients for fecal microbiome transplants and were housed in sterile isolators (Park Bioservices). Fecal samples from human donors were frozen immediately after collection and were stored in a -80C freezer prior to processing. Two hundred mg of frozen stool was resuspended in 5 ml of sterile PBS under anaerobic conditions (Coy Laboratory Products, 75% N 2 , 20% CO 2 , 5% H 2 ), vortexed for 3 min and allowed to settle by gravity for 2 min. The anaerobic homogenate was transferred to the animal facility in airtight Hungate tubes placed in anaerobic pouches (GasPak™ EZ Anaerobe Pouch System). Transplant into recipient mice was achieved by gavage with 200 μl of the supernatant. Mice were maintained on normal chow diet and water throughout the experiment. Mice were kept in iso-cages with sufficient food and water and were not handled until a glucose tolerance test was performed seven days post-conventionalization. Transplantation efficacy was determined by Bray-Curtis dissimilarity of each recipient mouse to its corresponding human donor, and was comparable between mouse recipients of top and bottom sucralose responder microbiomes and between mouse recipients of baseline and day 21 microbiomes. For glucose tolerance tests , mice were fasted for 6 h during the light phase, with free access to water. Blood from the tail vein was used to measure glucose levels using a glucometer (Bayer) immediately before and 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min after oral gavage feeding with 40 mg glucose (J. T. Baker). In all experiments, each experimental group consisted of at least two cages to minimize cage-effects. To ensure sterility of the mice for this primary readout, additional metabolic outputs that require baseline measurements (e.g., weight) were not recorded.
Illumina libraries were prepared using a Nextera DNA Library Prep kit (Illumina, 20034198) according to the manufacturer’s protocol and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq platform with a read length of 75 bp (single-end) for all samples.
For human microbiome samples, data from the Illumina NextSeq sequencer were converted to fastq files with bcl2fastq, resulting in 1222 stool samples and 735 oral samples (9948552 ± 3440344 average and standard deviation of reads per sample). Sequences were then QC trimmed using Trimmomatic ( Bolger et al., 2014 17. Bolger, A.M. ∙ Lohse, M. ∙ Usadel, B. Trimmomatic: a flexible trimmer for Illumina sequence data Bioinformatics. 2014; 30 :2114-2120 Crossref Scopus (24685) PubMed Google Scholar ) with parameters PE -threads 10 -phred33 ILLUMINACLIP: NexteraPE-PE.fa:2:30:10 SLIDINGWINDOW:4:20 MINLEN:50 and host sequences were removed using KneadData with default parameters using the hg19 reference. We then subsampled all the samples to 1M sequences for stool samples and 250,000 for oral samples, removing all samples below this threshold and retaining 1182 stool and 713 oral samples. We removed 40 additional oral samples due to contamination (defined as abundance of >1% for six or more of the top ten abundant species in stool). Kraken2 ( Wood et al., 2019 140. Wood, D.E. ∙ Lu, J. ∙ Langmead, B. Improved metagenomic analysis with Kraken 2 Genome Biol. 2019; 20 :257 Crossref Scopus (888) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used for taxonomic analysis with a pre-built index database ( Méric et al., 2019 82. Méric, G. ∙ Wick, R.R. ∙ Watts, S.C. ... Correcting index databases improves metagenomic studies bioRxiv. 2019; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ) and Bracken ( Lu et al., 2017 70. Lu, J. ∙ Breitwieser, F.P. ∙ Thielen, P. ... Bracken: estimating species abundance in metagenomics data PeerJ Comput.

The MetaCyc database of metabolic pathways and enzymes Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46 :D633-D639 Crossref Scopus (378) PubMed Google Scholar ) annotations was taken. The in-house pipeline consists of the following steps: first, we use diamond ( Buchfink et al., 2021 19. Buchfink, B. ∙ Reuter, K. ∙ Drost, H.G. Sensitive protein alignments at tree-of-life scale using DIAMOND Nat. Methods. 2021; 18 :366-368 Crossref Scopus (123) PubMed Google Scholar ) against the human gut IGC ( Li et al., 2014 66.

KEGG: kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28 :27-30 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) annotated entries with parameters --max-hsps 1 -k 1 -e 0.0001. We then sum all the hits for each gene divided by its length and grouped to KEGG Orthologs and relative abundance is calculated. Pathways and Modules were computed using EMPANADA ( Manor and Borenstein, 2017 75. Manor, O. ∙ Borenstein, E. Revised computational metagenomic processing uncovers hidden and biologically meaningful functional variation in the human microbiome Microbiome. 2017; 5 :19 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ). For dimensionality reduction of longitudinal microbiome data, participant microbiome trajectories were computed as the fold change from the baseline measurements averages, followed by application of M-product based Tensor Component Analysis (TCAM). Mouse samples were processed in a similar manner, with a total of 91 stool samples, and using the mm10 mouse genome reference. Mice samples were subsampled to 2.5M reads.
Extraction and analysis of lipids and polar/semipolar metabolites was performed as previously described ( Malitsky et al., 2016 74. Malitsky, S. ∙ Ziv, C. ∙ Rosenwasser, S. ... Viral infection of the marine alga Emiliania huxleyi triggers lipidome remodeling and induces the production of highly saturated triacylglycerol New Phytol. 2016; 210 :88-96 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Zheng et al., 2015 147. Zheng, L. ∙ Cardaci, S. ∙ Jerby, L. ... Fumarate induces redox-dependent senescence by modifying glutathione metabolism Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 :6001 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) with some modifications: 90μl of serum were extracted with 1 mL of a pre-cooled (−20˚C) homogenous methanol:methyl-tert-butyl-ether (MTBE) 1:3 (v/v) mixture, containing following internal standards: 0.1 μg ∗ mL -1 of Phosphatidylcholine (17:0/17:0) (Avanti), 0.4 μg ∗ mL -1 of Phosphatidylethanolamine (17:0/17:0, 0.15 nmol ∗ mL -1 of Ceramide/Sphingoid Internal Standard Mixture I (Avanti, LM6002), 0.0267 μg/mL d5-TG Internal Standard Mixture I (Avanti, LM6000) and 0.1 μg ∗ mL -1 Palmitic acid-13C (Sigma, 605573). The tubes were vortexed and then sonicated for 30 min in ice-cold sonication bath (taken for a brief vortex every 10 min). Then, UPLC-grade water: methanol (3:1, v/v) solution (0.5 mL) containing internal following standards: C13 and N15 labeled amino acids standard mix (Sigma) was added to the tubes followed by centrifugation. The upper, organic phase was transferred into 2 mL Eppendorf tube. The polar phase was re-extracted as described above, with 0.5 mL of MTBE. Both organic phases were combined and dried in speedvac and then stored at −80˚C until analysis. For analysis, the lower, polar phase was used for polar and semipolar metabolite analysis was lyophilized and resuspended in 200 μL Methanol:DDW (50:50).
Metabolic profiling of semipolar phase was performed using Waters ACQUITY UPLC system coupled to a Vion IMS QTof mass spectrometer (Waters Corp., MA, USA). The LC separation was as previously described ( Itkin et al., 2011 52. Itkin, M. ∙ Rogachev, I. ∙ Alkan, N. ... Glycoalkaloid METABOLISM1 is required for steroidal alkaloid glycosylation and prevention of phytotoxicity in tomato Plant Cell. 2011; 23 :4507-4525 Crossref Scopus (144) PubMed Google Scholar ) with minor alterations. Briefly, the chromatographic separation was performed on an ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 column (2.1×100 mm, i.d., 1.7 μm) (Waters Corp., MA, USA). The mobile phase A consisted of 95% DDW and 5% acetonitrile, with 0.1% formic acid; mobile phase B consisted of 100% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid. The column was maintained at 35˚C, and the flow rate of the mobile phase was 0.3 mL ∗ min -1 . Mobile phase A was initially run at 100%, and it was gradually reduced to 72% at 22 min, following a decrease to 0% at 36 min. Then, mobile phase B was run at 100% until 38 min; then, mobile phase A was set to 100% at 38.5 min. Finally, the column was equilibrated at 100% mobile phase A until 40 min. MS parameters were as follows: the source and de-solvation temperatures were maintained at 120C and 350C, respectively. The capillary voltage was set to 2 kV at negative ionization mode; cone voltage was set for 40 V. Nitrogen was used as de-solvation gas and cone gas at the flow rate of 700 L ∗ h -1 and 50 L ∗ h -1 . The mass spectrometer was operated in full scan HDMS E negative or positive resolution mode over a mass range of 50–2000 Da. For the high-energy scan function, a collision energy ramp of 20–80 eV was applied; for the low energy scan function – 4 eV was applied. Leucine-enkephalin was used as a lock-mass reference standard.
LC-MS data were analyzed and processed with UNIFI (Version 1.9.4, Waters Corp., MA, USA). The putative identification of the different semipolar species was performed by comparison accurate mass, fragmentation pattern and ion mobility (CCS) values to in-house made semipolar database, when several compounds were identified vs. standards, when available.
Metabolic profiling of polar phase was done as previously described ( Zheng et al., 2015 147. Zheng, L. ∙ Cardaci, S. ∙ Jerby, L. ... Fumarate induces redox-dependent senescence by modifying glutathione metabolism Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 :6001 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) with minor modifications described below. Briefly, analysis was performed using Acquity I class UPLC System combined with mass spectrometer Q Exactive Plus Orbitrap™ (Thermo Fisher Scientific) which was operated in a negative ionization mode. The LC separation was done using the SeQuant Zic-pHilic (150 mm × 2.1 mm) with the SeQuant guard column (20 mm × 2.1 mm) (Merck). The Mobile phase B: acetonitrile and Mobile phase A: 20 mM ammonium carbonate with 0.1% ammonia hydroxide in DDW: acetonitrile (80:20, v/v). The flow rate was kept at 200 μL ∗ min −1 and gradient as follow: 0-2 min 75% of B, 14 min 25% of B, 18 min 25% of B, 19 min 75% of B, for 4 min, 23 min 75% of B. For metabolites normalization, peak areas of metabolites were divided by summed relative abundances of internal standards (labeled amino acids). Further normalization was carried out by dividing each metabolite with the median value of that metabolite, as it was shown to produce the most accurate results ( Wulff and Mitchell, 2018 143. Wulff, J.E. ∙ Mitchell, M.W. A comparison of various normalization methods for LC/MS metabolomics data Adv. Biosci. Biotechnol. 2018; 09 :339-351 Crossref Google Scholar ). Statistical tests were employed using repeated measures one way ANOVA for testing of three time points, and by paired t-test for the two time point analysis (for the sucralose and control groups), FDR-BH correction was applied. For pathway analysis P-value significant metabolites of the sucralose group were run in the MetaboAnalyst pipeline ( Pang et al., 2021 95. Pang, Z. ∙ Chong, J. ∙ Zhou, G. ... MetaboAnalyst 5.0: narrowing the gap between raw spectra and functional insights Nucleic Acids Res. 2021; 49 :W388-W396 Crossref Scopus (523) PubMed Google Scholar ) using the hypergeometric test and the KEGG ( Homo Sapiens ) database.
The data processing was done using TraceFinder (Thermo Fisher Scientific), when detected compounds were identified by accurate mass, retention time, isotope pattern, fragments and verified using in-house-generated mass spectra library.
The sample size for the RCT was calculated to have a power of >80% to detect a 30% increase in glucose tolerance (GTT AUC) with a probability of a type I error (α) of 0.05. This value is based on our preliminary trial, in which we observed an average increase in GTT AUC of 1000 units in saccharin-supplemented individuals ( Suez et al., 2014 117. Suez, J. ∙ Korem, T. ∙ Zeevi, D. ... Artificial sweeteners induce glucose intolerance by altering the gut microbiota Nature. 2014; 514 :181-186 Crossref Scopus (1108) PubMed Google Scholar ). In all linear mixed-effects models, participants were considered as the random effect, reflected as donors in the mouse modeling. In the mouse modelling, we used either responsiveness (top, bottom) or time point (baseline, day 21) as the response variable, while the bacterial feature (gene, pathway, or bacterial species) was used as the explanatory variable. PERMANOVA was used with the stratification of participants when performing the random permutations. For the correlation analysis, we used the average of all mice relating to the same donor and time point to handle repeated samples. Statistical tests were performed in PRISM (V 9.2), R and Python. The tests used in each analysis are indicated in the main text. Types of center and dispersion measures are indicated in the figure legends. PRISM was used as the primary tool for statistical analysis, apart from the microbiome linear mixed modelling (R, lmer package) and microbiome PERMANOVA and univariate testing (Python). The AUC of log fold change was computed only for the topmost informative features detected by TCAM in primary PCs. The computation was performed by taking the cumulative sum of the log 2 fold change from baseline values of each feature, unrelated to the TCAM algorithm computation.
