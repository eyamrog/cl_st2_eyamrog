It is, however, unclear to what extent individual cannabinoids from industrial hemp transfer from the feed into products of animal origin and whether they pose a risk for the consumer. Here we present the results of a feeding experiment with industrial hemp silage in dairy cows. Hemp feeding included changes in feed intake, milk yield, respiratory and heart rates, and behaviour. We combined liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry-based analyses and toxicokinetic computer modelling to estimate the transfer of several cannabinoids (\u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol (\u03949-THC), \u03948-THC, \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid, \u03949-tetrahydrocannabivarin, 11-OH-\u03949-THC, 11-nor-9-carboxy-\u03949-THC, cannabidiol, cannabinol and cannabidivarin) from animal feed to milk. For \u03949-THC, which has a feed-to-milk transfer rate of 0.20%\u2009\u00b1\u20090.03%, the acute reference dose for humans was exceeded in several consumer groups in exposure scenarios for milk and dairy product consumption when using industrial hemp to feed dairy cows.\nA global ban during the first half of the 20th century saw hemp(Cannabis sativa)production relegated to the sidelines of industry and agriculture, despite its potential as a cheap, ecological and versatile crop1. The recent revision of cannabis regulations has triggered a fast-paced growth in the industrial hemp sector which has brought to the market many novel hemp-derived products1,2. This proliferation raises consumer safety issues because hemp contains cannabinoids, a class of substances that interact with the animal and human endocannabinoid system. Some of them\u2014especially \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol (\u03949-THC)\u2014exert a psychoactive effect and others are only pharmacologically active, such as cannabidiol (CBD)3. Cultivation of industrial hemp with a maximum \u03949-THC content of 0.2% is allowed in the European Union4. In 2021, an increase to 0.3% was initiated in the European Union5.\nA transfer of cannabinoids into foods of animal origin is conceivable when by-products of hemp production and the whole plant are used as feedstuffs6. So far, despite a few case reports, experimental data regarding the transfer of \u03949-THC from feed into the milk of cows are scarce and analytical techniques often failed to differentiate between psychoactive \u03949-THC and its non-psychoactive precursor \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (\u03949-THCA)6. Given that \u03949-THCA can be up to nine times more abundant than \u03949-THC in hemp7, this differentiation is crucial to understand transfer processes and subsequently perform risk analysis.\nIn this article, we focus on the effects of industrial hemp silage feeding in lactating dairy cows with the aim of quantifying the transfer of cannabinoids into milk and determining possible effects on animal health and risks for consumer health. We collected and analysed milk, blood plasma and faeces, measured physiological parameters and observed animal behaviour. We employ a liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry-based analytical technique that ensures differentiation between \u03949-THC and \u03949-THCA in various matrices, and enables quantification of the cannabinoids \u03948-tetrahydrocannabinol (\u03948-THC), \u03949-tetrahydrocannabivarin (\u03949-THCV), CBD, cannabinol (CBN), cannabidivarin (CBDV) and the two \u03949-THC metabolites 11-hydroxy-\u03949-THC (11-OH-THC) and 11-nor-9-carboxy-\u03949-THC (THC-COOH). The resulting data were used to develop a predictive toxicokinetic model, which can be used to simulate other exposure scenarios and to assess the transfer of different cannabinoids into cows\u2019 milk when using industrial hemp as a dietary supplement for dairy cows.\nWe conducted a feeding experiment with lactating Holstein Friesian dairy cows, where corn silage in the diet was first partially replaced with hemp silage made from whole plant hemp (very low cannabinoid concentration, hemp silage A) during an adaptation period followed by feeding hemp silage made from leaves, flowers and seeds only (higher cannabinoid concentration, hemp silage E) at two different supplementation levels (group L, low hemp, 0.84\u2009kg dry matter per cow per day; group H, high hemp, 1.68\u2009kg dry matter per cow per day) during an exposure period, and a subsequent hemp-free depuration period (Fig.1a). Partial replacement of corn silage with hemp silage of different nutritional composition also partially changed the total nutritional composition of the diets; however, the major difference was in total cannabinoid concentration (Table1and Supplementary Table1).\na, Study design and sampling strategy.

Means followed by a common letter are not significantly different by a Tukey test.Pvalues (withtvalues and 95% confidence intervals for standardized effect size measures) are from multiple comparisons according to Tukey post hoc tests and are listed in Supplementary Table2and Supplementary Fig.1. To show differences more clearly, standardized effect size measures of animal health parameters were plotted between time periods (pairwise comparisons) with 95% confidence intervals.f, Pictures of cows during exposure period: (1) prolapsed and reddened nictitating membrane; (2) increased salivation with ponding; (3) pronounced tongue play; (4) nasal secretion.\nThe study shows that feeding up to 0.92\u2009kg per cow per day (DM, dry matter) of industrial hemp silage A with very low cannabinoid concentration to dairy cows during the adaptation period had no effect on physiological parameters and health (Fig.1b\u2013e; see Supplementary Table2and Supplementary Fig.1for statistical data).\nIn contrast, feeding of cannabinoid-rich industrial hemp silage E during the exposure period had a significant effect for both group L and group H. A Kruskal\u2013Wallis test showed that feed intake (\u03c72=\u200928.9,P<\u20090.001, d.f.\u2009=\u20095) and consequently milk yield (\u03c72=\u200944.5,P<\u20090.001, d.f.\u2009=\u20095) decreased significantly from the second day of exposure period in both experimental groups (Fig.1b,c). The average ingested doses of \u22069-THC and CBD were 1.6\u2009\u00b1\u20090.3 and 10.7\u2009\u00b1\u20091.9\u2009mg per kg body weight for group L, and 3.1\u2009\u00b1\u20090.7 and 20.4\u2009\u00b1\u20094.4\u2009mg per kg body weight for group H, whereas the dose of the other cannabinoids was \u22641.1\u2009mg per kg body weight (Supplementary Table3). Similarly, the respiratory (\u03c72=\u200950.2,P<\u20090.001, d.f.\u2009=\u20095) and heart rate (\u03c72=\u200977.4,P<\u20090.001, d.f.\u2009=\u20095) decreased significantly within hours in both groups due to the feeding of hemp silage E (Fig.1d,e) and in individual animals fell below physiological reference values, allowing classification as either bradypnea or bradycardia. Concomitantly, changes in animal behaviour and appearance were evident (Fig.1f), such as pronounced tongue play, increased yawning, salivation, nasal secretion formation, prolapse and reddening of the nictitating membrane, and somnolent appearance. Some animals from group H displayed careful, occasionally unsteady gait, unusually long standing and abnormal posture. All changes observed disappeared within two days of discontinuing cannabinoid feeding. Milk constituents (fat, protein, lactose, dry matter, somatic cell count and urea), body temperature and body weight were unaffected in all periods (Supplementary Tables4and5).\nFor humans, the lowest-observed-adverse-effect-level for \u22069-THC is 0.036\u2009mg per kg body weight6. On average, the cows ingested up to 86 times more \u22069-THC during the exposure period, probably explaining the health effects they exhibited. Another study in ruminants reported no health effects, although this involved feeding only 35\u2009g of industrial hemp, a much lower exposure than the present study8. In animals, only a few studies have reported a reduction in feed consumption due to administration of \u22069-THC and CBD, whereas other studies showed no significant decrease or even an increase in feed consumption9,10,11,12,13. Other factors in the silages, such as fermentation acids or lignin (Supplementary Table6), may also have led to the drop in feed intake, but were not observed when feeding industrial hemp silage A during the adaptation period. In contrast, hemp silage E was markedly richer in fat, which could also have led to a reduction in feed intake14. Studies on the suitability of industrial hemp components, other than seeds and oil, as animal feed are rare15, complicating the interpretation of our results. The reduction in daily milk yield is presumably caused by the decrease in feed intake. A decrease in water consumption (not measured) due to cannabinoids in the feed may have promoted the decrease16,17,18. Bradypnea and bradycardia are rare symptoms in cows that only occur in the course of serious illnesses or can be pharmacologically induced. In animal studies, administration of \u22069-THC (but not CBD) influenced respiratory and heart rate and caused drowsiness, slow movements, ataxia and salivation12,13,19,20,21. A reddening of the conjunctiva after \u22069-THC intake is known in humans22,23.\nAlthough it is clear that the observed effects of industrial hemp silage feeding on animal health were mainly caused by the cannabinoids, it cannot be clearly defined which cannabinoid was responsible. Due to its high concentration in the cannabinoid-rich silage, \u22069-THC is the most likely cause, but combination effects may also play a role16,17,24,25. Finally, it should be considered that hemp plants produce other phytochemicals (for example, terpenes, flavonoids) that may have an impact on the changes observed26,27. Similarly, an effect due to minor changes in nutrient concentration of the diets by replacement of corn silage with hemp silage (Supplementary Table1) could not be completely ruled out.\nOur study shows that the feeding of industrial hemp silage to dairy cows, even in small amounts, is associated with health consequences. These seem to be dependent on the cannabinoid concentration of the silage, which is influenced by, among other factors, the variety, the parts of the plant from which the silage is derived and the time of harvest7,28. Due to the manifold parameters influencing the cannabinoid concentration of hemp and derived feed, the innocuousness of hemp cannot be reliably assessed without prior cannabinoid analysis.\nFeeding hemp silage resulted in measurable levels of \u22069-THC, \u22069-THCA, \u22069-THCV, CBD, CBN and CBDV in cow\u2019s milk at the end of the adaptation period and during the exposure period. Concentrations of up to 316\u2009\u00b5g \u22069-THC and 1,174\u2009\u00b5g CBD were detected per kg milk (Fig.2). Maximum values for other cannabinoids in milk were 1.9 (\u22069-THCA), 8.0 (\u22069-THCV), 2.5 (CBN) and 10.1\u2009\u00b5g per kg body weight (CBDV). On the last day of the depuration period, \u22069-THC (group L: 1.4\u2009\u00b1\u20090.4\u2009\u00b5g per kg; group H: 5.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.6\u2009\u00b5g per kg) and CBD (group L: 7.0\u2009\u00b1\u20091.9\u2009\u00b5g per kg; group H: 16.2\u2009\u00b1\u20092.6\u2009\u00b5g per kg) were still detectable in milk. The other cannabinoids analysed were undetectable in milk during all periods (limit of detection (LOD): 0.1 \u00b5g per kg milk for \u22068-THC, 0.5 \u00b5g per kg milk for 11-OH-\u22069-THC and THC-COOH). At the end of the exposure period, the levels in milk were 6\u201326 times higher for \u22069-THC, 3\u20135 times higher for \u22069-THCV and 11\u201332 times higher for CBD than the corresponding blood plasma levels, pointing to the accumulation potential of the substances in cow\u2019s milk. In contrast, \u22069-THCA did not accumulate in milk and CBDV showed no clear trend (Supplementary Table7). Since CBN was undetectable in plasma, no ratio could be calculated. Urine was collected during the experiment, but due to analytical challenges, that is, inconsistent results after glucuronidase treatment, the data could not be evaluated.\nMean\u2009\u00b1\u2009s.d. \u22069-THC and CBD levels. Days 1\u20136 and 8\u201313: no milk samples analysed. *Data interpolated. During the experimental periods, milk samples were taken on days 7, 14\u201324, 26 and 28 from both groups L and H (n=\u20094 per group) for cannabinoid analysis. To compile a sample for analysis, the evening and the following morning milk of each cow were mixed according to their proportion of daily production. The resulting composite samples were stored at \u221220\u2009\u00b0C until HPLC\u2013MS\/MS analysis.\nIn contrast to an earlier study in Holstein calves in which only \u22069-THCA and traces of CBD could be detected in the plasma after hemp feeding8, we were able to detect \u22069-THC, \u22069-THCV, CBD and CBDV, presumably due to the higher dose. Studies on the transfer of cannabinoids from feed into milk are rare and, up to now, only \u22069-THC and THC-COOH have been found in ruminant milk after oral \u22069-THC-exposure29,30. In humans, the transfer of \u22069-THC and CBD into breastmilk after marijuana use has been demonstrated, whereas 11-OH-THC and THC-COOH have not always been found31,32,33. The wide range of reported milk\/plasma ratios for \u22069-THC is consistent with an earlier study31.\nWe set up two-compartment models, as shown in Fig.3a, with either two (model A) or one (model B) excretion outputs from the central compartment. Model A was used for \u03949-THC and CBD, for which enough data were available, and the simplified model B for the other cannabinoids with fewer data. The model reproduces milk data with a Pearson coefficient of determinationr2of 0.92 (Supplementary Fig.2). The model can approximate \u03949-THC and CBD plasma and faeces levels with a Pearsonr2of 0.93 and 0.90, respectively, even though few data points were available. Figure3b,eshows the relative fate of \u03949-THC and CBD, respectively. Only a small fraction ends up in milk, with most of the substance (77% \u03949-THC and 64% CBD) being \u2018eliminated\u2019 in processes such as putative metabolism, biochemical transformations in the gastrointestinal tract and urinary excretion. This hints at a high bioavailability for the compounds, with 20\u201335% being excreted into faeces. Figure3c,d(\u03949-THC) and Fig.3e,f(CBD) show the milk predictive model, obtained using the average of the single model parameters estimates, plotted against the data of all animals in the experiment. The simulation was performed to simulate the same intake scenarios as in the experiment. The predictive models for \u03949-THC and CBD can predict the milk levels in each scenario (L\/H) with an average underestimation between 12% and 26% for the exposure period. Nevertheless the model predictions are in line with the observed data range (Pearsonr2between 0.59 and 0.88), such that they appear sufficient for risk assessment. Model B was successfully used to predict cannabinoid milk levels and to provide an estimate for the transfer rates at steady state. The figures showing the results for \u03949-THCA, \u03949-THCV, CBN and CBDV are included in Supplementary Fig.3.\na, Model structure schema. Model A (used for \u03949-THC and CBD) has three output routes: faeces, elimination and milk. Model B (used for the other cannabinoids) is a simplification of model A, with only two outputs: total elimination and milk.b, Modelled fractions of \u03949-THC output. Most \u03949-THC is eliminated, some is excreted with faeces with only a small amount found in milk.c,d, Predictive model of \u03949-THC excretion in milk for group L (c) and group H (d). The plots show the \u03949-THC amount (mg\u2009d\u22121) excreted in milk against the experimental data of the cows in the group, in a simulation of the experiment with low (c) and high (d) dose.e, Modelled fractions of CBD output. Compared to \u03949-THC, CBD is excreted in higher amounts in the faeces, hinting to lower bioavailability.f,g, Predictive model of CBD excretion in milk for group L (f) and group H (g). The plots show the CBD amount (mg\u2009d\u22121) excreted in milk against the experimental data of the cows in the group, in a simulation of the experiment with low (f) and high (g) dose.\nBoth the data and the models show that cannabinoids display biphasic elimination: there is a rapid decline in milk levels following discontinuation of cannabinoid feeding and further decline over a longer period.\nCannabinoids are metabolized in the liver of mammals, where they undergo biotransformation. Our model lumps these processes into \u2018elimination\u2019 of the central compartment (model A) and total elimination (model B), without details. Having information on these processes would allow for a more refined model and unify the models for individual cannabinoids into a single one including interconversion. Such processes could be quantified using both in vivo and in vitro techniques. Finally, it should be noted that there is still no information on the fate of cannabinoids in the gastrointestinal tract of the cow prior to absorption.\nThe predictive model for each cannabinoid was used to estimate transfer rates at steady state for each substance. The transfer rate is defined as the daily amount of cannabinoids in milk divided by the amount in feed (\u00b5g\u2009\u00b5g\u22121). For \u22069-THC at steady state, we estimate a milk transfer rate of 0.20%, or around 33\u2013100% higher than reported in previous experiments6,29. No data on cow\u2019s milk transfer rates for the other cannabinoids analysed was available from previous literature. We present here the milk transfer rates for \u22069-THCA (0.015%), \u03949-THCV (0.56%), CBD (0.11%), CBN (0.043%) and CBDV (0.0080%) in cows (Supplementary Table8). The transfer rate of \u03949-THCA appears much lower than its decarboxylated counterpart \u03949-THC, which could mean lower bioavailability and\/or that some of the \u03949-THCA does not reach the intestinal tract of the animal, but instead undergoes chemical reactions in the rumen (decarboxylation, bacterial metabolization). The latter putative processes are theoretically possible for each of the studied cannabinoids, as they have similar chemical structures and can potentially interconvert34. Although \u03949-THCV has the highest transfer rate, the low concentrations found in hemp silages make it unlikely to pose a risk to consumers. Overestimation of its transfer rate through putative rumen processes cannot be ruled out. The transfer rate of CBD is in the same range as that of \u03949-THC. Since the CBD concentration in the silage was much higher, as usual for industrial hemp, this resulted in markedly higher milk levels. Thus, CBD may be as relevant as \u03949-THC when assessing consumer risks. CBN and CBDV showed the lowest transfer rates and very low levels in milk, confirming that \u03949-THC and CBD are the main compounds of interest for animal health and consumer safety.\nThe acute reference dose (ARfD) is an estimate of the amount of a substance in food and\/or drinking water that can be ingested in a period of up to 24\u2009h without appreciable health risk to the consumer35. To obtain a rough estimate on the potential risk from exposure to \u22069-THC via milk containing levels as measured in the present study, a cursory toxicological assessment was conducted. The EFSA Rapid Assessment of Contaminant Exposure (RACE) software tool35was used to estimate the exposure to \u22069-THC resulting from consumption of milk and dairy products, considering the measured \u22069-THC levels, and was then compared to the acute reference dose (ARfD) of 1\u2009\u00b5g \u03949-THC per kg body weight derived by EFSA6.\nFor mean and maximum \u22069-THC concentrations in milk from group L, average consumption of milk and dairy products leads to the ARfD being exceeded by up to 14-fold for consumers aged <18\u2009yr, whereas high consumption (95th percentile) exceeds the ARfD up to 57-fold in all population groups. Based on the mean and maximum \u22069-THC levels in milk from group H, the ARfD is exceeded up to 120-fold for all population groups (Table2). Remarkably, even consumption of milk and dairy products from the adaptation period (lowest \u03949-THC in feed) leads to the ARfD being exceeded by 1.5-fold in infant high consumers (95th percentile). Additionally, it should be taken into account that \u03949-THCA present in milk could be converted into \u03949-THC during processing of the milk (for example, ultrahigh-temperature processing)6.\nThus, the exposure scenario based on the data obtained from the transfer study presented herein shows that exposure to \u22069-THC via milk and dairy products could lead to the ARfD being exceeded in some consumer groups.\nWe compared our analytical approach to the Community method for the quantitative determination of \u03949-THC content in hemp varieties, which is laid down in Annex III of Regulation (EU) Number 639\/2014. The approaches differ substantially in extraction method, extraction time, extraction solvent and analytical determination. The Community method uses hexane containing squalane as an internal standard in an ultrasonic bath for extraction, and without further clean-up steps, the analytical separation and determination is performed isothermally by gas chromatography with flame ionization detection (GC-FID). This method has drawbacks: the extraction of \u22069-THC and \u22069-THCA is not complete, and their separate determination is not possible. Additionally, \u22069-THCA may be converted in the GC injector into \u22069-THC. Moreover, coelution of \u03949-THC with other cannabinoids or coextractives of hemp due to the limited clean-up of the crude sample extract and the isothermal GC conditions cannot be excluded. These drawbacks are overcome by our approach. The use of a Soxhlet apparatus enables an almost exhaustive extraction by repeatedly adding freshly dripping solvent, avoiding saturation. In preliminary tests, acetone was found to be more suitable thann-hexane for extraction of \u22069-THC and \u22069-THCA. By using the Community method, the total THC (the sum of \u22069-THC and \u22069-THCA) was 21 and 186\u2009mg per kg DM, respectively for the two industrial hemp silages. In contrast, our new method yielded 65 and 1,317\u2009mg per kg DM, respectively. Analytical determination using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC\u2013MS\/MS) with isotope-labelled internal standards enables the unequivocal separation and identification not only of \u03949-THC and its precursor but also of further cannabinoids at low limits of quantification. Therefore, we question the sensitivity of the Community method when used to determine the actual total THC concentration in hemp.\nOur study shows that feeding cannabinoid-rich industrial hemp silage made from leaves, flowers and seeds leads to a decrease in feed intake and milk yield in dairy cows. Heart rate, respiratory rate and animal behaviour were also negatively affected. Feeding a low-cannabinoid industrial hemp silage made from the whole hemp plant showed no effects on cow health and performance. However, apart from dietary cannabinoids, other factors due to partial replacement of corn silage with industrial hemp silage in this experiment (that is, change in nutrient composition, other secondary plant compounds) could not be completely ruled out. The HPLC\u2013MS\/MS-based analysis method we developed enables a precise determination of the cannabinoid concentration, and differentiates between psychoactive \u03949-THC and non-psychoactive \u03949-THCA. The toxicokinetic modelling has shown that the transfer rates of the examined cannabinoids from feed to milk were less than 1%. Nevertheless, due to the high feed intake, cow\u2019s milk reached substantial levels of \u03949-THC such that the exposure might exceed ARfD in some population groups in our exposure scenario based on the transfer properties presented here. For other cannabinoids, in particular for CBD, which was present in high amounts in industrial hemp (and thus also in cow\u2019s milk after feeding), the data are currently insufficient, thereby preventing an assessment of possible health risks.\nA feeding experiment was conducted with ten lactating Holstein Friesian dairy cows at the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR). The experiment was performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations and was approved by the Regional Office for Health and Social Affairs Berlin (LAGeSo, approval number G 0239\/17). For detailed data on the animals at the beginning of the experiment, see Supplementary Table9.\nThe animals were divided in two groups (L, low hemp; H, high hemp) and housed in cubicles. A partially mixed ration (PMR) was administered in feeding troughs with transponder-controlled scales allowing recording of individual feed intake. The experiment was divided into four periods: control (7\u2009d), adaptation (7\u2009d), exposure (6\u2009d) and depuration (8\u2009d). In the control period, both groups received a hemp-free PMR, containing 7.56\u2009kg corn silage, 1.03\u2009kg wheat straw, 0.87\u2009kg hay, 1.17\u2009kg fodder beet, 3.60\u2009kg rapeseed meal and 0.88\u2009kg of a supplementary feed rich in vitamins and minerals per cow and day (all data in DM). The PMR covered a milk yield of 15\u2009litres per cow per day. In addition, concentrate was provided through transponder-controlled automated feeders based on individual milk yield (0.5\u2009kg per additional litre of milk yield; maximum 5\u2009kg of concentrate per day). Water was offered ad libitum. In the adaptation period, part of the corn silage was gradually replaced with industrial hemp silage A (0.31\u20130.92\u2009kg DM per cow), containing cannabinoids at very low concentrations. In the exposure period, groups L and H had the corn silage replaced proportionately with 0.84 and 1.68\u2009kg DM per cow, respectively, of industrial hemp silage E with higher cannabinoid concentration. Different dosages were chosen to determine dose-dependent effects on the transfer of cannabinoids into milk, cow\u2019s performance and health status. In the depuration period, both groups were again fed with hemp-free diets. Energy content of the PMR was 6.4\u20136.6 MJ net energy for lactation per kg DM, depending on the experimental period. For more information on the composition of the diets, see Supplementary Table1. Throughout the experiment, animal health parameters and performance (feed intake, milk yield, respiratory rate, heart rate and body temperature) were recorded daily, as were behavioural observations. For this the animals were observed for conspicuous behaviour compared to the control period. The focus was on the parameters \u2018muscle tremors\u2019, \u2018hypersalivation\u2019 and \u2018disturbed movement coordination\u2019 described in the literature. Since only an initial recording of possible effects was intended, the observations were not standardized using an ethogram. The respiratory rate of all animals was determined by counting the respiratory movements of the flank region and expressed as breaths per minute. The heart rate was determined by auscultating the chest wall with a stethoscope and expressed as beats per minute. The body temperature was measured rectally. Animal weight was measured weekly using floor scales. Milk samples were collected for each cow twice a day, while blood and faeces were taken only from two cows per group and on few, selected days.\nTwo different industrial hemp varieties were used for the experiment. The industrial hemp variety \u2018Ivory\u2019 was selected as a representative of particularly low \u03949-THC varieties for the adaptation period of the experiment; the industrial hemp variety \u2018Finola\u2019 was selected as a representative of varieties with rather higher \u03949-THC concentration (but still below 0.2% total \u03949-THC) for the exposure period. Both varieties were cultivated at the Leibniz Institute for Agricultural Engineering and Bioeconomy Potsdam (ATB), Germany, in spring 2016. The harvest of the hemp took place at the end of August 2016, at which time the \u2018Ivory\u2019 variety was in the seed formation stage. The \u2018Finola\u2019 variety already bore the first fully mature seeds. The \u2018Ivory\u2019 variety was cut with a harvester (JF FC 800) and the entire plant was chopped to produce whole plant silage (silage A). For the production of a leaf-flower-seed silage (silage E), only leaves, flowers and seeds of the \u2018Finola\u2019 variety were harvested. For this purpose, a home-made harvester, constructed by the ATB, was used, which removed the desired plant parts from the stem by means of whips. Immediately after harvest, the hemp was moved into round 510 litre rain barrels, compacted in layers by body weight (tamping) and then sealed airtight. A water-filled hose in the barrel lid allowed gas to escape from the ensiled material without allowing ambient air to flow in. No silage additives were added. In October 2017, the industrial hemp silages were opened, aliquoted in 120 litre bags and stored at \u221220\u2009\u00b0C for the experiment. The cannabinoid concentration of the industrial hemp silages can be found in Table1.\nMilk samples for cannabinoid analysis were taken at days 7, 14\u201324, 26 and 28. The cows were milked in a double tandem milking parlour until the milk flow stopped and the milk was collected in milking pails. Before sampling, milk was stirred to achieve an even distribution of the lipophilic cannabinoids. The resulting milk samples were refrigerated (8\u2009\u00b0C) for a maximum of 18\u2009h until mixing. After reheating (37\u2009\u00b0C, water bath), samples of evening and the following morning milk of each cow were mixed according to their proportion of daily production. The resulting composite samples were stored in lightproof high-density polyethylene bottles and were frozen at \u221220\u2009\u00b0C until analysis. Milk samples for the determination of milk constituents were taken at the end of each period and were refrigerated at 8\u2009\u00b0C until analysis.\nBlood plasma and faeces were collected from two animals per group at days 7, 14, 20 and 22. Blood was obtained by puncturing the jugular vein and collected in coagulant tubes with potassium oxalate monohydrate. After cooling for 30\u2009min, blood samples were centrifuged at 1,876gfor 15\u2009min and the plasma extracted and stored for analysis. Blood plasma was used instead of whole blood because of ease of handling and because plasma has been shown to contain a large proportion of blood cannabinoids36,37,38. Faeces was collected during spontaneous defecation, when possible. Otherwise, faeces was collected from the rectum. Plasma and faeces samples for the determination of cannabinoids were stored in lightproof high-density polyethylene bottles and were frozen at \u221220\u2009\u00b0C until analysis. Samples of the hemp silage were taken prior to the experiment and were stored in freezer bags at \u221220\u2009\u00b0C until analysis.\nThe cannabinoid analysis was performed at the Chemical and Veterinary Analytical Institute M\u00fcnsterland-Emscher-Lippe (CVUA-MEL), according to an approach described in ref.39. The method comprises the following native cannabinoids: \u03949-THC, \u03949-THCA, \u03948-THC, \u03949-THCV, CBD, CBN, CBDV, and the two \u03949-THC-metabolites 11-OH-THC and THC-COOH. For calculation of the recoveries and quantification, the following deuterated internal standards were used: \u03949-THC-D3, CBD-D3, CBN-D3, 11-OH-\u03949-THC-D3, 11-nor-9-carboxy-\u03949-THC-D3and 11-nor-9-carboxy-\u03949-THC-D9. Except for \u03949-THCA, which was purchased from Fluka, all other compounds were acquired from Cerilliant.\nAt the beginning of the analysis, the samples were fortified with a mixture of deuterated internal standards. A further deuterated standard was added at the end of the clean-up prior to the analytical determination. The extraction and the subsequent clean-up steps were adapted to the various matrices and differ to some extent. The final analytical separation, identification and quantification by HPLC\u2013MS\/MS were the same for all matrices.\nThe extraction of cannabinoids from milk was performed with acetone in a polypropylene tube by shaking on an orbital shaker. Precipitated proteins and sugars were removed after centrifugation. A subsequent liquid\/liquid extraction with hexane in the presence of a saturated NaCl solution followed. After phase separation, the organic phase was subsequently evaporated to dryness under a gentle stream of nitrogen. Following reconstitution with cyclohexane\/ethyl acetate (1\u2009+\u20091), application of gel permeation chromatography (GPC) on Bio-Beads S-X3 served as the final clean-up step. After GPC clean-up, ethylenglycol was added to the extract which after careful evaporation was reconstituted in acetonitrile\/water (50\/50) for HPLC\u2013MS\/MS analysis.\nPlasma samples were subjected to an enzymatic cleavage with \u03b2-glucuronidase in phosphate buffer for 3\u2009h at 50\u2009\u00b0C. After cooling down, acetic acid and acetone were added to the solution for the extraction of the cannabinoids, which was performed by shaking on an orbital shaker. Plasma samples without cleavage were extracted with acetic acid and acetone by shaking on an orbital shaker. After centrifugation and removal of precipitated coextractives, a liquid\/liquid extraction with hexane in the presence of a saturated Na2SO4solution was performed. Ethylenglycol was added to the organic phase, which was carefully evaporated to dryness and subsequently reconstituted in acetonitrile\/water (50\/50) for HPLC\u2013MS\/MS analysis. Due to unexplained losses of \u03949-THC and other cannabinoids during \u03b2-glucuronidase treatment, we decided to use the analysis values without enzymatic cleavage for evaluation and modelling.\nFeed and faeces samples were mixed with Na2SO4, transferred into an extraction thimble and extracted with acetone for 6\u20138\u2009h in a Soxhlet apparatus. The extract was reduced and, depending on the concentrations of the cannabinoids, an aliquot of the concentrated extract was evaporated under a gentle stream of nitrogen to dryness. After reconstitution in cyclohexane\/ethyl acetate (1\u2009+\u20091), the extract was further purified on GPC as described for milk.\nHPLC\u2013MS\/MS analysis was performed on an Agilent 6460A triple-quadrupole system equipped with an electrospray source operated in positive ionization mode. For separation of the analytes, a ZorBAX SB-C18 column (2.1\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2009mm, 1.8\u2009\u00b5m) at a column temperature of 30\u2009\u00b0C was used. A flow rate of 0.2\u2009ml\u2009min\u22121and a gradient comprising of acetonitrile\/0.1% formic acid (eluent A) and water\/0.1% formic acid (eluent B) were applied.\nFor each cannabinoid and metabolite the collision energies in MS\/MS mode were optimized to gain at least two intensive transitions. While the first transition was used for quantification based on a seven-point calibration curve, the second transition served as a qualifier; that is, the ratio of the two transitions had to comply with the corresponding reference standard as a second criterion besides the complying retention time for unequivocal identification of the respective analyte.\nDepending on the cannabinoid and metabolite, the limits of detection (LOD) were determined as 0.01-0.4\u2009ng\u2009ml\u22121for milk, 0.1\u20130.5\u2009ng\u2009ml\u22121for plasma and 0.2\u20132.0\u2009ng per g DM for feed and faeces. The corresponding limits of quantification (LOQ) were a factor of three higher.\nThe validation of the accredited method was performed by spiking experiments of cannabinoid-free matrices at a high and a low level, respectively, which generally revealed recoveries of >85% and coefficients of variation of <15%.\nThe fat, protein, lactose and DM content of milk were analysed using accredited methods. Urea was measured using a Reflotron; somatic cell count was performed using a DeLaval DCC. All analyses were conducted at the BfR. The daily values of each parameter were calculated from the received values of the evening and the following morning milk samples.\nOne animal from group L was excluded from the experiment at the beginning of the adaptation period due to a disease not related to the experiment (lameness). One animal from group H completed the experiment and was subsequently excluded from the statistical calculations due to a metabolic disease (subclinical ketosis) developed during the experiment. The statistical evaluation was conducted with the data from the remaining eight animals. Since our data did not follow a normal distribution, non-parametric tests were used.\nAnimal health parameters and performance\u2014feed intake, milk yield, respiratory rate, heart rate, body temperature, body weight and milk constituents\u2014were compared between six groups (1, groups L\u2009+\u2009H: control; 2, groups L\u2009+\u2009H: adaptation; 3, group L: exposure; 4, group H: exposure; 5, group L: depuration; 6, group H: depuration) applying the non-parametric Kruskal\u2013Wallis test with the function kruskal.test() from the stats package. Post hoc analyses were performed with the non-parametric Tukey test (pairwise comparisons) with the glht function from the R package multcomp40to find the groups that differ significantly after global the Kruskal\u2013Wallis test rejected the null hypothesis.\nTo show the distribution of animal health parameters and performance in groups and periods, a violin plot combines the kernel density curve with an error bar41. The error shows the mean and the standard deviation. Different letters on plots indicate statistical significance in pairwise comparisons performed with Tukey post hoc tests. Letters shared in common between six groups (15 pairwise tests) indicate no significant difference. Statistical evaluations and graphs were performed with the statistical software R v.4.0.242. All statistical tests were two-sided.\nAs experimental data were available in concentrations and we opted for modelling cannabinoid amounts, we calculated cannabinoid amounts from the experimental data. To do so, we used both experimental data (that is, daily milk yield, body weight) and equations from veterinary literature to infer the missing information. To obtain the daily cannabinoid amount in milkAmilk,daily, the daily milk yield is multiplied with the cannabinoid concentration on each day. We assume each cow to have 65\u2009ml blood per kg body weight (physiological range, 55\u201375\u2009ml per kg body weight43) and a haematocrit of 33.8% (physiological range, 19.5\u201342.5%44), so that each cow has 43\u2009ml plasma per kg body weight. The daily dry faecal outputMfaeces,dailywas estimated using the mass balance, where\nwith digestible dry matterdDM=\u200979.36\u2009\u2013\u20092.85NL, where NL is the nutrition level of the cow, calculated from the cow\u2019s daily feed uptake45. For concentration values under the LOD or LOQ, we set them to the respective LOD\/LOQ value (upper bound estimation). For intake data at timet,I(t), we multiplied the feed intake amount with the cannabinoid concentration. Since there were problems with the urine analysis, we could not use the urinary concentration data.\nAfter analysing different options, we opted for a two-compartment model (Fig.3a), which provides an accurate mathematical representation of the observed data, compatible with the limitations of the available dataset. We used two different versions of it, model A for \u03949-THC and CBD for which some plasma concentration data are available, and model B for the remaining cannabinoids (\u03949-THCA, \u03949-THCV, CBN and CBDV), for which plasma levels were not consistently detectable.\nModel A has two compartments, GI (gastrointestinal) tract and plasma. The GI tract compartment takes the daily amount of cannabinoid ingested by the cow as inputI(t), transfers the absorbed cannabinoid amount into the plasma and outputs the amount of cannabinoid excreted with faeces out of the system. The parameters regulating this process areFa(fraction absorbed) andkp, the latter regulating the rate of passage out of the GI tract, which contains anAGItractamount of cannabinoids. We fixedkpat 1.3\u2009d\u22121, a value tantamount to a GI tract passage rate of 5%\u2009h\u22121, in accordance with animal physiology literature46. The plasma compartment, which takes its input from the GI tract, outputs either to milk (Amilk, mainly controlled by parameterkm) or to elimination (through parameterke). The latter is mainly controlling the total amount of cannabinoids eliminatedAelim(lumping putative urinary excretion, metabolization and other possible physiological processes). The mathematical representation of the model is a system of ordinary differential equations that assumes zero- or first-order kinetics for all of the modelled processes, so that\nThe amount of cannabinoid transferred into milk is then given by\nFor the complete equation set, see the description of model A in theSupplementary Information.\nModel B is a simplification of model A, where the plasma becomes a central compartment with only one output to milk. In this case, the absorption parameter becomesFb, that is, the absorbed fraction bioavailable for milk excretion. The GI tract output becomes the total elimination, accounting not only for faecal excretion but also for putative physiological elimination processes such as urinary excretion, metabolization and other possible processes. The ordinary differential equation system in this case becomes\nThe amount of cannabinoid transferred into milk is\nThe complete equation set can be found in the description of model B in theSupplementary Information.\nThe models were implemented using Python3 and then fitted with the lmfit module to the data to obtain parameters for the predictive model. The lmfit module (https:\/\/lmfit.github.io\/lmfit-py\/) provides a solid interface to perform nonlinear least-squares minimization. The code is available in theSupplementary Information, as is an executable Python file with the predictive model (PredictiveModel.zip). We used the Levenberg\u2013Marquardt algorithm to solve the minimization problem, with the distance function being the squared difference between the dataset points (amount of cannabinoid excreted with milk\/faeces or present in milk on a given day) and the corresponding modelled amount. For each cannabinoid, we fitted one model to each cow dataset, obtaining a range of parameter estimates (Supplementary Fig.2). Cow H5 model was not included in the final average parameters estimation because of the subclinical ketosis it developed during the experiment. As the available data (non-milk data were available only for two cows in each group) were not sufficient for the solver to find a minimum for the objective function (squared sum of residuals), we placed a boundary on the parameter space. To obtain the final parameter estimation, we used the following procedure:\nModel A:\nFixkp= 1.3\u2009d\u22121.\nFit model to each single cow dataset (initial estimate:Fa=\u20090.8,km=\u200910,ke=\u20093,000).\nCalculate\\(\\overline {F_{\\mathrm{a}}}\\)using onlyFafrom models fitted to dataset with non-milk data.\nSet\\(F_{\\mathrm{a}} = \\overline {F_{\\mathrm{a}}}\\)for next fit initial estimate.\nSetFanot to vary in fit for cows without non-milk data.\nFit each single cow dataset to model A with updated initial estimate.\nCalculate\\(\\overline {k_{\\mathrm{e}}}\\)(geometric mean).\nSet upper bound for\\(k_{\\mathrm{e}} = \\overline {k_{\\mathrm{e}}}\\).\nFit model to each single cow dataset with updated constraints\nTake the average of each parameter (using the geometric mean where appropriate), excluding cow H5 (subclinical ketosis), as the final model parameters.\nModel B:\nFixkp=\u20091.3\u2009d\u22121.\nFixkm=\u20091\u2009d\u22121.\nFit each single cow dataset milk data to model B to obtainFb(initial estimate:Fb=\u20090.01).\nFinal model parameter is\\(F_{\\mathrm{b}} = \\overline {F_{\\mathrm{b}}}\\)(arithmetic average excluding cow H5, subclinical ketosis)\nThe optimized model parameters were used to create a predictive cannabinoid milk transfer model for each of the selected cannabinoids. Two Python files, containing an implementation of the model, are included in theSupplementary Software(PredictiveModel.zip). To run the model, open the exec.py file in a Python3 console, select a cannabinoid by assigning to the CANNABINOID variable the correct string, set the DOSE, EXPOSURE_DURATION and DEPURATION values and run the code. It will return a plot with the selected cannabinoid amount in milk over the selected exposure scenario.\nTo evaluate the concentration of \u22069-THC we measured in cow milk, the EFSA RACE software tool was used. The RACE tool estimates acute and chronic exposure from single foods using food consumption information from the EFSA Comprehensive European Food Consumption Database (Comprehensive Database), comparing it to relevant toxicological reference points. The Comprehensive Database summarizes existing national information on food consumption at the individual level and is the most complete and detailed collection of food consumption data currently available for the European Union. Among other things, the output of the tool is the percentage exhaustion of the toxicological reference value for various population groups35. For the assessment, the mean and maximum \u22069-THC concentrations in milk during the adaptation and exposure period were used. Analogous to previous exposure estimates6, it was assumed that this concentration would be found in milk and milk products made from it. Due to the delayed build-up of \u22069-THC in milk, the values of the last day of the adaptation period and the second to sixth day of the exposure period were used to calculate the means. The ARfD of 1\u2009\u00b5g per kg body weight derived by the EFSA6was applied as the toxicological reference value.\nFurther information on research design is available in theNature Portfolio Reporting Summarylinked to this article.\nThe datasets generated during the experiment are available from the corresponding authors on reasonable request.\nThe complete code for modelling is available from the corresponding authors on reasonable request.\nCrini, G., Lichtfouse, E., Chanet, G. & Morin-Crini, N.

Here we conducted a systematic scoping review that accounts for multiple dimensions of sustainability to describe the extent, range and nature of peer-reviewed literature that assesses the sustainability performance of four FSTs: plant-based alternatives, vertical farming, food deliveries and blockchain technology. Included literature had a dominant focus on environmental sustainability and less on public health and socio-economic sustainability. Gaps in the literature include empirical assessments on the sustainability of blockchain technology, plant-based seafood alternatives, public health consequences of food deliveries and socio-economic consequences of vertical farming. The development of a holistic sustainability assessment framework that demonstrates the impact of deploying FSTs is needed to guide investments in and the development of sustainable food innovation.\nTechnologies in the food sector, such as cellular agriculture, are being developed at a considerable pace to facilitate the transformation towards achieving food system sustainability1. We here define them as food system technologies (FSTs) that have been recently introduced at various parts of the food supply chains to address current systemic challenges that prevent sustainable food systems. Data on investment trends show that their development has been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic and has generated strong interest from venture capital firms2. These FSTs are often surrounded by a sustainability halo, a socio-psychological phenomenon of perceiving a product as sustainable based on positive attributes, leading to a higher willingness to pay (WTP). This has created an innovation space that often strives to reduce climate impact from the food sector but disregards other dimensions of sustainability. As outlined in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the comprehensive concept of sustainability addresses multiple environmental, economic and social impact factors3, with synergies and trade-offs within and across them4. Innovations in the food industry can impact all these sustainability pillars, potentially leading to unintended consequences5. Yet, while many well-defined tools exist to study the food system as a whole6,7,8, there is no such defined toolset and inventory of sustainability indicators to empirically assess the sustainability performance of FSTs.\nConsidering the three pillars of sustainability, this multidisciplinary scoping review examines the extent, range and nature of the peer-reviewed literature that assessed the sustainability performance of FSTs and summarizes the research findings. To accomplish this, we first identify sustainability indicators that have been used in the literature to assess FSTs and then synthesize empirical evidence indicating FSTs sustainability performance compared with the technologies they intend to replace. Finally, we identify implications for research and practice in relation to the development of comprehensive sustainability assessments.\nWe focus on four divergent but representative FSTs that aim to address sustainability-related issues at different parts of the food supply chain: plant-based alternatives (PBAs), vertical farming (VF), food deliveries (FD) and blockchain technology (BT) (Fig.1). We selected these FSTs by mapping investment flows into food start-ups in the Nordic region and selected the four FSTs that received the most investments in the first half of 2021 (Supplementary Material Section2).\nOverview of the FSTs included in this review that are driving food system transformation at different entry points of the food supply chain. Credit: This figure has been designed using icons provided by Flaticon.com.\nWe retrieved 1,493 studies from the initial search, of which 79 articles met our inclusion criteria and have been included in the analysis (Fig.2).\nIndicating the selection process of eligible studies.\nThe majority of the included papers assessed PBAs (n=\u200937), dominated by meat alternatives (PBMA) and dairy alternatives, while only two studies assessed seafood or egg alternatives. This was followed by literature that assessed VF (n=\u200916), BT (n=\u200914) and FD (n=\u200911).\nThe heat map cross-references all the included studies on PBAs, VF and FD to show the frequency of studies that investigated sustainability indicators. Impact domains are split by social, environmental and economic sustainability, from the left. Source data are provided in theSupplementary Data. HTP, human toxicity potential; WTB, willingness to buy; WTP, willingness to pay.\nThe retrieved literature represents a wide geographical scope, with case studies spanning 40 countries across six continents. Regional representation varied across the different FSTs, visualized in Supplementary Material Section5. Case studies on VF had a dominant focus on Europe (63%), FD on Asia (60%) and PBAs on Europe (55%) and northern America (19%). Literature on BT mainly elaborated a global perspective, with some case studies focusing on different countries, primarily from Asia (56%).\nThe sustainability of these FSTs has been addressed using a range of study designs assessing different indicators. The majority of the literature employed life cycle assessment (LCA) to study the environmental impact (n=\u200926), cross-sectional and intervention studies for consumer behaviour (n=\u200911), nutritional analysis to determine the nutritional content of foods (n=\u200910) and modelling studies for economic indicators (n=\u20097). We captured systematic and non-systematic reviews (n=\u200913), mostly focusing on BT (n=\u20098). Other methods that have been applied to case studies (n=\u200912) are detailed in theSupplementary Data.\nFor PBAs, VF and FD we observed a wide range of indicators empirically assessing all three dimensions of sustainability, with clear differences across FSTs (Fig.3). The results for BT are presented separately (Fig.4) and are not analysed further as the contribution of BT to sustainability was described using different indicators and was not empirically investigated.\nExtracted from retrieved literature and positioned in relation to the biosphere-based foundation of sustainability science adapted from ref.69.\nThe performance of PBAs is split by different pillars of sustainability due to the range and extent on identified literature. The performance of VF is presented as a whole. Stratified results according to different system boundary and functional unit settings are presented in Supplementary Material Section6. This assessment could not be carried out for BT and FD as we identified insufficient literature comparing them with the baseline scenario they intend to replace.\nStudies investigating PBAs comprehensively assessed a wide range of environmental impact factors, dominated by greenhouse gas emissions (GHGe) (n=\u200916), land use (LU) (n=\u200911) and water use (WU) (n=\u200912). Evidence on the release of excess nutrients were also frequently provided, assessing the eutrophication (n=\u200912), acidification (n=\u20098) and ecotoxicity potential (n=\u200910). Three studies assessed the carbon opportunity cost of agricultural land, taking into account the amount of CO2that could be sequestered by replacing conventional meat with PBMA9,10,11. As metrics for social sustainability, studies assessed primarily nutritional adequacy (n=\u200914). Consumer acceptance (n=\u200911), willingness to buy and pay (n=\u20098), energy use (n=\u20097) and product price (n=\u20092) were assessed as economic indicators.\nStudies that focused on the environmental impact of VF most frequently assessed GHGe (n=\u20099) and WU (n=\u20096). To indicate their economic sustainability energy use (n=\u20097), yield production efficiency (n=\u20094), financial profit (n=\u20093) and consumer acceptance have been assessed (n=\u20092).\nThe literature on FD focused primarily on assessing GHGe (n=\u200910) and plastic waste (n=\u20097) as environmental impact factors and energy use as an economic indicator (n=\u20093). As social indicators, human health consequences have been assessed. These encompass non-communicable diseases deriving from food plastic packaging12and increasing consumption of unhealthy products13.\nApplying BT to the food sector was described, but not analytical assessed, as enabling primarily social but also environmental and economic sustainability. As indicators and methods to describe the sustainability of BT deviated from the other FSTs, they are presented in a separate format (Fig.4). Through its main function, food traceability, it can contribute to food safety by reducing the consumption of contaminated food worldwide, thereby reducing food waste and improving economic efficiency14,15,16,17,18,19,20. The potential of BT to decrease food waste has been emphasized in case studies from the dairy industry16and the supply chains of pork products and mangoes19. Findings from case studies on the halal food industry15and the tilapia fish industry in Ghana21indicate that BT can increase food quality, safety and integrity. It can further foster collaboration among food supply chain actors, thereby increasing process and cost efficiencies, trust and profitability17. Regarding environmental sustainability, BT can be applied to monitor environmental impacts and support farmers to reduce the use of chemical inputs, water and soil. Traceability-enabled food labelling can then indirectly improve environmental sustainability through consumers demanding veracity of sustainable food production and processing17. Three studies emphasized the potential of BT to reduce overfishing18,22,23in line with SDG 14.6 to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing17. In general, applying BT to the fish industry has been described as beneficial to a range of SDGs22. Included literature also elaborated on limitations that deploying blockchain could entail (Fig.4).\nBelow we outline how the various FSTs performed in relation to the three sustainability pillars and indicators compared with the baseline technology they are intended to replace, focusing exclusively on the studies that conducted this comparison (PBA\u2009=\u200927, VF\u2009=\u200910, FD\u2009=\u20093). BT is not included in this section as its sustainability performance was not empirically investigated (detailed in Methods).\nWe observed high-level agreement across the literature that PBAs tend to have a lower environmental impact than conventional animal-based products (Fig.5). In general, they are associated with less CO2equivalent, less WU9,24,25,26and less LU9,24,25,26,27and have a lower ecotoxicity9,10,25,28,29,30, acidification9,10,25,28,30,31and eutrophication potential10,25,26,27,28,29,30,31, with some exceptions. For instance, one LCA study found that almond milk is more water-intense than dairy milk and has a higher environmental footprint in general when assessed on a cradle to consumer system boundary assumption28. Two studies found that the production of plant-based dairy alternatives has a higher energy demand than conventional dairy28,31.\nIn contrast, no such clear agreement was observable for nutritional performance. We found PBAs generally contained lower levels of proteins, with discernible differences depending on the commodity they are based on. For instance, one study30found that burger patties made out of mycoprotein contained higher protein, those made from peas similar and those on a soy basis lower levels of protein content than beef patties30. Sodium content was found higher in cheese alternatives based on coconut oil than on cashew nuts or soy32. PBAs had generally lower contents of saturated fat, except coconut-oil-based cheese products32and two legume-based burger patties26. The total nutritional performance of PBAs, assessed with nutrient profiling models, was mostly higher10,30,33, or no difference was discernible30,34. PBAs received lower consumer acceptance30,35,36and were higher in cost than conventional animal-based products37,38.\nWe found consensus that growing vegetables by VF outperforms cultivation on-field and in greenhouses in terms of LU39,40,41,42and WU40,41,43,44. One study modelled that lettuce production in VF in the Netherlands could require 95% less water compared with current production in greenhouses due to its water-recycling potential44. We identified agreement that VF is responsible for higher GHGe than open-field cultivation39,40but lower than greenhouses39,40,44,45. By contrast, VF has been assessed less efficient in terms of energy inputs than on-field cultivation40and greenhouses40,43,44. The degree of environmental impact has been found to depend to a large extent on the growing substrate, packaging material and the source of energy46. Regarding economic indicators, we found agreement that VF has a higher yield production than greenhouses43, leading to slightly higher economic revenues43,47.\nGrocery delivery performed better in terms of GHGe and energy use compared with individual retail trips when assuming they are made by car but not on foot, by bike or public transport48. Meal delivery had a lower performance than preparing the meal at home or consuming it at the restaurant49,50, mainly attributed to plastic food packaging waste generated by delivered meals51. Research demonstrates that walking to the restaurant and consuming the meal there instead of having it delivered could reduce the total amount of GHGe by 68% per meal50.\nWe synthesized empirical evidence indicating the sustainability performance of four FSTs. We did not identify empirical evidence for BT and revealed considerably more evidence on the sustainability performance of PBAs than for VF and FD. Environmental indicators were assessed more frequently than social and economic indicators, adding on the concern to ensure that socio-economic sustainability receives more attention5,52,53.\nOur analysis on the sustainability performance of PBAs revealed that their environmental impacts are generally lower than those of their animal-based counterparts, while no such clear trend was observable for social and economic consequences. Public health consequences of PBAs have been exclusively addressed by comparing their nutritional profiles against conventional products, with no focus on other indicators such as food safety or epidemiological implications. Included studies found that PBAs are often higher in sodium than their animal-based counterparts, one of the leading dietary risk factors for global mortality and morbidity54. There is a distinct lack of studies assessing the social and economic implications of shifting towards PBAs. Included studies revealed that PBAs are currently higher in costs than conventional animal products, which could generate the impression that a plant-based diet is more expensive and seen as a luxury, leading to social inequalities. We synthesized research showing that consumer acceptance and WTP for PBAs is currently lower than for conventional meat but could increase to the same level after information concerning health or environmental consequences is provided55.\nThe vast majority of included PBA studies assessed meat and dairy analogues. Despite the fact that the market of seafood analogues is predicted to grow rapidly56, only two studies investigated the sustainability of seafood analogues27,33. This is most likely because seafood analogues have only recently been introduced, especially outside Asia. We can assume that LCA studies on seafood analogues would present similar results to PBMA, as both are derived mainly from terrestrial plant sources such as soy and sunflower oil. However, blue foods have been associated with lower GHGe than terrestrial meat57. Future studies should therefore compare seafood analogues with conventional fish, including impact factors specific to aquatic systems such as wild stock depletion. Further, while the consumption of conventional meat products is linked to human health hazards, consuming seafood is associated with nutritional benefits58. While seafood analogues could help to meet the growing seafood demand and reduce overfishing, it is necessary to investigate the socio-economic and public health implications of these products.\nVF has been described as a resource-saving production system, improving food safety and quality while providing economic benefits59. However, we found a distinct lack of evidence modelling the socio-economic implications of scaling it which have been largely theoretically outlined in a recent review60. Further, the local food production enabled by VF is often considered as environmentally sustainable, partly due to the general assumption of high CO2equivalent emissions resulting from transport. Conversely, we gathered evidence that VF is responsible for higher GHGe and are more energy-intense than open-field cultivation. However, a widespread transition to renewable energy and resource-saving materials, such as paper pots and coir as growing substrate, could lead to large environmental impact reductions46. Further, the sustainability performance and benefit of VF depends to a large extent on the regional context, being primarily recommendable for climate-extreme areas44,61.\nFD services, especially on-time groceries, are growing rapidly and are backed by billion-dollar investments. The retrieved literature focused primarily on assessing GHGe and energy use. Beyond that, we found that their implications on environmental and social sustainability have not yet been empirically assessed. The World Health Organization also expressed concern about the still insufficiently studied public health consequences of the growing delivery sector and has called for more evidence62.\nSystematic reviews and descriptive case studies revealed the potential of BT to enable a sustainable food supply chain, but there is a distinct lack of empirical case studies validating these assumptions. Further studies that estimate correlation or causal inferences between applying BT and sustainability benefits are needed. Aside from the opportunity to strengthen the ecological dimension of sustainability through blockchain adoption, the majority of the literature addressed the potential of BT to improve social and economic rather than environmental sustainability.\nOur review demonstrates that the sustainability performance of FSTs is influenced by methodological specifications, such as defining the functional unit and system boundary in LCA studies. For instance, Grant et al. calculated that almond and soy milk have a lower environmental footprint than dairy milk when assessed from cradle to gate but a higher footprint when assessed from cradle to consumer as it also factors in transport emissions28. We conducted a cross-spatial analysis of the study results, which necessitates cautious generalizations. Each study is unique from a geographical, temporal and methodological perspective. For example, results revealed that VF generally requires more electricity than their baseline scenario63, but the extent strongly depends on the region and type of purchased energy. A comparative analysis found that the relative efficiency of VF compared with greenhouses in mainland Europe is low, while it is much higher in low-light spatial conditions such as northern Sweden or water-scarce regions such as Abu Dhabi44. Similarly, cultural differences can lead to geographically different social sustainability performances of innovations. For instance, consumer acceptance of PBMA and cellular meat was assessed higher in China than in the United States64.\nWe therefore echo the concern expressed in previous studies that methodological inconsistencies among environmental assessment studies complicate generalizing results65. To investigate how the methodological assumptions in the included studies affect the sustainability performance of FSTs, we conducted the analysis separately for different functional unit and system boundary settings (Supplementary Material Section6).\nThe breadth and interdisciplinarity of this review posed challenges on the inclusion and analysis of heterogenetic data. We focused on synthesizing peer-reviewed articles, which excluded conference proceedings, reports and book chapters. Given the growing interest in FSTs, we assume that a range of grey literature exists that future systematic reviews should include. We yielded a wide geographic scope of publications, but our searches were limited to English-language literature.\nWe compared the sustainability performance of FSTs against the baseline scenario they intend to replace but not among and in between them. This generalizing approach does not necessarily allow conclusions to be drawn on individual products as the performance depends on a range of factors, such as the raw material they are based on. For example, cheese analogues based on soy were found to have a better nutritional performance than those based on coconut oil32.\nThe chosen traffic light classification to indicate the sustainability performance is a conceptual and subjective approach to harmonize and standardize heterogenetic data. However, it does not allow to draw conclusion on the scientific strength of evidence and should therefore be interpreted with caution. We further did not conduct a risk of bias assessment of the included studies. This is in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, which state that scoping reviews are not intended to critically appraise the risk of bias of a cumulative body of evidence but to present results and guide future systematic reviews and meta-analyses66.\nAs previously outlined by Herrero et al.5, the rapid development of FSTs and their expected impact on different pillars of sustainability requires improved multi-indicator sustainability assessment to reduce the risks of unintended trade-offs5. It would be useful to develop a comprehensive inventory of sustainability indicators that can be selected from for the assessment of respective FSTs to determine the most sustainable alternative option in a given context. For this purpose, the results of this review and other studies that provide an overview of metrics to assess sustainability in the food sector can be used8,53. This scoping review reveals important evidence gaps on the four included FSTs that targeted empirical assessments should aim to fill. The literature on PBAs sustainability is widespread, but there is a need to study the performance and implications of the growing market of seafood analogues. More analyses should also be conducted comparing PBAs against other alternatives such as tofu or insects to determine the most sustainable protein and fat alternatives. Studies comparing existing PBAs are also of relevance to determine the most sustainable commodity and production processes. Finally, longitudinal and controlled dietary studies comparing the nutritional and epidemiological effects of substituting animal products with alternative protein sources over the long term are needed.\nGiven the often-emphasized potential of vertical farms to contribute to more resilient food supply chains, it is necessary to assess their socio-economic implications and evaluate the efficiency and benefit for different geospatial and cultural contexts.\nFor FD, their scaling and rapid development needs to be assessed from public health, socio-economic and environmental perspectives beyond GHGe (for example, air pollution from transportation) to inform governmental policies and urban planning processes and guide more sustainable practices.\nTo validate the promise of BT for a sustainable, effective and efficient food supply chain, it would be important to empirically assess whether food traceability actually improves agricultural sustainability and to what extent.\nWe synthesized empirical evidence indicating the sustainability of four representative FSTs and found varying levels of performances across different indicators and pillars. We identified considerably more evidence on the sustainability performance of PBAs than for VF and FD, with no empirical evidence found for BT. In general, these FSTs have the potential to support parts of the transformation towards a sustainable food system and enhance human health. However, unintended side effects are often inherent to deploying innovations. Guiding transformative investments necessitates a more rigorous, quantitative assessment of the sustainability implications of FSTs, encompassing broad environmental, economic and social indicators, to safeguard against undesirable effects. We hope that the findings of this review provide a starting point to build such a sustainability assessment framework to assess recently introduced FSTs, to inform political guidelines and to guide the development of and investments into long-term sustainable solutions. The inventory of FSTs is long, and future research is required to provide regional context specific recommendations and inform policy guidelines. This will have to include socio-economic sustainability impact factors to ensure that they contribute to a just transformation of the food system.\nScoping reviews are well suited to study the breadth of an area that has not been reviewed comprehensively before to provide a detailed and structured overview of the reviewed literature and to identify research gaps in the existing literature67. We followed the PRISMA guidelines extension for scoping reviews and provide the detailed checklist in the Supplementary Material Section166. Searches in the databases Web of Science Core Collection and Scopus were carried out in September 2021 to identify peer-reviewed literature. We included literature published from 2016 as there was an exponential rise in scientific literature focusing on these four FSTs since then (Extended data Fig.1). Further details on the literature review are given in Supplementary Material Section3.\nWe used CADIMA68for study screening and duplicate removal. To check for selection consistency among all researchers, an initial consistency check was conducted by independently screening a certain number of articles (5%\u2009=\u200957) and discussing potential divergencies. Once consistency was achieved, one reviewer (A.C.B.) screened the remaining articles at the title and abstract stage against the eligibility criteria. Full-text screening was performed by three reviewers independently: A.C.B. (80%), A.W. (10%) and L.J.G. (10%). Where inconclusive or contradictory assessments emerged, they were discussed and resolved with all authors at both abstract and full-text screening stage.\nAs a primary inclusion criterion for this review, the studies had to assess the sustainability of one of the four selected FSTs as defined in the conceptual framework (Fig.1). We exclusively searched for PBAs that are designed to mimic conventional animal-based products and hence excluded cellular meat, insect-based food products and traditional fermented legumes. We also excluded literature focusing on non-vertical aqua or hydroponical systems and the application of BT to non-food sectors. Included studies had to provide quantification for at least one indicator of sustainability. An exception was made for blockchain literature, as we found there is yet limited empirical evidence available. Hence, the blockchain literature only had to provide a narrative description on at least one indicator of sustainability. We included peer-reviewed case studies and reviews that provide a quantification; subjective studies that do not use data to back up the assessment of indicators or conference proceedings were excluded. No geographical limits were imposed, but only English literature was included. Eligibility criteria are detailed in the Supplementary Material Section3.\nWe devised the search strategy to reflect concepts of sustainability assessment and the four selected FSTs. Search strings were tested several times against a set of predefined benchmark articles.\nData charting was done for all included articles between October and December 2021 by one author with feedback on the process by all authors. We charted data on study design, study location, sustainability indicators assessed, methods, LCA assumptions and results indicating the sustainability performance (Supplementary Data). The fact that no defined inventory of indicators spanning all dimensions of sustainability exists posed an inherent challenge to the search for and selection of them. We therefore used a combined deductive and inductive approach to extract all sustainability indicators encountered in the literature and discussed inclusion among all study authors. Detailed outline on the search strategy and the data-charting process is provided in Supplementary Material Sections3and4.\nPerforming a meta-analysis on the results of included studies was not applicable due to cross-study, cross-FST and methodological inconsistencies across sustainability indicators. However, to translate the results of the included studies into comparable quantitative representation, we developed a coding scheme, classifying the level of agreement on the sustainability performance per study, FST and sustainability indicator. For that step, only studies that performed a comparison against the baseline scenario they intend to replace have been included (PBA\u2009=\u200927, VF\u2009=\u200910, FD\u2009=\u20093). Blockchain literature was not applicable for that assessment. We defined baseline scenarios in this context as animal-based products for PBA, on-field and in-greenhouse cultivation for VF, and individual grocery retail or restaurant dining for FD.\nTo assess the sustainability performance of FSTs compared with the baseline scenarios, we extracted study results and coded the level of performance using the traffic light approach. A higher level of performance was assigned if they scored better (green), a similar performance (yellow) if there was no difference assessed by the respective study, or a lower performance (red) if they scored worse compared with the baseline scenario. We coded every FST that has been assessed in the included literature and compared against a baseline scenario. When different functional unit and system boundary assumptions were applied in one study, we extracted results for each assumption to reduce bias due to modelling choices. Results of the performance analysis stratified by system boundaries and functional units are presented in Supplementary Material Section6. Duplicates have been removed.\nFurther information on research design is available in theNature Research Reporting Summarylinked to this article.\nAll data generated or analysed during this study is available in theSupplementary Dataof this article or publicly available athttps:\/\/doi.org\/10.5281\/zenodo.6550444under a CC-BY-4.0 licence.

Here, for 194 countries we combine aquatic food production, distribution and consumption data with corresponding national policy documents and, drawing on theories of social justice, explore whether barriers to participation explain unequal distributions of benefits. Using Bayesian models, we find economic and political barriers are associated with lower wealth-based benefits; countries produce and consume less when wealth, formal education and voice and accountability are lacking. In contrast, social barriers are associated with lower welfare-based benefits; aquatic foods are less affordable where gender inequality is greater. Our analyses of policy documents reveal a frequent failure to address political and gender-based barriers. However, policies linked to more just food system outcomes centre principles of human rights, specify inclusive decision-making processes and identify and challenge drivers of injustice.\nThe global food system has supported the accumulation of vast quantities of wealth, most notably over the past half-century through the corporatization of agriculture and fisheries1. Food systems also support the livelihoods of nearly a third of the world\u2019s population and provide food\u2014a basic need and human right\u2014to all2. While global production, trade and consumption of food have escalated, these sectors have grown increasingly concentrated2and the number of people who are food insecure continues to rise, with one in four people now food insecure3. These food system inequities are further exacerbated by contemporary global crises\u2014such as climate change, conflict and pandemics\u2014a pattern laid bare by COVID-19 causing near-doubling of the number of people experiencing \u2018crisis level\u2019 hunger3,4,5. Consequently, the need for transformation towards a more just and sustainable food system is undeniable3.\nTransformation towards a more just global food system requires broad-scale engagement with concepts of justice and equity. Justice broadly means \u2018parity of participation\u2019, based on the principle of equal moral worth6. Injustices are thus understood to exist where institutionalized structures create barriers that impede full participation across society6, resulting in the greatest burdens or benefits falling on particular social groups7. Injustices in food systems manifest in diverse ways; from the egregious human rights violations associated with slavery at sea8, to the negative health outcomes, such as malnutrition and maternal and child mortality, associated with a lack of food4. Struggles for justice have most often played out within territorial frames6. However, for globally connected systems, barriers to participation are increasingly constructed across national and international scales. The resulting global scope of injustice therefore necessitates global analyses6,7,9.\nAnalyses of injustice tend to encompass three interdependent dimensions: distributional, recognitional and representational or procedural justice6,7. Distributional injustices emerge when economic structures, such as class, mean that some people lack the resources needed to fully participate. Recognitional injustices emerge when social or cultural structures, such as gender, do not value or recognize certain identities, making it harder for them to participate as equals. Representational injustices emerge when political structures, that establish whose voice counts in decision-making, prevent some people from participating fully7. All three dimensions are relational and interact with one another to create unequal distributions of benefits (and burdens) and exacerbate conditions such that some social groups lose out, in terms of resources and power, whereas others gain.\nHere, we develop a mixed-methods approach (Fig.1) that draws on a three-dimensional justice lens6,7and uses data from 2006 to 2016 on food system benefits and associated national policies of 194 countries, to evaluate inequalities and injustices. Such an approach, through its focus on barriers as the conditions of injustice, can also illuminate how injustices can be resolved. We focus on the highly traded10, socially valuable11,12,13, aquatic food system, which although characteristic of many food systems is only recently gaining attention.\nThis diagram distinguishes between equality and justice and describes how the research questions draw on three dimensions of social justice14,15to guide the analysis and implications for aquatic food policy.\nFocusing on three aquatic food system benefits associated with production (quantity of food produced), distribution (value of export revenues) and consumption (dietary supply of protein) of aquatic foods and using the Gini index14, we found that aquatic food system benefits were distributed highly unequally across countries (Fig.2). Distributions in the quantity of food produced (Gini\u2009=\u20090.76, where 1 is perfectly unequal) (Fig.2a) and value of export revenues (Gini\u2009=\u20090.90) (Fig.2b) were more unequal than income (Gini\u2009=\u20090.65)15. A few high-income countries, including Iceland and Norway, produced the most per worker (253 and 171\u2009t\u2009worker\u22121yr\u22121, respectively) (Fig.2aandSupplementary Data; ref.16) despite China, India and Indonesia, where most fish workers live10,11, dominating total production (Supplementary Data; ref.16). High-income or island nations, including Iceland, Norway and Seychelles, dominate per capita export revenue (Fig.2bandSupplementary Data; ref.16), whereas the quantities of aquatic foods exported are greatest in resource-rich countries, with large Economic Exclusive Zones (EEZ), such as China, Norway and Peru, which together account for 23% of global exports by volume (Supplementary Data; ref.16). As a group, aquatic foods are among the most highly traded food commodities, in part due to the increasing commodification of fishery products and the rise of foreign processing17. Between 1994 and 2012, global seafood trade nearly doubled18, generating over US$164\u2009billion globally in export revenues in 2018 (ref.10). This growth in seafood trade may have exacerbated inequalities19, as globally traded aquatic foods interact with domestic markets and small-scale fisheries by diverting products to foreign markets and through competition with imported products20. However, these interactions are not universal and the impacts are context-dependent.\na\u2013c, Global distribution of production (t\u2009worker\u22121yr\u22121) (n=\u2009144) (a), exports (US$\u2009capita\u22121yr\u22121) (n=\u2009188) (b) and aquatic protein supply (g\u2009capita\u22121d\u22121) (n=\u2009167) (c), represented as global map with insert for Lorenz curves with Gini coefficients. Grey colour represents countries with missing data.\nConsumption of aquatic foods (as protein supply) was more equally distributed than production or export revenues but still exhibited high inequality (Gini\u2009=\u20090.46; Fig.2c). Aquatic food consumption comprises around 17% of animal protein consumption globally10,16. The highest levels of consumption were found in island nations across the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans, including the Maldives, Iceland and Kiribati (47, 27, 24\u2009g\u2009capita\u22121d\u22121of protein, respectively) (Supplementary Data; ref.16). In comparison, for 100 countries (60%) consumption was below the global average of 5.5\u2009g\u2009capita\u22121d\u22121of protein (Supplementary Data; ref.16). Because there are limits to how much someone can eat, the range of consumption values is smaller than the range of values for production and trade, which partly explains the more equal distribution. However, small increases, or decreases, in consumption of aquatic foods can substantially impact nutrition. This is particularly true in low-income countries21,22where up to 845\u2009million people depend on aquatic foods as a critical source of essential micronutrients12,13but where supply is at, or close to, levels needed to meet requirements for a healthy diet21. The emerging emphasis on aquatic foods as a healthy and sustainable alternative to meat could undermine this potential if aquatic foods flow increasingly towards high- and middle-income consumers and countries23.\nTo evaluate awareness of barriers to participation within national aquatic food policy, we conducted eight expert interviews to identify terms that reflect economic (for example, wealth), social (for example, gender) or political barriers (for example, voice) and policy concepts (for example, social security) that seek to address these barriers (Supplementary Table2). We then used these terms and concepts in a summative content analysis24conducted on 173 countries aquatic food production-related (for example, fisheries and aquaculture) and consumption-related (for example, food and nutrition security) policy documents, comprising 306 enacted laws and policies in total (Methods). We found globally that policies were most likely to recognize or seek to address economic barriers, most often related to wealth and trade (Fig.3and Supplementary Table3). This policy orientation was particularly true for southern Africa (Fig.3), a region with some of the highest levels of income inequality in the world25. Overall, policies were least likely to recognize or seek to address political barriers (Fig.3).\nAverage number of references made to economic, social and political barriers in enacted national policy documents (n=\u2009306). Petal diagrams describe the average number of references per page across UN subregions. Colours: dark blue, Africa; light blue, Oceania; yellow, Europe; orange, Caribbean; green, Americas; purple, Asia. Grey colour represents countries with missing data.\nWe found considerable variation in attention given to social barriers, including gender and age (Fig.3and Supplementary Table3). Policies from eastern Africa and southern and western Asia, where prevalence of malnutrition is high and a particular concern for women and children4, contained the most frequent references to social barriers, in particular age (Fig.3). In contrast, policies from eastern Europe contained the fewest (Fig.3). References to social barriers were particularly low across production-related policies where on average fewer than 0.1 references were made, per page, compared to over ten times more (1.2) in consumption-related policy documents (Supplementary Table3). This suggests a broad failure within production-related policies to recognize and account for differences in social identity (for example, gender and age). Fifty-three and 84 (20% and 30%) countries\u2019 production policies made no reference to age or gender, respectively, compared to only three and nine countries\u2019 consumption policies (Supplementary Data), highlighting the slow progress in moving beyond gender-blind production-related policies26. Yet, global prevalence of child labour remains high27and ample evidence exists that gender norms and social constraints limit aquatic food system actors from participating equally28.\nHistorical and sociocultural differences in how production and consumption sectors are perceived26,29, have created little overlap between sectors in awareness of barriers, reflecting a lack of institutional coordination. Differences were particularly stark in some geographies. For example, production-related policies from Vietnam and the Democratic Republic of Congo made some of the most frequent references to economic barriers and least frequent to social barriers. Conversely, their consumption-related policies were amongst the least likely to reference economic barriers and most likely to reference social barriers. Consumption-related policies from Bangladesh and Australia similarly make some of the most frequent references to social barriers but their production-related policies make the fewest (Supplementary Data).This focus, on overcoming economic barriers in the production of aquatic foods and social barriers in the consumption of aquatic foods, rather than removing barriers to access, is likely to reinforce divisions of labour that are shaped by traditional social and cultural norms29. Greater investments in mother- and child-focused health probably account for differences between production- and consumption-related policies30. However, differences across sectors in awareness of, and efforts to address, barriers can also present an opportunity for cross-sector policy engagement to embed gender and broader socially sensitive strategies into production policies.\nWe developed a series of Bayesian models (Methods) to establish whether unequal distributions of benefits in the global aquatic food system are associated with barriers to participation, reflecting injustices. We focus on seven economic, social and political barriers to participation and eight production, distribution and consumption benefits from aquatic food systems. Because food system distributions can also result from natural variations in resource endowments9,31, in each model we control for relevant biophysical and geographic variables (for example, EEZ area and climatic zone) that are known to influence the overall size of benefits but are not relevant to our analysis of barriers.\nWe found that when economic barriers were lower, characterized by wealthier countries with greater levels of educational attainment, aquatic food consumption per capita and production per worker was higher (Fig.4). Indeed, increases in fish consumption are often attributed to increases in income32. In contrast, when economic barriers are higher, characterized by lower educational attainment, we find that diets are more dependent on aquatic foods, aquatic foods are more nutritious and jobs more dependent on the aquatic food system (Fig.4). Together, this suggests that economic barriers are associated with distributional injustices that limit wealth-based benefits but create welfare-based dependencies with livelihoods more dependent on the aquatic food system; dynamics that can lead to poverty traps33.\nStandardized effect sizes for the influence of economic, social and political barriers on aquatic food benefits. \u2018Employment (women)\u2019 refers to women\u2019s employment only in the direct sector. Parameter estimates are median values of Bayesian posterior distributions. Darker shaded circles indicate that 90% of credible intervals do not overlap 0 and that the estimate was either positive (blue) or negative (red). Lighter shaded circles indicate that 50% of credible intervals do not overlap with 0 and that the estimate was either positive (blue) or negative (red). White circles indicate that 50% of credible interval overlap 0. Thick and thin horizontal lines are 50% and 90% credible intervals. For all models,n=\u2009195.\nEconomic and political barriers often co-occurred to create distributional and representational injustices that reinforced a wealth\u2013welfare divide across the aquatic food system (Fig.4). Greater wealth-based benefits, including greater production, export and consumption of aquatic foods, were found where political barriers were lower, characterized by high levels of voice and accountability (that is, democratic processes and freedom of expression). In contrast, where political barriers, due to the lack of voice and accountability, were present, more jobs (including for women) and more affordable aquatic foods were evident (Fig.4). Policies capable of addressing economic and political barriers to participation are desirable; however, global aquatic food system dynamics have created welfare-based dependencies that limit the potential to escape poverty33. Care is thus needed to ensure that the welfare functions, crucial to food and nutrition security, are not undermined34.\nIn contrast to economic and political barriers that limit wealth-based benefits, social barriers tended to limit welfare-sustaining benefits. For example, where gender-based barriers were lower (greater gender equality), aquatic foods were more affordable (Fig.4). Indeed, gender and development research show that if women had equal access to productive assets and resources and were free from other gendered constraints, the number of food-insecure people could be reduced by up to 17% (ref.35). Similarly, where linguistic diversity, a proxy for cultural diversity36, was higher aquatic food systems supported more jobs, although exported less (Fig.4). Diverse cultures are more likely to reflect a diversity of practices37that support a larger workforce, whereas homogenous cultures may have more specialized production practices that support fewer jobs but, in the current system, have greater export potential34. Many low-income countries look to exports to generate economic growth38. However, trade-induced economic growth will only benefit domestic food and nutrition security if countries can absorb the excess labour force and have policies that redistribute export revenues in a just manner, domestically34. Indeed, the tensions between welfare-sustaining (for example, local jobs and affordable nutrition) and wealth-generating (for example, revenue and profit) contributions from aquatic foods have led global food justice and food sovereignty movements to push back against the increasingly global and lucrative trade in aquatic foods, to advocate for greater support for domestic markets, household production and local domestic consumption39. National food policy therefore needs to balance support for diverse production systems that sustain jobs and are likely to be more resilient40with export-led economic growth that risks undermining the welfare functions of aquatic food systems41.\nA positive deviance approach has been used previously in nutrition and marine research to identify and learn from places performing better than expected42. We drew on this approach to identify, for each of five benefits and given barriers present, the 12 countries securing considerably more and considerably less aquatic food benefits than expected. Selections were based on the largest standard deviations from our Bayesian models (Methods). We then qualitatively analysed the content of the resultant policies of countries to establish how barriers are addressed and consequently how national policy can better support justice in aquatic food systems. Although the content of policy documents does not always reflect practices on the ground43, it can help to create the conditions for more positive change.\nPolicies differed considerably in how (Table1) and how often (Fig.3) they engaged with social barriers. Since social barriers limit welfare-based production and consumption benefits (Fig.4), differences in policy engagement with barriers were associated with outcomes (Table1). For example, in Bangladesh and Gambia where aquatic food outcomes were greater than expected, nutrition policies clearly centred principles of justice and human rights, often starting with a declaration such as \u2018Nutrition also is a basic human right\u2019 (Table1). These policies also endorsed wider responsibility for change by challenging unequal gender norms and envisioning new ones; such as promoting \u2018male participation in the provision of nutritional care and support for women and their families\u2019 (Table1). In contrast, policies from countries with lower-than-expected aquatic food outcomes tended to interpret social barriers narrowly or in ways that risked reinforcing unequal social norms and harmful stereotypes. For example, policies that stated \u201c[these] risks may then be compounded [...]; which will lead to another generation of malnourished mothers, who will in turn replicate the cycle\u201d (Table1), implicitly position women at the centre of cycles of intergenerational undernutrition and poverty and risk repeating widespread policy failures that inadvertently lay the blame44or place the burden for change45on women, the marginalized or poor. Policies that centre principles of justice and human rights and open up spaces to challenge norms that create constraints, without reinforcing stereotypes, can support more just food systems; strategies that are now recognized as effective levers of change28.\nRedistributive approaches were frequently used to address economic barriers, that limit wealth-based benefits. For example, the fisheries policies of the Philippines, Peru and Liberia, grant small-scale fisheries and aquaculture workers preferential access to credit or exclusive access to fishing grounds (Table1). Although economic barriers are most frequently addressed in national policies (Fig.3), nations securing more aquatic food benefits than expected went further in their redistributive policies to make the case for justice claims, clearly outlining how structural drivers such as poverty and gender norms shape, intersect and reinforce unjust outcomes. For example, the Philippines nutrition policy acknowledged that women who were \u201cnutritionally vulnerable [and] from poor families and communities have less access to resources and services\u201d (Table1). Such redistributive justice claims that clearly acknowledge the causes of injustice can avoid inadvertently promoting destructive notions such as the \u2018undeserving poor\u201946. Political barriers, which also limit wealth-based benefits (Fig.3), were in contrast least likely to be mentioned, particularly in consumption-related policies; however, the nutrition policy of Liberia was an exception, exemplifying downward accountability (Table1). Other exceptions were from countries that secured more aquatic food benefits than expected, whose fishery policies outlined clear processes for inclusive decision-making that looked to support equal opportunities and build accountability (Table1), highlighting the potential for inclusive decision-making processes to support more just food systems.\nAquatic foods are critical to health, economies and livelihoods10,12but economic, social and political barriers mean their benefits are unevenly accessed, leading to costly unmet nutritional needs. Policies can steer food systems towards more parity in access to productive, affordable and nutritious foods. Five policy recommendations emerge from this work that can help support justice across aquatic food systems. These recommendations are not exhaustive and, because injustices are intersecting, multidimensional and cross-scale6, apply both nationally and beyond national boundaries. Overall, we found that more just aquatic food policies:\nCentred principles of justice and human rights47and challenged existing social norms28; in doing so, these policies seek to minimize social barriers and support welfare-based benefits of aquatic foods without placing the burden of change on the disadvantaged45\nProvided clear guidance on inclusive decision-making processes and downward accountability to address political barriers and support more equal access to wealth-based benefits of aquatic foods\nIdentified and specified the structural drivers or conditions, of injustice, so that redistributive policies that address economic barriers and support more equal access to wealth-based benefits, can do so without inadvertently disempowering or \u2018moralizing\u2019, the disadvantaged46\nBuilt strong cross-sectoral engagement between production and consumption sectors48and supported colearning to develop policies that support more inclusive production practices and more representative consumption practices and in doing so avoid reinforcing harmful social norms\nRecognized the inherent tensions between wealth-generating and welfare-sustaining benefits, appreciating that this requires coordination and concession across scale, underscoring the importance of pan-national efforts, such as the Committee on World Food Security, to inform global negotiations and agreements47\nMoving towards a more just aquatic food system will require both a renewed emphasis on justice in policy formulation and increased investment by states and their development partners in supporting governance reform in the sector23,48. These actions will help to ensure that the benefits of aquatic foods are more equitably distributed and accessible to populations that need them most.\nWe develop a mixed-methods approach to examine aquatic foods through a three-dimensional justice lens6,7(Fig.1). We first use a Gini coefficient14to quantify how (un)equally benefits are distributed (Fig.2). Next, we combine expert interviews with a summative content analysis24of national production and consumption-related policies49to quantify the extent to which policies recognize economic, social and political barriers to participation (Fig.3). Third, we develop a series of Bayesian hierarchical models50to establish whether economic, social or political barriers are associated with the unequal patterns of distribution (Fig.4). Finally, we combine a positive deviance (or positive outlier) approach42,51, to identify countries securing considerably more (and less) aquatic food system benefits than expected given the barriers present, with an interpretative policy content analysis24, to qualitatively analyse the content of their national production- and consumption-related policies and identify policy actions likely to support more just food system outcomes (Table1).\nWe focus on three aquatic food system benefits (quantity of food produced, value of exports and quantity of food consumed (SupplementaryMethods)) and use a Gini index14to examine how unequal the distributions of benefits are across country. For each variable we plot the Lorenz curve and calculate the unweighted Gini coefficient using the R package reldist (Fig.2). Gini coefficients represent the area between a line of equality and a curve of the benefit distribution when plotting the cumulative share of the population versus the cumulative share of the benefit. The unweighted Gini coefficient applied to per capita estimates of benefits measures between-nation inequality in the distribution of benefits, aligning with the response variables in our subsequent Bayesian models below. We plotted values for production (t\u2009worker\u22121), distribution (US$\u2009capita\u22121) and consumption (g\u2009capita\u22121d\u22121) by nation to visualize patterns globally.\nWe first conducted eight guided expert interviews with academics and practitioners working in aquatic food systems to: (1) identify policy (and legal) documents; (2) identify terminology, which when used in policy documents suggests recognition of or engagement with economic, social or political barriers to participation; and (3) conceptualize policy attributes likely to be used in efforts to overcome barriers faced by different social groups in accessing benefits associated with aquatic food systems. Academics and practitioners (some of whom are co-authors) were identified through our networks to cover a range of geographies (South America, Africa, United States, Asia and Global) and areas of expertise (fisheries, aquaculture, public health, development and trade). Ethics was granted through the Lancaster University ethics board to C.C.H., approval number FST18132.\nAll concepts identified in the interviews that either recognized or attempted to overcome a barrier were grouped thematically into the categories of barrier they were most closely associated with (Supplementary Table2). Economic barriers were thematically grouped as wealth, safety net policies and policies to improve market access and domestic trade. Social barriers were thematically grouped as gender, age and policies to support access to health for vulnerable populations. Political barriers were thematically grouped as human rights, access rights and participatory processes (Supplementary Table2). Although terms capturing cultural identity were specified (for example, groups capturing differences in ethnicity, religion, caste and race), these were not included in subsequent analyses as they tended to be geographically specific, making selection of representative terms, for a global analysis, impossible.\nWe next compiled 344 production- and consumption-associated policy and legal documents from 173 countries, written between 1991 and 2020 (SupplementaryMethods; ref.49). All documents were produced by national fisheries, agricultural, environmental and health agencies themselves or in conjunction with United Nations organizations including the World Health Organization and the Food and Agriculture Organization. These documents are not necessarily evidence of policies in practice but reflect prerequisite enabling conditions, recognizing that policy development and implementation take time and acknowledging that policies de jure are not necessarily de facto practices43. Furthermore, these documents are not exhaustive of all aquatic food policies but represent a comparable and nationally representative global sample of production and consumption policies to provide an indication of the levels of awareness of the challenges associated with social difference.\nWe finally, conducted a summative qualitative content analysis24to quantify the extent to which national policies recognize barriers to participation. We scanned all consumption-related policies in NVivo 2020 for terms that relate to aquatic foods (for example, fish and fisheries) (Supplementary Table2). Consumption policies that made no reference to aquatic food terms were removed from subsequent analysis. We autocoded the remaining 306 production and consumption policy documents in NVivo 2020 for terms (Supplementary Table2) capturing economic, social and political barriers identified through the expert interview. Analyses were conducted in five languages, covering 98% of all countries. For each policy, the number of references to each keyword was extracted and divided by the number of pages in the policy. For each theme (that is, wealth, safety nets, access to markets, age, gender, health- and nutrition-sensitive policies, human rights, access rights and representation), references per page were calculated by summing across all keyword references within a theme (for example, woman\u2009+\u2009maternal\u2009=\u2009gender) and averaging across policy type (consumption and production) (Supplementary Table3). The summarized keyword theme references per page were then merged with global shape files in the sf R package52(Fig.3; Supplementary Fig.5).\nWe draw on social justice theory, based on the principle of \u2018equal moral worth\u20196, to evaluate whether economic, social and political barriers to participation are associated with the unequal distributions of aquatic food systems benefits (Fig.2). To do so, we developed a series of Bayesian hierarchical models to establish whether seven indicators of economic (wealth and education), social (gender inequality, linguistic diversity, cultural hegemony and age) and political (voice and accountability) barriers, explain patterns of distribution for eight benefits\u2014production (quantity, quality, employment and women\u2019s employment), distribution (export revenues and affordability) and consumption (quantity and reliance) (Fig.4)\u2014while controlling for environmental, geographical and economic factors, that do not constitute barriers to participation but are likely to influence the benefit of interest (SupplementaryMethods, Supplementary Figs.1and2and Supplementary Table1).\nAlthough differences exist in how the production, distribution and consumption of aquatic foods have evolved across different countries associated with history, religion and culture that influence current production, distribution and consumption, these are beyond the scope of this study. Our analyses are therefore limited to an evaluation of current practices and not to disentangling historical patterns of evolution or their role in driving policy changes.\nBefore model development and for each of the eight aquatic food system benefits, we built a series of expert-informed directed acyclic graphs (DAGs)53(Supplementary Fig.2) to explore interactions between our dependent, independent and control variables. The purpose of using DAGs in this exercise is to identify otherwise invisible confounding, particularly collider, bias where two variables simultaneously act on a third and induce correlation among them53,54,55. Where colliders were found, they were removed to avoid inducing collider bias (see Pearl\u2019s DAG-based approach53) and remaining variables were checked for correlations between variables (Supplementary Fig.3). This DAG-based approach was developed to be more transparent about the underlying assumptions than including nuisance variables without checking for the range of confounding issues that they can induce. Because of the transparency of this approach, DAGS are often used for causal analyses; however, we do not use formal causal inference in this study.\nOur final DAGs, after removing colliders and highly correlated variables included 9 environmental, geographic and economic control variables (EEZ area, primary productivity, maximum inland water, climatic zone, capture production, aquaculture production, imports, exports and affordability) across 8 models (production, employment, women\u2019s employment, nutrient density, exports, affordability, consumption and reliance) (Supplementary Figs.1and2).\nAquatic food production is likely to be affected by natural productivity and the water available to produce aquatic foods. We therefore included EEZ area (km2), primary productivity (mg\u2009C\u2009m\u22122d\u22122) and maximum inundation area (1,000\u2009km2) in the model for production per worker. The nutrient quality of aquatic foods is likely to be influenced by climatic zones2, we therefore included climatic zones1in the model for nutrient quality. Employment, export revenues and affordability are likely to be affected by the size of the sector, we therefore included total capture production (t) and total aquaculture production (t) as the sum of marine, freshwater and brackish aquaculture production (t) in the models for total employment, women\u2019s employment, export revenues and affordability. Affordability of aquatic foods is in addition likely to be influenced by unit value of imports and exports. We therefore added unit export revenues (exports in US$1,000 divided by exports in tonnage) and unit import costs (imports in US$1,000 divided by imports in tonnage) to the model for aquatic food affordability. Consumption and reliance of aquatic foods are likely to be influenced by the relative affordability of aquatic foods, we therefore added fish relative caloric price (affordability) into the models for consumption of, and reliance on, aquatic foods.\nAfter we identified and selected our 8 dependent, 7 independent and 11 control variables (maximum of 4 for any given model) on the basis of the descriptions above and before the analysis, we first log-transformed highly skewed independent and control variables (wealth, EEZ area, maximum inundation area, capture production, aquaculture production, unit exports and unit imports). Then, we standardized all independent and control variables by centring at the mean with a unit standard deviation. Finally, we scaled all dependent variables by dividing by an interquartile range and multiplying by 100, so that we could use the same parameterization for prior distributions across all models.\nAll hierarchical models were specified with three levels: global, regional and national. For regions, we extended subregions defined by the United Nations into 22 finer regions (Australia and New Zealand, Polynesia, Northern Africa, Western Europe, Middle Africa, Southern America, Northern America, Eastern Africa, Southern Europe, Southeastern Asia, Eastern Asia, Northern Europe, Central America, Southern Asia, Western Africa, Eastern Europe, Caribbean, Melanesia, Micronesia, Central Asia, Southern Africa and Western Asia) to take into account cultural differences. In regioni, intercept\u03b20iwas drawn from a normal distribution (equation (1)) and standard deviation\u03c3iwas drawn from a gamma distribution (equation (2)) as:\nIn nationj, intercept\u03b20ijwas drawn from a normal distribution (equation (3)) with a regional mean and standard deviation as:\nThese intercepts were passed into a linear model (equation (4)):\nwhere\u03b2is a vector of coefficients andXis a design matrix with independents. Finally, the logarithm of the observed valueyijwas modelled using at-distribution, with\u03bc=\u03bcij,\u03c3=\u03c3errorandv=\u20095. The data likelihood was chosen by checking leave-one-out probability integral transform (LOO-PIT)55. LOO-PIT diagnoses whether future unobserved data will follow the same distribution of the observed data by applying probability integral transform to leave-one-out cross-validation and estimating a cumulative density distribution of the posterior predictive. Our results show uniform distributions (Supplementary Fig.4; also see Code availability), indicating proper model specifications. Global parameters were specified using weakly informative priors, with a normal distribution with\u03bc= 0 and\u03c3= 100 for\u03bc0and with a half-Cauchy distribution with\u03b2=\u20095 for\u03b10,\u03b20,\u03c30and\u03c3error. Missing independent and control variables were imputed from a covariance matrix with LKJ Cholesky covariance priors. For LKJ Cholesky distribution, we used\u03b7=\u20092 and standard deviation specified as an exponential distribution with\u03bb=\u20091. Log-transformed population was also included in the matrix, as it was correlated with some of the independent variables. For each model, the parameters were sampled using the NUTS algorithm over two chains with 5,000 sampling each in PyMC3 v.3.10.0 (ref.55) under Python v.3.8.0. Model convergence was supported by Gelman\u2013Rubin statistics (\\(\\hat R\\)) all close to 1 (ref.56).\nFocusing on production, employment, affordability, consumption and reliance as the outcomes most likely to be influenced by production- and consumption-related policies, we identified, for each, 12 outliers defined as the nations with the greatest (positive and negative) standard deviations. Positive outliers thus represent areas with better-than-expected aquatic food outcomes (for example, aquatic food is considerably more affordable than expected) given the barriers present and negative outliers are places with worse-than-expected outcomes (for example, aquatic food is considerably less affordable than expected). We used outputs from the Bayesian models on the standard deviation of each nation\u2019s intercept from the expected regional distribution (equation (2)). For each benefit, six \u2018positive\u2019 and six \u2018negative\u2019 outlier countries were identified (Supplementary Table4).\nWe then qualitatively analysed, in depth, the content of five randomly selected positive outlier country policies (Bangladesh, Gambia, Liberia, Peru and the Philippines) and three randomly selected negative outlier country policies (Ethiopia, Finland and Sudan) to understand how countries experiencing fewer injustices use terms that capture economic, social and political barriers in policy. We looked for evidence, depth and sophistication of engagement with distributional, representational and recognitional dimensions of justice and further coded for emergent themes demonstrating engagement across dimensions of justice and across sectors relevant to aquatic foods. Drawing on our guided interviews and iterative readings, we identified ten themes: three representing inadvertently damaging language, likely to translate to policy failings; and seven representing progressive language and context, likely to translate into policies capable of overcoming economic, social and political barriers (Table1).\nFurther information on research design is available in theNature Research Reporting Summarylinked to this article.\nAll data used to produce the results of our analysis are available in the SupplementaryInformationand on GitHub (https:\/\/github.com\/zachkoehn\/aquatic_food_justice_model), with the published version archived (https:\/\/doi.org\/10.5281\/zenodo.7035795).\nAll code used to produce the results of our analysis are available in the SupplementaryInformationand on GitHub (https:\/\/github.com\/zachkoehn\/aquatic_food_justice_model), with the published version archived (https:\/\/doi.org\/10.5281\/zenodo.7035795).\nMcMichael, P. inNew Directions in the Sociology of Global Development(eds Buttel, F.

This impairs target setting and investment in evidence-based actions to support healthy sustainable diets. Here we quantified global, regional and national dietary patterns among children and adults, by age group, sex, education and urbanicity, across 185 countries between 1990 and 2018, on the basis of data from the Global Dietary Database project. Our primary measure was the Alternative Healthy Eating Index, a validated score of diet quality; Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension and Mediterranean Diet Score patterns were secondarily assessed. Dietary quality is generally modest worldwide. In 2018, the mean global Alternative Healthy Eating Index score was 40.3, ranging from 0 (least healthy) to 100 (most healthy), with regional means ranging from 30.3 in Latin America and the Caribbean to 45.7 in South Asia. Scores among children versus adults were generally similar across regions, except in Central\/Eastern Europe and Central Asia, high-income countries, and the Middle East and Northern Africa, where children had lower diet quality. Globally, diet quality scores were higher among women versus men, and more versus less educated individuals. Diet quality increased modestly between 1990 and 2018 globally and in all world regions except in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, where it did not improve.\nPoor diet is a leading cause of disease worldwide, responsible for an estimated 26% of global preventable mortality1,2,3,4. While individual foods and nutrients are important, overall dietary patterns are more strongly associated with health5. Evidence supports interactive and synergistic relationships between foods and nutrients when consumed together6, resulting in complementary effects5. While the various components of an optimal dietary pattern are well established and validated7, the distributions of such patterns globally are not well characterized. This is particularly true for children and adolescents, among whom global dietary patterns have not previously been reported.\nPrevious dietary studies have been limited to small subsets of countries8,9, used national per capita food availability or sales data as direct data inputs10,11,12,13,14, which substantially misestimate intake compared with individual-level data15and did not include children, adolescents or young adults (<25\u2009years old)8,9,10,11,12,16. Additionally, there is a paucity of evidence on global disparities in dietary patterns, for example by age, sex, education and urbanicity. Also, no previous global studies have jointly assessed several validated metrics of diet quality17, such as the Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI), the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and the Mediterranean Diet Score (MED).\nIn this Article, to address these gaps in knowledge, we characterized global, regional and national dietary patterns and trends on the basis of individual-level intake data among both adults and children from 185 countries in 1990 and 2018. Findings were further assessed by age, sex, education and urbanicity within each country. This analysis utilized the latest Global Dietary Database (GDD) 2018 data, based on individual-level dietary surveys around the world18.\nThe GDD is a collaborative effort to systematically identify, compile and standardize individual-level dietary data on 53 foods, beverages and nutrients (Methods). The GDD uses Bayesian modelling methods to estimate dietary intakes jointly stratified by age, sex, education, level and urbanicity for 185 countries between 1990 and 2018.\nIn 2018, the global mean of the AHEI score was 40.3 (95% uncertainty interval (UI) 39.4, 41.3), with regional means ranging from 30.3 (28.7, 32.2) in Latin America and the Caribbean to 45.7 (43.8, 49.3) in South Asia (Fig.1). Among components of the score, highest global scores for healthier items were for legumes\/nuts (5.0; 4.8, 5.3), followed by whole grains (4.7; 4.5, 5.0), seafood omega-3 fat (4.2; 3.8, 5.1) and non-starchy vegetables (3.9; 3.8, 4.0); among unhealthier items, highest scores (lowest or most favourable intakes) were for sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) (5.8; 5.7, 5.9) and red\/processed meat (4.8; 4.5, 5.1). However, these score components varied substantially by world region. For example, top scores in South Asia were for higher whole grains and lower red\/processed meat and SSBs, while top scores in Latin American and the Caribbean were for higher legumes\/nuts and lower sodium.\nAHEI score: nine components scored from 0 to 10 each and scaled to ten components (correction fortransfat shown). Healthy components: fruit, non-starchy vegetables, legumes\/nuts, whole grains, PUFAs and seafood omega-3 fat; unhealthy components: red\/processed meat, SSBs and sodium.\nOnly ten countries, representing <1% of the world\u2019s population, had AHEI scores \u226550. Among the world\u2019s 25 most populous countries, the mean AHEI score was highest in Vietnam, Iran, Indonesia and India (54.5 to 48.2) and lowest in Brazil, Mexico, the United States and Egypt (27.1\u201333.5) (Fig.2). Most component scores varied substantially across these populous countries. For example, a 100-fold difference was seen in the sodium score, a 90-fold difference in the red\/processed meat score and a 23-fold difference in the SSB score. Among the components, the polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) and non-starchy vegetable scores varied the least (two-fold and three-fold, respectively) across populous countries.\nChildren: \u22641\u2009years to \u226419\u2009years; adults: \u226520\u2009years. The AHEI score ranged from 0 to 100. The mean national score was computed as the sum of the stratum-level component scores and aggregated to the national mean using weighted population proportions for 2018.\nGlobally, the mean AHEI score in 2018 was similar among children (39.2; 38.2, 40.3) versus adults (40.8; 39.8, 42.0) (Fig.1). However, the mean AHEI score was substantially higher among adults compared with children in Central\/Eastern Europe and Central Asia, high-income countries, and the Middle East and Northern Africa region. By age, most regions had J- or U-shaped relationships, with the highest scores observed among the youngest (\u22645\u2009years) and\/or oldest age groups (\u226575\u2009years) (Fig.3).\nThe AHEI score ranged from 0 to 100. The circles represent the global or regional mean for the age group, and the error bars represent the corresponding 95% UI. The mean and its UI are plotted for the midpoint of each age group (<1, 1\u20132, 3\u20134, 5\u20139, 10\u201314, 15\u201319, 20\u201324, 25\u201329, 30\u201334, 35\u201339, 40\u201344, 45\u201349, 50\u201354, 55\u201359, 60\u201364, 65\u201369, 70\u201374, 75\u201379, 80\u201384, 85\u201389, 90\u201394 and \u226595\u2009years).\nAmong the AHEI components globally, four component scores were lower among children versus adults: fruit (2.2 (2.1, 2.3) versus 2.5 (2.4, 2.5), respectively), non-starchy vegetables (3.1 (3.0, 4.5) versus 4.3 (4.2, 3.2)), SSBs (5.3 (5.1, 5.5) versus 6.1 (6.0, 6.2)) and seafood omega-3 (3.3 (2.9, 4.0) versus 4.7 (4.2, 5.7)), while two others were higher among children versus adults: PUFAs (2.1 (2.0, 2.2) versus 1.4 (1.3, 1.5)) and sodium (4.6 (4.1, 5.1) versus 3.2 (2.9, 3.5)) (Fig.1).\nBy sex, the mean AHEI score was generally higher in women versus men globally and regionally, with the greatest differences seen in high-income countries (difference +4.4; 3.8, 5.0), and Central\/Eastern Europe and Central Asia (+3.6; 2.1, 5.3) (Extended Data Fig.1). Evaluating different AHEI components globally, women had modestly higher scores for fruit (+0.2; 0.2, 0.3), non-starchy vegetables (+0.3; 0.1, 0.4) and whole grains (+0.4; 0.2, 0.5).\nEvaluating differences according to educational attainment, AHEI scores were greater among individuals with a higher education level globally and in most regions, except in the Middle East and Northern Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa, where no differences were evident (Fig.4). Among world regions, differences by education were largest in Central\/Eastern Europe and Central Asia (+3.6; 2.4, 4.9), Latin America and the Caribbean (+3.5; 0.9, 6.0) and South Asia (+2.9; 1.1, 4.9). Globally, more educated individuals had higher scores for fruit (+0.8; 0.7, 0.9), sodium (+0.7; 0.3, 1.1), whole grains (+0.6; 0.4, 0.8) and non-starchy vegetables (+0.5; 0.4, 0.6). However, in contrast, more educated individuals also had lower scores (less favourable consumption levels) for red\/processed meat (\u22120.6; \u22120.7, \u22120.5), SSBs (\u22120.6; \u22120.8, \u22120.4) and nuts and legumes (\u22120.1; \u22120.2, \u22120.1) globally.\nAHEI score: nine components scored from 0 to 10 each and scaled to ten components (correction not shown). The absolute difference by education was computed as the difference at the stratum level and aggregated to the global and regional mean differences using weighted population proportions for low (<6\u2009years) and high education levels (\u226512\u2009years) only (excludes education level \u22656 and <12\u2009years).\nGlobally, AHEI scores did not significantly vary by urban versus rural residence (Fig.5). However, higher scores were evident among urban versus rural individuals in Central\/Eastern Europe and Central Asia (difference +2.2; 0.9, 3.5), and Southeast and East Asia (+1.4; 0.6, 2.4), and lower scores among urban versus rural individuals in the Middle East and Northern Africa (\u22123.8; \u22125.5, \u22122.2). Globally, individuals residing in urban areas had higher scores for fruit (+0.2; 0.2, 0.3) and whole grains (+0.2; 0.1, 0.4), but lower scores for SSBs (\u22120.5; \u22120.7, \u22120.4), red\/processed meat (\u22120.4, \u22120.5, \u22120.1) and legumes\/nuts (\u22120.1; \u22120.2, \u22120.1).\nAHEI score: nine components scored from 0 to 10 each and scaled to ten components (correction not shown). The absolute difference by urbanicity was computed as the difference at the stratum level and aggregated to the global and regional mean differences using weighted population proportions.\nBetween 1990 and 2018, the mean global AHEI score (standardized to 2018 population distributions) increased by +1.5 (1.0, 2.0). Increasing trends occurred in five of seven regions: Central\/Eastern Europe and Central Asia (+4.6; 4.0, 5.3); high-income countries (+3.2; 2.9, 3.5); Southeast and East Asia (+2.7; 1.7, 3.8); the Middle East and Northern Africa (+2.2; 1.4, 3.0); and Latin America and the Caribbean (+1.3; 0.6, 2.0). No significant change was seen in South Asia (0; \u22120.9, 1.1), and a decreasing trend was seen in Sub-Saharan Africa (\u22121.1; \u22121.8, \u22120.4) (Fig.6).\nAHEI score: nine components scored from 0 to 10 each and scaled to ten components (correction not shown). The absolute difference by time was computed as the difference at the stratum level and aggregated to the global and regional mean differences using weighted population proportions for 2018.\nAmong AHEI components globally, scores increased over time for non-starchy vegetables (+1.1; 1.0, 1.2), legumes\/nuts (+1.1; 1.0, 1.3) and fruit (+0.1; 0.1, 0.2); decreased for red\/processed meat (\u22121.4; \u22121.5, \u22121.2), SSBs (\u22120.6; \u22120.7, \u22120.6) and sodium (\u22120.4; \u22120.6, \u22120.2); and remained stable for whole grains (+0.1; 0, 0.2), PUFAs (0; 0, 0.1) and seafood omega-3 (0; 0, 0.1).\nAmong the most populous countries, the largest absolute improvement in the AHEI score between 1990 and 2018 occurred in Iran (+12.0; 9.9, 13.9), the United States (+4.6; 4.1, 5.1), Vietnam (+4.5; 2.4, 7.2) and China (+4.3; 2.8, 5.9), while the largest declines were found in Tanzania (\u22123.7; \u22125.8, \u22121.5), Nigeria (\u22123.0; \u22125.3, \u22120.7), Japan (\u22122.7; \u22123.1, \u22122.3) and the Philippines (\u22121.8; \u22122.7, \u22120.9) (Fig.7).\nThe AHEI score ranged from 0 to 100. The absolute difference between 2018 and 1990 was computed as the difference at the stratum level and aggregated to the national mean differences using weighted population proportions for 2018.\nDetailed findings for the DASH and MED scores are presented inSupplementary Information. Briefly, global mean DASH and MED scores in 2018 were 22.9 (22.6, 23.2) and 4.1 (3.9, 4.2), respectively (Extended Data Figs.2and3). Regionally, means for these scores were consistently higher in South Asia, and lower in Latin America and the Caribbean (Extended Data Figs.4and5). Among population subgroups, global DASH and MED scores were higher among adults compared with children (DASH: 23.2 (22.9, 23.4) versus 22.3 (21.9, 22.7); MED: 4.3 (4.1, 4.4) versus 3.7 (3.5, 3.8)), but did not appreciably differ by sex (Extended Data Figs.2and3). Global mean scores were higher among more versus less educated individuals (difference +2.6 (2.3, 2.8) and +0.3 (0.2, 0.4), respectively) (Extended Data Fig.7), and, for DASH only, among urban versus rural individuals (+0.4; 0.2, 0.7) (Extended Data Fig.8). Worldwide, the mean DASH and MED scores increased modestly between 1990 and 2018, by +1.0 (0.8, 1.1) for DASH and +0.3 (0.2, 0.4) for MED (Extended Data Figs.6and9). Across strata in 2018, the inter-correlations of the dietary pattern scores were 0.8 for AHEI and DASH, 0.5 for AHEI and MED, and 0.6 for DASH and MED.\nIn this global assessment of different dietary patterns across 185 countries in 1990 and 2018, we found modest overall dietary quality, but with important variation by age, sex, education, urbanicity, time and world region, as well as by dietary component. These results, based on the systematic collection and standardization of more than 1,100 individual-level dietary surveys worldwide, provide the most current and comprehensive estimates of global, regional and national dietary quality among adults and children, in subgroups according to educational attainment and urban versus rural residence, and comparing three validated dietary patterns including the AHEI, DASH and MED17. These results have important implications for public health and inform priorities in each nation and subnational subgroup to improve nutrition security and health equity.\nAs one example, our findings highlight the regional differences between insufficient intakes of healthful foods versus excess intakes of unhealthful foods. For instance, the highest dietary pattern scores in 2018 were identified in low-income countries in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, where relatively low consumption of SSBs and red\/processed meats is consistent with national data on food or beverage volume sales19. However, consumption of healthy components, such as fruit, non-starchy vegetables, legumes\/nuts, seafood omega-3 fat and PUFAs, were also far from optimal in these nations. This suggests that a major focus on policies and innovations to increase intakes of produce, seafood and plant oils will have the largest impact on dietary quality in these countries.\nBy contrast, in high-income countries, Central\/Eastern Europe and Central Asia, and the Middle East and Northern Africa, increasing intakes of fruit, non-starchy vegetables, legumes\/nuts and whole grains have improved dietary quality over time, but have been offset by stable trends or only minor reductions in red\/processed meats, SSBs and sodium. We found that red\/processed meat and sodium have each significantly increased over time in Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean, consistent with previous nation-specific reports from China, Japan and Mexico20,21,22. These findings suggest that a dual focus on increasing healthful foods and lowering of harmful factors is essential in these regions, especially for nations in Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean.\nSeveral studies have documented that the AHEI is associated with the risk of non-communicable diseases23. For example, pooled findings from two US cohorts found a 24%, 33% and 6% reduction in the incidence of cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus and cancer, respectively, for the highest AHEI quintile (median 64.5) compared with the lowest quintile (median 36.9; comparable to the global mean in our study, 40.3 (95% UI 39.4, 41.3)) (ref.24). Cohorts have also found that a moderate increase (20-percentile increase) in the AHEI score during follow-up was associated with significantly lower risk of cardiovascular disease mortality and cancer mortality25. Similar relationships have been observed in France26, the United Kingdom27and Singapore28,29. Such associations suggest that the current quality of global diets identified in this study is leading to preventable chronic disease and mortality, and that modest improvements in dietary quality can contribute to reductions in fatal and non-fatal diet-related diseases over time.\nOur findings on global diet patterns among infants, children and adolescents have important implications for child nutrition and health. We found that diet quality was generally highest among infants and young children and worsened into adolescence, emphasizing the need for initiatives to aim to improve dietary quality in older children, as well as promote healthy eating habits in early childhood to translate into improved dietary quality in adolescence and adulthood. Although, diet quality was highest among children in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, we found that diet quality worsened or remained stable over time in these regions. Children with more educated parents had higher dietary quality in all regions except South Asia and the Middle East and Northern Africa, while better diet quality was found among children residing in urban areas in Central\/Eastern Europe and Central Asia and Southeast and East Asia, and rural areas in the Middle East and Northern Africa. Worse dietary quality in children is associated with stunting, cardiometabolic risk factors (for example, blood pressure, blood lipid levels, glucose control and obesity) and lower health-related quality of life30,31,32,33,34,35, and dietary habits and food preferences established during early life influence later habits throughout childhood and into adulthood36,37,38.\nDietary disparities by education or income level have been reported in specific, mostly high-income nations or selected groups of nations8,39,40,41, but not globally. Our findings demonstrate that more educated individuals had higher overall dietary quality in most, but not all, world regions, with largest impacts of education among nations in Central\/Eastern Europe and Central Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, and South Asia. We also identified key exceptions in the Middle East and Northern Africa, and Sub-Saharan Africa, where dietary quality did not vary by education level. Notably, higher education was generally linked to greater consumption of fruits, non-starchy vegetables, whole grains and plant oils, but not always to lower consumption of SSBs and red\/processed meat. Interestingly, urbanicity differentially influenced dietary quality in different world regions, with better dietary quality among urban versus rural residents in Central\/Eastern Europe and Central Asia and Southeast and East Asia, but the opposite in the Middle East and Northern Africa, related to specific differences in the consumption of the underlying healthful versus unhealthful components among urban versus rural residents in these regions.\nIn agreement with our earlier analysis of healthy and unhealthy dietary scores16, we found that, compared with lower-income countries, higher-income countries had better scores for healthy components (for example, fruit and whole grains) but worse scores for unhealthy components (for example, red\/processed meats and sodium).\nThis investigation has several strengths. Our data and findings build upon and expand the previous literature by including the largest number of individual-level dietary surveys, providing a more contemporary estimate of trends in global dietary quality and estimating global dietary quality in children and adolescents, which has not been previously reported. We included 1,139 dietary surveys, most of which were nationally representative and collected at the individual-level using 24\u2009h recalls or food-frequency questionnaires (FFQs). We standardized all data inputs including dietary factor definitions, units and age-specific energy adjustment, and incorporated Bayesian modelling with survey and country covariates to address heterogeneity and sampling and modelling uncertainty42. We assessed subnational differences by age, sex, education and urbanicity, including the first global estimates of dietary patterns by educational attainment and urban versus rural residence. We characterized three established metrics for diet quality, each validated against major health outcomes17, including the similarities and differences in global, regional and national dietary quality depending on the dietary metric.\nPotential limitations should be considered. While we made extensive efforts to minimize bias and incorporate heterogeneity and uncertainty, individual-level dietary data are subject to measurement errors, and survey availability was limited or incomplete for some nations, dietary factors, demographic groups and years16,42. For example, less than a quarter of surveys included data on children aged 3\u20139\u2009years and adults \u226585\u2009years. The Bayesian hierarchical models incorporated additional uncertainty to account for these limitations, but sampling and\/or information bias cannot be ruled out16. To allow for comparability between population subgroups, we standardized dietary intakes to 2,000\u2009kcal per day before computing the dietary patterns, but the unadjusted dietary intakes may be lower among populations with lower energy requirements (for example, infants and young children, and seniors) or higher among populations consuming >2,000\u2009kcal per day. We did not have information ontransfat (AHEI) or alcohol use (AHEI and MED), and our findings should be interpreted as dietary quality based on the other components of these scores. The dietary patterns selected (AHEI, MED and DASH) were originally developed and validated for adult populations in high-income countries but have been used to characterize dietary quality among children and seniors33,43,44. It is important to note that a single or suite of dietary metrics has not been developed or validated to assess micronutrient quality of the diet in all age groups17, and the AHEI, MED and DASH may be inadequately correlated with nutrients of concern, particularly among children and in low- and middle-income countries. Caution is warranted when interpreting the findings in relation to nutrient adequacy. However, in the absence of validated metrics for the double burden of malnutrition, the AHEI, MED and DASH are appropriate metrics for assessing dietary quality across populations17. We did not consider other, less validated dietary indices and scores16,17,45,46, which can be assessed once these have been better validated for use in diverse global populations.\nIn conclusion, we found global dietary quality to be only modest today, and with only some improvement, although inconsistent by world region, over the past three decades.\nThese results provide comprehensive global information about individual-level dietary patterns among children and adults, by age, sex, education and urbanicity. Our findings highlight the substantial variation in dietary quality and inform the need for specific national and subnational policies to improve nutrition security and nutrition equity.\nOur methods and findings for identifying dietary surveys, data extraction, standardization and harmonization, and modelling have been reported18,42,47,48. In brief, we systematically searched, identified and collated data from nationally and subnationally representative surveys (or local representative community surveys when national and subnational were not available) on individual-level dietary intakes, and for sodium intake, as well as additional biomarker surveys18,42. Household budget surveys were used rarely when individual-level dietary surveys were not identified for a populous country18,42. In total, we compiled data from 1,248 dietary surveys from 188 countries. Of these, 1,139 surveys from 175 countries (representing 7.46 billion of the world population in 2018) reported data on the nine foods, three beverages and six nutrients measured in the dietary pattern scores in the present analysis. Most surveys were nationally or subnationally representative (89.1%); used an FFQ (42.1%) or 24\u2009h recall (22.7%); included data on children (0\u201319\u2009years) (73.9%) and adults (\u226520\u2009years) (64.5%); and included data on urban and\/or rural residence (60.8%) (Supplementary Information Table4).\nFor each survey in the GDD, we obtained and assessed the credibility of information obtaining relating to survey characteristics, including survey name, country, years performed, sampling methods, response rate, national representativeness, level of data collection (individual or household), dietary assessment method and validation, sample size, population demographics (age, sex, education, urban\/rural residence and pregnancy\/lactation status) and definitions and units of dietary factors18. We also extracted or obtained directly from the survey owners data on individual-level dietary intakes of up to 53 foods, beverages and nutrients, jointly stratified by age, sex, education and urban\/rural residence. We evaluated dietary intakes adjusted to age-standardized energy intakes to assess dietary composition independently of quantity, account for estimated age-specific average requirements and reduce measurement error within and across surveys (Supplementary Information)42. Data were assessed for extraction errors and for plausibility using standardized protocols, and survey quality by evaluating evidence for selection bias, sample representativeness, response rate and validity of diet assessment method42.\nTo account for differences in survey methods, representativeness, time trends, input data and uncertainty, a Bayesian model estimated the log-means of dietary intake (mean and standard deviation) within a nested hierarchical structure42. The model included random effects by country and region as well as globally; sex, education, urban\/rural residence and non-linear age effects; survey-level indicator data for dietary assessment method (24\u2009h recall, FFQ, Demographic Health Survey questionnaire and household budget survey) and type of dietary metric (optimal or suboptimal definition); and national year-specific covariate data relevant to each dietary factor42. The model included overdispersion of study-level variance for surveys that were not nationally representative or not stratified by sex, education, urbanicity or small age groups (\u226410\u2009years)42.\nThe final model included estimates of consumption of each food or nutrient for 264 subgroups jointly stratified by sex (male or female), age group (<1, 1\u20132, 3\u20134, 5\u20139, 10\u201314, 15\u201319, 20\u201324, 25\u201329, 30\u201334, 35\u201339, 40\u201344, 45\u201349, 50\u201354, 55\u201359, 60\u201364, 65\u201369, 70\u201374, 75\u201379, 80\u201384, 85\u201389, 90\u201394 and \u226595\u2009years), education (<6\u2009years, \u22656 to <12\u2009years, or \u226512\u2009years) and urban versus rural residence; within 185 countries covering 99.0% of the world\u2019s population in 201842. Uncertainty of each stratum-specific dietary factor estimate was quantified using 4,000 iterations to determine posterior distributions jointly by country, year, age, sex, education and urbanicity42. We computed the median intake and the 95% UI for each stratum from the 50th, 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the 4,000 draws, respectively42. Validity checks included: five-fold cross-validation (randomly omitting 20% of the raw survey data, run five times), comparing predicted versus observed intakes; assessment of implausible estimates; and visual assessment of national mean intakes using global heat maps42. A second time-component-based Bayesian model was used to strengthen time trend estimates for dietary factors with corresponding food or nutrient availability data (FAO Food Balance Sheets49and Global Expanded Nutrient Supply50)42. The model, commonly referred to as a varying slopes model, incorporated country-level intercepts, and slopes, along with their correlation that is estimated across countries42,51,52. The final GDD results were based on these two Bayesian models42, as detailed inSupplementary Information.\nFor our primary analysis, we focused on the AHEI. For each stratum, we scored nine components: fruit, non-starchy vegetables, whole grains, SSBs, legumes\/nuts, unprocessed red\/processed meats, seafood omega-3 fat, PUFAs and sodium (alcohol andtransfat were not estimated in GDD) (Supplementary Table6). Each component was scored from 0 to 10, and the final score ranging from 0 to 90 was scaled to range from 0 to 100. DASH was calculated on the basis of eight components, scored from 1 to 5 using sex-specific quintiles, with the final score ranging from 8 to 40 (Supplementary Table7). MED was calculated on the basis of eight components (alcohol was not estimated), with each component scored as 0 or 1 using sex-specific medians and the final score ranging from 0 to 8 (Supplementary Table8). As scoring cutpoints for DASH and MED are based on observed population distributions, distributions were calculated for 2018 and used consistently in other years. As each of these scores is based on usual adult intakes, consumption levels of dietary factors in each stratum were standardized to 2,000\u2009kcal per day for deriving the dietary pattern scores. For each dietary pattern, higher scores are given for higher intakes of healthier foods or nutrients and lower intakes of unhealthier foods or nutrients, and thus higher scores represent healthier diets.\nPopulation-weighted average dietary pattern scores for each population subgroup stratum in each country\u2013year were calculated using all 4,000 posterior predictions for each of the components in that stratum to derive global, regional and national scores42. Annual population weights were derived from the United Nations Population Division53, supplemented with data on educational and urban\/rural distributions from Barro Lee54and the United Nations55, respectively42. Spearman correlations assessed inter-relationships between each dietary pattern score. Changes in scores between 1990 and 2018 were calculated using all 4,000 posterior predictions for each stratum to account for the full spectrum of uncertainty and standardized to the proportion of individuals within each stratum in 2018 to account for changes in demographics over time42. Given the Bayesian nature of the analysis, formal statistical significance was not appropriate, and the 95% UIs should be used as a guide42.\nThe modelled estimates of individual food and nutrient intakes by population subgroup, country, region and globe in 1990 and 2018 are available for download from the GDD (https:\/\/www.globaldietarydatabase.org\/).

Increasing the use of food system by-products and residues as feed could reduce this competition. We gathered data on global food system material flows for crop, livestock and aquaculture production, focusing on feed use and the availability of by-products and residues. We then analysed the potential of replacing food-competing feedstuff\u2014here cereals, whole fish, vegetable oils and pulses that account for 15% of total feed use\u2014with food system by-products and residues. Considering the nutritional requirements of food-producing animals, including farmed aquatic species, this replacement could increase the current global food supply by up to 13% (10\u201316%) in terms of kcal and 15% (12\u201319%) in terms of protein content. Increasing the use of food system by-products as feed has considerable potential, particularly when combined with other measures, in the much-needed transition towards circular food systems.\nThe current structure of the global food system results in suboptimal food availability, as a large proportion of the resources used in livestock and aquaculture feeds could be consumed by humans. Up to 40% of all arable land and more than 30% of cereal crop production is used for animal feeds1,2, and approximately 23% of all captured fish are destined for non-food uses, mainly for fish and livestock feeds3. This food\u2013feed competition reduces the efficiency of the existing food system, as environmental and resource costs are higher when arable land is used for animal feed production instead of directly contributing to human consumption4,5,6.\nIncreasing the feed use of food system by-products\u2014that is, the secondary products created alongside the primary, human-consumable products\u2014has been proposed as a solution to increase resource use efficiency7,8,9,10, to reduce food\u2013feed competition11and to increase food system circularity10,12,13. In addition, using food system by-products as feeds can reduce the environmental pressure on arable land and freshwater ecosystems, as well as reduce greenhouse gas emissions and fertilizer application8,10,13,14,15,16. Increasing the use of by-products and crop residues as feed can also be cost-effective since many of them are widely available, low-cost materials17. However, some non-food-competing feedstuffs are less suitable for feed use; for example, crop residues are fibrous and of low digestibility and poor protein quality, and others, such as some crop processing by-products, are protein dense but low on energy10. Yet, some non-food-competing feedstuffs can be improved through processing or additives18. Despite the challenges, part of the food-competing feed use could be replaced with non-food-competing feedstuffs without negatively impacting productivity19,20(Supplementary Tables7and8).\nIn this study, we assess the potential of improving circularity in the global food system by increasing the use of food system by-products and residues in animal feeds. This approach provides a much-needed systemic view of the highly interlinked global food system and advances the research field on three main fronts. First, global datasets including both feed material flows and the availability of food system by-products and residues at this level of detail do not exist. While different models and reports provide data on livestock21,22,23or aquaculture feed use24,25, these data are not harmonized throughout the global food system. Furthermore, while some studies have estimated feed use in both agriculture and aquaculture systems, they do not account for country-level differences in feed use26or have only regional focus27. Here we combined and harmonized data from various sources including crop, livestock and aquaculture production, as well as wild fisheries, and quantified the dynamics of global feed flows in remarkable detail (Fig.1andMethods).\nFour main phases were considered in the analysis: (1) quantification of global food system material flows\u2014we quantified global food system material flows including the potential production of by-products and the feed use in both terrestrial and aquatic food systems; (2) availability of by-products\u2014we analysed the availability of the by-products by subtracting their current feed use from potential production, assuming that all non-used by-products would be available for feed; (3) nutritional limitations\u2014using existing literature, we considered to what extent by-products can replace food-competing feedstuff in animal feeds, accounting for impacts on productivity; and (4) replacement potential\u2014we estimated the amount of food-competing feedstuff that could be replaced with non-food-competing feedstuff. SeeMethodsfor the quantitative interpretation of the flows as well as the data used for each phase.\nSecond, material flows related to food system by-products have been estimated and reported only sporadically10,15,17,22,28; thus, a comprehensive understanding of those flows is lacking. We overcame this by analysing the availability of different by-products and residues followed by quantifying their current feed use and the potential availability to further increase their feed use. Third, existing studies have assessed the feed use potential of individual by-products within specific production systems (Supplementary Tables7and8) and have analysed scenarios of livestock production that could be sustained by restricting their feed use to non-food-competing feedstuffs8,9,10,11,29. On the basis of our quantification of global food system material flows, we extend this knowledge by assessing the replacement potential of food-competing feedstuff with by-products and residues while simultaneously considering their regional availability and nutritional constraints in both the aquaculture and livestock production sectors (Methods). The nutritional constraints that dictate the replacement potential are based on an extensive literature review of feed experiment studies (Supplementary Tables7and8). Combining the three advances, we are able to show that increased utilization of food system by-products and residues in animal feeds could theoretically lead to a considerable upsurge in the global food supply.\nWe first combined data from various sources, using production data for primary products for 2016\u20132018 (refs.2,30) and feed composition data for livestock and aquaculture for 2010 (refs.21,31) to analyse the current feed flows (Fig.1andMethods). We focused on the feed use of food-competing feedstuff including cereals, oilseed oils, pulses and whole fish used in fishmeal and fish oil production (Supplementary Table3; seeMethodsfor assumptions).\nApproximately 15% (940 million tons in dry matter) of the total feedstuffs (6,100 million tons) used in livestock and aquaculture production consisted of food-competing feedstuff that could be directly used as human food (Fig.2). This is in line with existing estimates1,23(Supplementary Information). However, animal production systems differ substantially in their food-competing feedstuff use21,31,32. At the global level, up to 49% of feed use in aquaculture (total feed use, 67 million tons), 68% in poultry (total 421 million tons) and 38% in pork meat production (total 1,200 million tons) consisted of food-competing feedstuff, while for cattle meat (total 5,200 million tons) and dairy (total 1,920 million tons), the share was only 3\u20134% (in quantities of feed in dry matter). The low share of food-competing feedstuff in cattle feed is mainly due to the large share of global cattle production being extensive grazing systems, which have high feed conversion ratios (kg feed per kg output), consuming high amounts of feed consisting mainly of roughages such as grass and hay. Diets in industrial feedlot cattle systems often include a higher share of food-competing feedstuff. For example, in some North American and European industrial beef cattle systems, the diets in the finishing phase can consist of more than 70% (ref.21) food-competing feedstuff. However, these systems are highly optimized, having lower feed conversion ratios33and consequently lower total feed consumption. Furthermore, we found that regional variation in food-competing feedstuff use is notable, the minimum being less than 4% in Africa and values ranging through 7% in Oceania, 8% in Latin America, 15% in Europe and 16% in Asia to a maximum of almost 20% in North America. These differences reflect regional variations both in animal species farmed (that is, the relative proportions of different animals) and in production mode (that is, intensive versus extensive systems).\na, All feed flows.b, Flows for only food-competing feedstuff. The percentages refer to the shares of the feed use categories (on the left) and the shares of the feed use in specific animal production groups (on the right) of the total global feed use. The feedstuffs included in each category are described in Supplementary Tables3and4. The data sources used are given inMethods. Material flows in terms of protein content are shown in Extended Data Fig.1.\nAt the global level, however, most of the feed use consists of materials not suitable for human consumption, mainly roughages such as grass foraged by cattle (Fig.2a). Cereals form by far the largest group of food-competing feedstuff use, in which maize is the most important feed cereal, followed by wheat, rice and barley (Figs.2band3a,d). Notably, fish products (fishmeal and fish oil) are important sources of protein (Fig.3band Extended Data Fig.1) and fat (Fig.3c) when examining the global feed protein and fat flows. They can also be important for the supply of healthy fatty acids (EPA and DHA). Similarly, the importance of oilseed oils increases when looking at the fat content (Fig.3c).\na\u2013d, The values represent averages over 2016\u20132018 for energy content (kcal) (a), protein content (b), fat content (c) and quantities (dry matter weight) (d). The error bars represent the total uncertainty range for different feedstuffs (Methods). The use of the feed is colour-coded to each feed group.\nIn this study, we identified four main categories of food system by-products: (1) crop residues (that is, the plant material remaining after harvesting, including parts such as straw, leaves, stalks, roots and stover); (2) crop processing by-products, including cereal bran and distiller\u2019s grains (including distiller\u2019s grains from biofuel and brewer\u2019s grains from barley beer industries), sugar by-products (including sugarcane and sugar beet molasses and sugar beet pulp), oilseed meals (including rapeseed, soybean, sunflower seed, palm kernel, sesame seed, cottonseed, groundnut and other oilseed meals) and citrus pulp; (3) livestock by-products from non-ruminant origins (that is, processed animal protein from pig and poultry production, here blood meal, hydrolysed feather meal, meat and bone meal, poultry by-product meal, and poultry oil); and (4) fisheries and aquaculture processing by-products, hereafter referred to as fish by-products, processed into fishmeal and fish oil. The total availability of food system by-products was estimated by multiplying the production quantities of primary products2,33by conversion factors for different by-products and residues10,33, or applying global statistics2or other literature (Methods). The feed use of these by-products and residues was then subtracted from their total availability to estimate the potential availability of materials not already used as feed.\nOnly relatively small shares of crop residues and livestock by-products are currently used as feed, while nearly all oilseed meals (that is, oilseed meals and cakes, here grouped together under meals) and more than half of the total potential of crop processing by-products, such as sugar beet pulp and cereal bran, are already used as feeds (Fig.4). It should be noted that while only a small share of crop residues are used for feed, these resources also have other uses such as biofuels or bedding material for livestock (Discussion). Here the use of crop residues in maintaining soil quality was taken into account in sustainable harvest ratios (Methods), but other uses were excluded, assuming that all by-products not already used for feed would be available to replace the human-edible feeds in animal diets. Despite their multiple uses, the highest theoretical potential in utilizing by-products as feed still lies in crop residues, as their theoretical availability exceeds the availability of other by-products (Fig.5).\nThe increased feed use of by-products when applying the replacement potential analysed in this study. Uncertainty range for current feed use (left), additional feed use when replacement is applied (middle) and other uses\/theoretical availability (right) is shown. Negative values refer to the feed use exceeding potential availability. For the individual products included in the combined categories, see Supplementary Table4.\na, Crop residues include residues from rice, cereals, sugar cane and pulses.b, Sugar processing by-products include molasses from sugar beet and sugar cane, as well as sugar beet pulp.c, Citrus pulp includes the by-products from citrus juice processing.d, Distiller\u2019s grains include the by-products from corn ethanol production and barley beer brewing.e, Cereal bran includes bran of barley, buckwheat, maize, millet, oats, pulses, rice, rye, sorghum, wheat, fonio, triticale and other cereals.f, Oilseed meals include rapeseed, soybean, sunflower seed, palm kernel, sesame seed, cottonseed, groundnut and other oilseed meals.g, Livestock by-products include by-products of non-ruminant origin, including blood meal, hydrolysed feather meal, meat meal, poultry by-product meal and poultry oil.h, Fishmeal from fish by-products includes by-products from processing of both aquaculture and capture fish. The values were computed by subtracting the current global feed use from potential by-product production and then rescaling the available by-products on the basis of each country\u2019s share of global production.\nThe availability of crop residues and livestock by-products is directly related to the volume of crop and livestock production in a country; hence, countries with higher agricultural production show the highest potential availability (Fig.5a,g). For crop processing by-products, such as cereal bran, which have higher variation in their production and higher feed use, South Asia, Russia and North America show high availability (Fig.5e), while for sugar processing by-products, Brazil and India show particular potential for increased feed use (Fig.5b). Brazil is also the largest producer of citrus pulp (Fig.5c). The United States, China and Brazil are the largest producers of distiller\u2019s grains from both biofuel production and beer brewing, showing also the highest availability (Fig.5d). Oilseed meals are highly valued feed materials, which shows in nearly all oilseed meals being used as feed at the global level (Fig.5f). For fishmeal from fish by-products, countries with the most fisheries and aquaculture production (such as China and Indonesia) show the highest availability and the largest potential to increase the production of fishmeal and fish oil from fish by-products, either for local needs or for export to other countries (Fig.5h).\nOnce we had estimated the current food system\u2019s feed flows and the availability of by-products, we were able to assess the potential of replacing food-competing feedstuff with by-products, including both the livestock and aquaculture sectors. Animal-specific nutritional requirements and regulations regarding the feed use of animal by-products were considered in the replacement potential (Methods). The regional availability of by-products was also considered, assuming that all by-products that are not currently used as feed were utilizable in animal production (MethodsandDiscussion). For a detailed analysis, we selected by-products that are currently used as feed but that also have a large potential to increase their feed use at the global level. Hence, we focused on the potential to replace food-competing feeds (that is, cereals, oilseed oils, pulses, fishmeal from whole fish and fish oil from whole fish) with by-products having similar nutritional profiles (Table1).\nAlthough the potential availability of some by-products or residues is much higher than their current feed use (Fig.4), animal-specific nutritional requirements constrain their use in diets of livestock and aquaculture (Supplementary Table6). For example, although crop residues are abundant, their fibrousness and lack of protein and readily utilizable carbohydrates limit their inclusion potential in diets that maintain animal productivity (Supplementary Table8). The same applies for some other feedstuffs: for example, livestock by-products could replace all fish use, but to maintain the essential fatty acid profile required in aquaculture production34, not all fish oil in aquafeeds can be substituted with processed animal fats from livestock (Supplementary Tables6and7).\nHere the replacement potential was estimated on the basis of literature on feed experiments, applying the maximum replacement ratios with no observed impact on productivity (Methods). The only exception was considered for the replacement of cereals with crop residues in cattle production, as negative impacts on productivity are probably unavoidable even with low substitution rates (Supplementary Tables6and8). Therefore, for feed cereal use, two cases were analysed: first, without the inclusion of crop residues in the replacement, and second, including also crop residues and taking the consequent reduction in cattle productivity into account (Table1).\nWhen considering the replacement constraints (Supplementary Table6) and the total availability of the selected by-products, up to 11\u201312% of the food-competing feedstuff could be globally replaced with the selected by-products without negatively impacting animal productivity. The replacement share could be as high as 25\u201329% when also considering the replacement of cereals with crop residues and consequently allowing some decrease in animal productivity (Table1). The highest total feed replacement potential lies in cereals, as these are integral feedstuffs in all animal production systems (Fig.2). However, the share of potential replacement is the highest for fishmeal and fish oil made from whole fish, indicating that nearly all whole fish used to produce fishmeal and fish oil could be replaced with by-products (Table1).\nApplying the maximum replacement potential of food-competing feedstuff with by-products could free up altogether 430\u2013650\u2009\u00d7\u20091012kcal and 17\u201326 million tons of protein for humans, corresponding to 5\u20137% and 7\u201311% of the current global food supply, respectively. The current global food supply refers to the average food supply for the global population in 2016\u20132018 (ref.2), taking into account food losses and waste from the supply chain, excluding the production and consumption stages35. More specifically, up to 72\u2013103 million tons of cereals (almost 10% of their feed use), up to 3.8\u20136.0 million tons of vegetable oils from oilseeds (~31\u201342% of their feed use), 8\u201319 million tons of pulses (~50\u201388% of their feed use) and 2.9\u20133.9 million tons of fishmeal made from whole fish, corresponding to more than 17 million tons of whole fish (~11% of the current seafood supply) could be directed to human food use. When also considering crop residues as potential replacement materials, up to 25\u201328% of cereal feed use could be replaced; but this would impact animal productivity, which should be balanced and assessed carefully (Table1). When applying world average yields for the replaced feed crop groups, the replacement would free up to 31\u201354 million ha of cropland. If also considering crop residues as replacement materials, the replacement would free more than 100 million ha of cropland, corresponding to 7% of the world total arable land use in 2018 (ref.2).\nIn the maximum replacement potential scenario, the majority of the available cereal and sugar processing by-products are utilized as feeds. In contrast, fishmeal from fish by-products, livestock by-products and crop residues remain largely unutilized, and the majority of their biomass would still be available for other uses than feed, such as energy use (Fig.4).\nWe have demonstrated the considerable potential of increasing the feed use of food system by-products in the current food system. Our analysis extends and complements existing scenario-based assessments, which have found that it is possible to keep the global food supply adequate by restricting livestock feed use to only non-food-competing feedstuffs, combined with changes in livestock production levels and thus diet changes8,9,10,11,29. By quantifying the potential to reduce the feed use of food-competing feedstuffs across the current global food system, we were able to estimate how to increase the global food supply without consuming additional natural resources (Table1).\nWe found that reducing the feed use of cereals presents the highest potential for increasing the global food supply. However, the increased supply of whole fish, pulses and oilseed oils can also contribute substantially to human nutrition, especially in terms of protein and fat (Fig.3). Notably, we also showed that these potentials vary across the globe (Fig.5). Global trade can increase the availability of food system by-products\u2014and therefore the replacement potential\u2014in some regions, but in this analysis, only intra-region trade was allowed. The replacement potential of food-grade feed use could be further increased by also considering food waste10and former foods\u2014that is, foodstuff manufactured for human consumption but not consumed by humans for practical or logistical reasons36,37,38,39. Post-consumer food waste can be safe and nutritious for pigs when treated properly40, and pre-consumer, plant-based food waste can also be fed to ruminants41. Replacing food-competing feedstuff with food waste could save up to 8.8 million tons of human-edible grains in the European Union42, in addition to our estimates of 14.7\u201318.6 million tons on the replacement potential of cereals with by-products and crop residues in Europe. Moreover, food system by-products not yet considered in this study (such as by-products from dairy or bakery industries) have shown considerable feedstuff potential in case studies with little or no reductions in productivity38. Their replacement potential should therefore be incorporated and assessed in future global studies. Further research is warranted on the replacement potential of food-competing feedstuffs with different by-products and residues in animal nutrition.\nDespite the high potential, the prospects of replacing part of food-competing feedstuffs with food system by-products and residues are faced by various challenges. For example, the production of alternative feeds can be limited by the availability of by-products and residues or by existing regulations, such as bans on intra-species feed recycling in farmed animal production in the European Union43,44,45. Nutritional aspects can also limit the potential. Some by-products are of lower nutritional quality and can contain antinutritive compounds or high amounts of fibre that can lead to decreased animal production, especially in monogastric animals46,47. This is particularly the case with crop residues, which show the highest potential availability (Fig.4). Replacing high-quality feeds with alternative biomass materials could result in lower livestock and aquaculture productivity or reduced nutritional content (for example, fatty acid composition) of the commodities produced48,49. Raising livestock or fish species that can consume lower-quality feeds (such as crop residues) can increase the feed use potential of these by-products and residues10,50. If the use of lower-quality feeds is considered beneficial from a larger circular systems perspective\u2014for example, supported by policy incentives\u2014reductions in productivity could be acceptable to producers. Furthermore, processing by-products through, for example, fermentation or other chemical treatments or additives can improve their nutritional value18,51,52,53. Yet, as shown in the different feed experiment studies reviewed here (Supplementary Tables7and8), crop processing and animal by-products are of particularly valuable nutritional quality, and they can replace food-grade feed use while maintaining productivity (Supplementary Table8)37,39. Especially in cattle nutrition, it is possible to formulate diets entirely based on non-food-competing feedstuffs even at very high animal production levels20. Furthermore, many by-products (especially those generated in livestock and fish processing) have high water content and are highly perishable, or their production is seasonal (as is also the case with crop residues). Hence, they require proper infrastructure and know-how for stabilization, collecting, transportation, storage and processing47, which are currently not in place.\nWhen increasing the feed use of food system by-products and residues, it is important to consider the impact of reduced raw materials available for other competitive uses, such as bioenergy, pharmaceuticals and fertilizer production. Yet, even when applying the maximum replacement potential shown in this study, much of crop residues and fish and livestock by-products would remain available for other uses (Fig.3). The issue of competitive uses is therefore more critical for other by-product groups, such as crop processing by-products. It can be argued, however, that food production should be prioritized over other uses of these biomass flows, as the other uses can typically utilize multiple alternative materials, whereas food can be produced only within food systems13,54. Furthermore, if aiming to totally decouple animal production from arable land use and consequently limit the production of by-products only to food production, the availability of feed-use-driven by-products such as soybean meals would be considerably lower. The complexity in utilizing food system by-products highlights that a broad systems perspective is required55, complemented by further research to fully understand the replacement potential, practical challenges and trade-offs related to realizing this potential.\nIncreasing the human consumption of food-grade feedstuff also presents challenges. First, not all feed cereals meet the food quality standards set by manufacturers or government agencies, and changing from feed crop production to food crop production might require additional inputs, such as increased fertilization. Second, consumer preferences such as cultural and taste aspects need to be considered. For example, whole fish used in fishmeal and fish oil industries (that is, forage fish) consists mainly of bony and small pelagic fish species, other low-value by-catch fish or juvenile individuals. These are often not preferred for direct human consumption, and they might require processing and preserving (for example, in canned, cured or dried form) for wider acceptance and uses in human diets56. However, these small fish are often low-cost and highly nutritious, and they can serve as valuable dietary additions, especially in regions where more expensive fish products are not accessible for many people57.\nThe data in this study were gathered from various sources, databases, reports and models, each of which contain limitations of their own. An uncertainty analysis was performed for the estimation of livestock and aquaculture feed use, as well as for the potential availability of different by-products (Methods). Despite the uncertainties involved, our estimates for livestock and aquaculture feed use and the availability of by-products are in accordance with previous studies (see the comparison in theSupplementary Information). While our study provides preliminary quantifications, a wider range of by-products and their replacement potential should be assessed in future studies, also including a more comprehensive trade model. Specifically, some food-competing feedstuff categories excluded in this study, such as roots and tubers, might present additional replacement opportunities. Moreover, estimating the replacement potential constraints in animal nutrition is challenging since animal nutritional needs differ in different growth stages and production levels. The estimates used in this study were based on feed experiment studies that consider each replacement material individually (Methods). In practice, animal diets would probably be designed to include several different replacement materials simultaneously (for example, brans, sugar beet pulp and oilseed meals). Their combined effect would, however, need more careful consideration, as it could affect the nutritional value and palatability of the final product or animal health. On the basis of these limitations, our results should be considered as the theoretical potential of a biophysical change. These findings should be combined with more local-level studies on the practical replacement potential, which also accounts for social and economic factors.\nMore efficient use of food system by-products and residues can reduce food\u2013feed competition and increase the global food supply without increasing the use of valuable natural resources. This, in combination with other measures, is an urgently needed action in the transition towards more sustainable and circular food systems, which are prominent objectives in many national and European Union\u2013level strategies58,59. However, harnessing the untapped potential of food system by-products and residues would require a paradigm shift that puts more value on the efficient use of materials and the capacity of the livestock and aquaculture sectors to circulate non-food-grade biomass back to food systems through feed use. Policy interventions and regulation would be needed in managing the feed resources and to provide incentives for feed industries to develop and innovate solutions for increased use of the materials least used as feed, as highlighted by this study.\nThe material flows of feed use and the production of by-products and residues in the global food system were mapped to understand the links and dependencies between the three subsectors of crop, livestock and aquaculture production. The analysis consisted of four main steps (Fig.1). First, we quantified the global food system flows, including the national levels of feed use in both the livestock and aquaculture sectors and the potential production of by-products. Second, the regional availability of by-products and residues was analysed by subtracting the quantities used as feed from the potential production. Third, using existing literature on feed experiments, we considered how much of the food-competing feedstuff can be replaced with food system by-products, considering the nutritional requirements of the production animals as well as regulations. Fourth, the replacement potential was analysed, combining the regional availability of the by-products and residues with the nutritional requirements. Finally, the potential increase in the global food supply was calculated, assuming that all feedstuffs freed by this replacement were redirected to human consumption. The analysis was performed for a three-year average of 2016\u20132018.\nHere the focus was on replacing human-edible feed use, including cereals, oilseed oils, pulses, sugar crops and whole fish used in producing fish oil and fishmeal, with by-products and residues. Although some of the feedstuffs in these categories are produced with varieties classified as not suitable for human food (for example, fodder maize), and not all of them meet the quality criteria for food use, we allocated them to the food-competing feedstuff category since they are produced on arable land that can instead be used for the production of varieties suitable for human consumption. Also, other forage feeds (for example, alfalfa or grass hay) may compete with food production when produced on arable land, but unlike fodder maize, they are less demanding and are often produced in marginal lands60,61; therefore, they were not treated as food-competing feedstuff in this study. All feed use of oilseeds was converted into meals\/cakes and oils. While some unprocessed oilseeds (for example, soybeans) are consumed by humans, here only the oil fraction was considered human edible. The economic importance of different oilseed meals varies greatly, and especially with soybean, the meal fraction constitutes a major part of the production value. Here we still aggregate all oilseed meals as by-products from the food system perspective, as they are fractions of food crops but require the animal sector to return to the human food supply. Roughages, crop residues and crop processing by-products (such as oilseed meals and cereal bran) were not considered food-competing (Supplementary Table4). Although some of them (for example, brans) can also be used as food, they are considered co-products of primary food commodities (for example, flour); therefore, they were not considered to be in direct competition with food use.\nFor the total feed use in livestock production, we first multiplied the yearly national cattle (meat and dairy), poultry (meat and eggs) and pork (meat) production from the statistics from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)2by the ratios of different production systems from FAO GLEAM21. The production numbers were multiplied by the regional feed conversion ratios (FCRs) (kg dry matter feed per kg output), combining the FCRs from three global studies: Mekonnen and Hoekstra62(all commodities), Mottet et al.1(all commodities) and Herrero et al.23(only for cattle). The FCR values reported as dry matter feed use per protein content were converted into dry matter feed use per product by applying data on protein content of the different end products from ref.63. These sources, although being the most up-to-date ones covering all world regions, are limited and include uncertainties (for example, due to the lack of data). In this study, the FCRs for the years 2000 (refs.23,62) and 2010 (ref.1) were applied. It is very likely that the FCRs have improved since, with more efficient production systems. At the same time, the development of livestock FCRs in the past decade has been rather minor; for example, the FCRs for finishing pigs in the European Union improved by only 1% between 2013 and 2019 (refs.64,65). Nevertheless, updated and more precise FCRs, particularly for low-income countries\u2014where the development might be faster and collecting data can be challenging\u2014could yield somewhat different results. There is therefore a need for studies that work with the uncertainties related to the data applied and address potential changes in feed use material flows owing to production systems\u2019 development. The country- and species-specific feed use was multiplied by the ratio of different feedstuffs from ref.21. These feed use data are presented for different production systems for ten world regions, including the feed use of both non-food-competing feedstuff (such as roughages and by-products) and the feed use of food-competing feedstuff (such as cereals and other food crops) for the different livestock species. This procedure resulted in higher estimates of total fishmeal use in poultry and pig production compared with the official data reported in ref.66and was thus corrected by applying the fishmeal inclusion rates for pig and poultry from ref.26. In addition, the aggregated feed use category of grains in ruminant feed was divided into individual commodities (maize, wheat and barley) on the basis of global feed use ratios of these materials.\nFor the total feed use in aquaculture, for both commercial and farm-made feeds, we multiplied the production of each fed aquaculture production group (carps, tilapias, catfishes, other freshwater fishes, salmons, trouts, milkfish, eels, other marine fishes, shrimps and other freshwater crustaceans) by their respective FCRs. The FCRs for commercial feeds were derived from ref.25, and the FCRs for farm-made feeds were assumed to be 50% higher than those for commercial ones on the basis of ref.67. Diet compositions for the major fed aquaculture groups were taken from country-specific survey data from ref.31and extrapolated to country-level diets according to ref.32. The diet composition data were provided in ranges of inclusion for each ingredient (minimum, maximum and average), and to estimate a diet composition that sums to 100%, the proportion of each ingredient for the average diet composition was used to scale the diet to it, as explained in more detail in theSupplementary Information. The amounts of fishmeal and fish oil produced from by-products of fish processing were estimated to be 25\u201335% of the total quantities produced3.\nThe livestock and aquaculture feed data were combined, the different feed categories were unified and the totals were validated and harmonized with the estimates of global feed use from FAO Supply and Utilization Accounts2for the years 2016\u20132018 for the feed groups for which the data were available (cereals, pulses, vegetable oils and molasses). Comparisons between our feed use estimates and published data are available in theSupplementary Information.\nTo estimate the availability of food system by-products and residues, we first estimated their global production and subtracted current feed use from the totals. We then assigned the available by-products to countries on the basis of their share of global production of each feedstuff. Four categories of food system by-products were considered: (1) crop residues; (2) cereal, sugar, citrus fruit and oilseed processing by-products; (3) livestock by-products; and (4) fish by-products processed into fishmeal and fish oil. The focus was on the by-products of primary crop and animal production and crop processing by-products already used as feed in important quantities at the global scale; therefore, food waste from retail or consumption, for example, was not considered here.\nTo estimate the potential availability of crop residues, the yearly crop production2was multiplied by crop-specific residues-to-production ratios from ref.68and S. Wirsenius et al. (manuscript in preparation). Here we considered only crop residues from cereals, rice, sugar cane and pulses that are most used as feedstuff17,69. Crop residues left on fields have an important impact on soil fertilization and moisture retention28. We therefore accounted for the crop residues that will be left on fields by multiplying the crop production by the ratios of maximum sustainable harvest, ranging from 0% to 50% (refs.28,70).\nCrop processing by-products are the co-products that result from a multifunctional process that is driven by the demand of the main product. The by-products considered in this study included cereal bran, distiller\u2019s grains from biofuel and brewing industries, sugar beet pulp, sugarcane and sugar beet molasses, citrus pulp, and oilseed meals. The average quantities of cereal bran and molasses produced between 2016 and 2018 were adopted from FAO Supply and Utilization Accounts2. The amounts of distiller\u2019s grains from corn ethanol production were applied from ref.71for the four highest-production countries, covering 97% of the global corn ethanol production. Brewer\u2019s grains from beer brewing were estimated assuming that 21\u201322\u2009kg of spent grains are produced per hectolitre of brewed beer72and multiplying the country-level barley beer production2by this conversion factor. The amounts of sugar beet pulp and oilseed meals were calculated from the average amounts of sugar beet and oilseeds processed between 2016 and 2018 (ref.2) and multiplied by the conversion factors73reducing the amounts of waste created in the processing stage74. The production of citrus pulp was estimated by multiplying the amounts of citrus fruits (lemons and limes, oranges, tangerines, mandarins, clementines and satsumas) processed21by the conversion factor73and subtracting waste and losses from processing74.\nTo estimate the potential availability of livestock by-products, we first converted the production quantities of end products (cattle, pig and poultry meat)2to live weight using dressing percentages21and then multiplied those by the ratios of the processed by-products (poultry by-product meal, poultry oil, blood meal, hydrolysed feather meal, meat meal from pork meat production and poultry oil)33. To estimate the poultry by-products from egg production, the amounts of slaughtered hen were calculated. This was estimated by dividing the numbers of laying hens2by the average age at slaughtering and multiplying by their average weight at the end of the laying period21. Here the meat from laying hens was not assumed to be consumed by humans.\nTo estimate the availability of by-products from fish production, we first gathered the aquaculture production and capture fisheries data from FishStatJ30. The fisheries production was multiplied by the average ratios of human consumption and non-food use from refs.75,76, which presented the average ratios for developed and developing countries separately. The data were corrected for certain captured fish species for which the literature indicates a higher ratio going to non-food use77,78. The amounts of fish destined for non-food uses were then multiplied by the ratios going to reduction (that is, fishmeal and fish oil production) and the ratios of fish fed directly to aquaculture75,76. The amounts of potential fish by-products were estimated by multiplying the amounts of fish for human consumption from capture fisheries and aquaculture by the ratios processed75,76and multiplying the processed quantities by the average ratio of 41.5% of fish consisting of by-products (such as trimmings)79, subtracting 2% blood that is not used in reduction and finally assuming 2% losses at the primary fish processing stage78. The share of by-products in fish varies among different fish species and even among the same species. The value applied in this study (41.5%) was estimated for salmon79and is probably a conservative estimate for most other fish species. However, it was applied here as a proxy, to avoid an overly optimistic estimation of fish by-product availability. To account for the uncertainty inherent in applying these conversion factors, we performed a sensitivity analysis (see below). The amounts of fishmeal and fish oil that could be produced from these by-products were then estimated by using the conversion ratios of 0.2 for fishmeal and 0.04 for fish oil, values a bit lower than the conversion ratios for fishmeal and fish oil from whole fish77. Comparisons between our estimates and assessments from previous studies of food system by-product availability are available in theSupplementary Information. The production of by-products was converted to dry matter using the dry matter contents of the different feedstuffs22,80,81.\nThe replacement constraints estimating the share of by-products that can replace food-competing feedstuff in animal feed were derived from feed experiment studies, assuming no reductions in productivity. The only exception for this was the replacement of cereals with crop residues in cattle feeds, which reduced productivity by 40\u201380%. This reduced productivity was taken into account later when estimating the increased food supply.\nFishmeal and fish oil are included in livestock feeds and aquafeeds because of their protein content, favourable amino acid and fatty acid profiles, effects on growth and the immune system, and high digestibility82. However, they are not essential to pig and poultry, and here we assumed that 75\u2013100% of the fishmeal in pig and poultry feeds is replaceable with oilseed meals, fishmeal made from fish by-products or livestock by-products of non-ruminant origin (blood meal and hydrolysed feather meal) without negatively impacting their productivity83,84(Supplementary Table7).\nOn the basis of previous alternative feed experiments for various fish species, 27\u201379% of the fishmeal (dry matter) and 51\u201379% of the fish oil in aquafeeds can be replaced with processed by-products from livestock production (Supplementary Table7). Fishmeal and fish oil made from fish by-products differ from those produced from whole fish as they on average contain less protein and have a higher ash content85. Despite this, they provide essential fatty acids and have been successfully applied in aquafeeds85. Here we assume that they are viable alternatives and can replace 75\u2013100% of the fishmeal and fish oil made from whole fish in aquafeeds. Distiller\u2019s grains have also been applied in aquafeeds, but they require further processing to remove fibre and increase their protein content to be viable alternatives for fishmeal86; therefore, they were not included as fishmeal replacement for fish feed in this study.\nCrop processing by-products, including cereal by-products (brans and distiller\u2019s grains), citrus pulp and sugar by-products (sugar beet pulp and molasses), were considered here as potential replacements for cereal use, and oilseed meals as potential replacements for pulse use in livestock feed. Cereal by-products such as bran have been applied in pig feeding (Supplementary Table8). They typically contain less starch and more fibre than whole cereals, due to endosperm removal during processing87. Although the high fibre content of these feedstuffs can produce satiety and have beneficial impacts on gut health in pig production, their inclusion is sometimes limited because of the reduced digestibility of dietary energy and protein, which can reduce the overall production performance88, including also environmental performance (e.g. waste and overall greenhouse gas emissions). Sugar beet pulp contains readily digestible fibre such as pectin, has a low lignin concentration and thus has a high energy value for ruminant nutrition89, making it a well-suited substitute for cereals20. The nutritive value of sugar beet pulp can be further improved with added molasses89. Crop residues (straws and leaves) that are high in fibre can replace part of the cereals used in ruminant feeding, but with negative impacts on productivity (Supplementary Tables6and8). They are better suited for replacing conventional roughage, such as grass silage, in ruminant diets. However, the potential use of crop residues for monogastric animals such as pigs and poultry is much lower due to the limited ability of monogastrics to digest feedstuffs with high fibre concentrations and low digestibility90(Supplementary Table6). Oilseed meals and cakes (derived from soy and rapeseed, for example) are high-quality protein feeds with balanced amino acid composition and high nutrient digestibility for livestock80. The animal production responses of oilseed meals and cakes are typically superior or less often equal to those of pulses (for example, faba bean, pea, lupin and lentils) in diets of lactating dairy cows90,91,92, pigs50,93and poultry94,95. The use of oilseed meals and cakes as protein feed in livestock diets is currently the prevailing practice, whereas pulses are considered as the alternative. The substitution rates of pulses with rapeseed meal and cake and soybean meal were 100% on all livestock diets according to our literature review (Supplementary Table8). However, as literature about substitution rates of pulses with other oilseed by-products was lacking, the substitution rate of all oilseed by-products was assumed to be 75\u2013100%, taking into account possible differences in nutritive value. For ruminants, only the mixed and feedlot production systems21that contained cereals in their feed were considered in the replacement, since the ruminant diets in grazing systems are mainly based on forages and typically contain no or only low amounts of cereal-based concentrates.\nLegislation and regulation also constrain the use of livestock by-products as feed. A comprehensive review of animal by-product regulations in all countries was out of scope for this study, so to follow a precautionary approach and avoid overly optimistic by-product availability estimates, we applied the European Union regulations globally, since they can be considered among the strictest ones. Feeding farmed animals on materials originating from the same species is forbidden43,44,45; in addition, the use of processed by-products from bovine animals is banned in livestock or aquaculture feed to avoid the spread of transmittable diseases43,44. The safety issues regarding the feed use of by-products of ruminant origin are also acknowledged in US regulations96as well as the more broad feed use recommendations by the FAO97. Livestock by-products of bovine origin were therefore not considered as feed replacements in this study. However, livestock-derived protein of non-ruminant origin (meat and bone meal, blood meal, hydrolysed feather meal and poultry meal assessed in this study) is allowed for pig, poultry and aquaculture feeds, considering the intra-species recycling ban45.\nThe replacement potential of cereals, fishmeal and fish oil with food system by-products and residues was estimated by considering (1) the potential availability of the replacement materials within the 19 world regions (see Supplementary Table5for the division of countries into subregions) and (2) the replacement constraints including the nutritional requirements of livestock and aquaculture as well as the regulation of the use of different animal-derived by-products and residues in livestock and aquaculture feeds (Supplementary Tables6\u20138). Environmental performance was, however, not considered.\nFirst, the feed use of each of the food-competing feedstuffs selected was multiplied by the replacement constraints to estimate the maximum and minimum replacement potentials for each animal production group and replacement material individually. Second, the maximum and minimum replacement potentials were corrected with the availability of the selected replacement material in the region. Third, the combined replacement potential of the different replacement materials for one animal production group was estimated by summing the individual replacement potentials and normalizing them to avoid exceeding the total feed use of the animal production group in a region. Finally, the combined potential of the different replacement materials and animal production groups were summed to derive the total replacement potential (see Supplementary Section3for a more detailed description of the method).\nThe increased food supply was estimated by multiplying the replaced food-competing feedstuff amounts by their energy (kcal), protein and fat contents63,80,81. Since fishmeal and fish oil can be produced simultaneously from the same fish, the increased food supply from replacing fishmeal and fish oil alternatives was not summed to avoid double-accounting; instead, only the one with the higher replacement potential was considered.\nFor the replacement of cereals in feed use, two cases were estimated: one applying only the replacement materials (cereal bran, sugar beet pulp, molasses, distiller\u2019s grains and citrus pulp) and constraints with no estimated impact on productivity (Supplementary Table6) and a second case adding crop residues as a potential replacement material in addition to the first case. In the latter case, the replacement with crop residues implies a 40\u201380% decrease in cattle meat and dairy production (Supplementary Table6), which was then calculated with a simplified approach assuming that the reduced production would be proportional to the share of feed replaced and subtracted from the estimated increase in the food supply.\nSince the selected by-products are typically low-value commodities, inter-regional trade of by-products and residues was excluded, but materials were assumed to be freely traded within each region. Oilseed meals and fishmeal are exceptions, being highly traded and valued products in the global feed markets. Here, as we did not account for inter-regional trade, the feed use of these highly traded commodities exceeds the potential production for some regions. In those regions, the replacement potential is assumed to be zero for the by-products with negative availability.\nTo assess the combined uncertainties related to the estimation of livestock and aquaculture feed use and the production of food system by-products, we performed Monte Carlo simulations for the input data. First, we searched the literature to find the most suitable ranges for each of the input parameters and variables. We then used these ranges in Monte Carlo simulations (n=\u2009500) to perform an uncertainty analysis.\nFor the analysis, we generated 500 values of potential livestock and aquaculture feed use on the basis of a truncated normal distribution. We used the minimum, maximum and mean values and the standard deviation of the reported FCRs from the literature (described in the \u2018Feed use material flows\u2019 section) to derive the truncated normal distributions for the different production systems and regions.\nNext, we followed a similar approach to derive the uncertainty intervals for the availability of by-products and residues. Five hundred randomly sampled values were taken from uniform distributions of different conversion factors with a coefficient of variation (CV) of 0.1. This CV was chosen because it represents the variation in the FAO technical conversion factors73for many of the crop processing by-products. Due to the lack of more detailed data, the same distribution and CV were assumed to also represent the uncertainty in the availability of crop residues and livestock by-products. Finally, we applied the range for replacement potentials identified in the literature (Supplementary Table6) and generated 500 values of potential replacement constraints on the basis of a uniform distribution to estimate the uncertainty related to the replacement potential (Supplementary Information).\nAll the data used in this study are publicly available; see theSupplementary DataandMethodsfor descriptions of the source data.\nThe analysis was performed using RStudio (R version 4.0.5)98.

Here, we use climate, crop and fishery models to estimate the impacts arising from six scenarios of stratospheric soot injection, predicting the total food calories available in each nation post-war after stored food is consumed. In quantifying impacts away from target areas, we demonstrate that soot injections larger than 5\u2009Tg would lead to mass food shortages, and livestock and aquatic food production would be unable to compensate for reduced crop output, in almost all countries. Adaptation measures such as food waste reduction would have limited impact on increasing available calories. We estimate more than 2\u2009billion people could die from nuclear war between India and Pakistan, and more than 5\u2009billion could die from a war between the United States and Russia\u2014underlining the importance of global cooperation in preventing nuclear war.\nExtraordinary events such as large volcanic eruptions or nuclear war could cause sudden global climate disruptions and affect food security. Global volcanic cooling caused by sulfuric acid aerosols in the stratosphere has resulted in severe famines and political instability, for example, after the 1783 Laki eruption in Iceland1or the 1815 Tambora eruption in Indonesia2,3. For a nuclear war, the global cooling would depend on the yields of the weapons, the number of weapons and the targets, among other atmospheric and geographic factors. In a nuclear war, bombs targeted on cities and industrial areas would start firestorms, injecting large amounts of soot into the upper atmosphere, which would spread globally and rapidly cool the planet4,5,6. Such soot loadings would cause decadal disruptions in Earth\u2019s climate7,8,9, which would impact food production systems on land and in the oceans. In the 1980s, there were investigations of nuclear winter impacts on global agricultural production10and food availability11for 15 nations, but new information now allows us to update those estimates. Several studies have recently analysed changes of major grain crops12,13,14and marine wild catch fisheries15for different scenarios of regional nuclear war using climate, crop and fishery models. A war between India and Pakistan, which recently are accumulating more nuclear weapons with higher yield16, could produce a stratospheric loading of 5\u201347\u2009Tg of soot. A war between the United States, its allies and Russia\u2014who possess more than 90% of the global nuclear arsenal\u2014could produce more than 150\u2009Tg of soot and a nuclear winter4,5,6,7,8,9. While amounts of soot injection into the stratosphere from the use of fewer nuclear weapons would have smaller global impacts17, once a nuclear war starts, it may be very difficult to limit escalation18.\nThe scenarios we studied are listed in Table1. Each scenario assumes a nuclear war lasting one week, resulting in the number and yield of nuclear weapons shown in the table and producing different amounts of soot in the stratosphere. There are many war scenarios that could result in similar amounts of smoke and thus similar climate shocks, including wars involving the other nuclear-armed nations (China, France, United Kingdom, North Korea and Israel).\nRecent catastrophic forest fires in Canada in 201719and Australia in 2019 and 202020,21produced 0.3\u20131\u2009Tg of smoke (0.006\u20130.02\u2009Tg soot), which was subsequently heated by sunlight and lofted high in the stratosphere. The smoke was transported around the world and lasted for many months. This adds confidence to our simulations that predict the same process would occur after nuclear war.\nNuclear war would primarily contaminate soil and water close to where nuclear weapons were used22. Soot disperses globally once it reaches the upper atmosphere; thus, our results are globally relevant regardless of the warring nations. Here, we focus on the climate disruption from nuclear war, which would impact global food production systems on land and in the oceans. So far, an integrated estimate of the impacts of the entire range of war scenarios on both land- and ocean-based food production is missing. We examine the impacts of six war scenarios, generating 5\u2009Tg to 150\u2009Tg of soot, on the food supply (Table1). We use model simulations of major crops and wild-caught marine fish together with estimated changes in other food and livestock production to assess the impacts on global calorie supply.\nUsing climate, crop and fishery models (Methods), we calculate calorie production for different food groups, for each year after a range of six different stratospheric soot injections. The climatic impacts would last for about a decade but would peak in the first few years (Fig.1).\na\u2013f, Changes in surface temperature (a), solar radiation (c) and precipitation (e) averaged over global crop regions of 2000 (Supplementary Fig.1) and sea surface temperature (b), solar radiation (d) and net primary productivity (f) over the oceans following the six stratospheric soot-loading scenarios studied here for 15 years following a nuclear war, derived from simulations in ref.18. These variables are the direct climate forcing for the crop and fishery models. The leftyaxes are the anomalies of monthly climate variables from simulated nuclear war minus the climatology of the control simulation, which is the average of 45 years of simulation. The rightyaxes are the percentage change relative to the control simulation. The wars take place on 15 May of Year 1, and the year labels are on 1 January of each year. For comparison, during the last Ice Age 20,000 years ago, global average surface temperatures were about 5\u2009\u00b0C cooler than present. Ocean temperatures decline less than for crops because of the ocean\u2019s large heat capacity. Ocean solar radiation loss is less than for crops because most ocean is in the Southern Hemisphere, where slightly less smoke is present.\nGlobal average calorie production from the crops we simulated decreased 7% in years 1\u20135 after the war even under the smallest, 5\u2009Tg soot scenario (Fig.2a; comparable to previous multi-model results14, Supplementary Fig.2) and up to 50% under the 47\u2009Tg scenario. In the 150\u2009Tg soot case, global average calorie production from crops would decrease by around 90% 3\u20134 years after the nuclear war. The changes would induce a catastrophic disruption of global food markets, as even a 7% global yield decline compared with the control simulation would exceed the largest anomaly ever recorded since the beginning of Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) observational records in 196114.\na\u2013c, Global average annual crop calorie production changes (%; maize, wheat, rice and soybeans, weighted by their observed production (2010) and calorie content;a), marine fish production changes (%;b) and combined crop and fish calorie production changes (%;c) after nuclear war for the different soot-injection scenarios.d, Grass leaf carbon is a combination of C3 and C4 grasses, and the change is calculated as annual accumulated carbon. For context, the grey line (and shaded area) inaare the average (and standard deviation) of six crop models from the Global Gridded Crop Model Intercomparison (GGCMI, ref.14) under the 5\u2009Tg scenario. CLM5crop shows a conservative response to nuclear war compared with the multi-model GGCMI response.\nFish are another important food resource, especially in terms of protein supply. Nuclear war would reduce the wild fish catch15, but the reduction would be less than for land agriculture (Fig.2b), because reduction in oceanic net primary productivity\u2014the base of the marine food web\u2014is moderate (from 3% in 5\u2009Tg to 37% in 150\u2009Tg), and ocean temperature changes are less pronounced (Fig.1). Terrestrial crop production dominates the total calorie change of crops and fisheries combined (Fig.2c), because global crop production is 24 times higher than wild fisheries in terms of dry matter, and staple crops contain around five times more calories than fish per unit retail mass23,24. In total, marine wild capture fisheries contribute 0.5% of total calories but 3.5% of global average protein supply (Fig.3and Supplementary Fig.3).\na, Global average human diet composition23. Percentages are % of available calories. Veg. is vegetables.b, Global average human protein diet composition23. Marine wild capture contributes 75% of marine fish46. Percentages are % of dry matter production.c, Distribution of four major cereal crops and marine fish between human food and other uses24,47. Percentages are % of dry matter production.d, Usage of crop-based products in 2010 (% of dry matter crop-based production)26. The colour gradient legend in grey incillustrates the usage of different crops and fish in colours. While humans consume most of the wheat and rice grown, most maize and soybeans are used for livestock feed.\nCooling from nuclear wars causes temperature limitations for crops, leading to delayed physiological maturity and additional cold stress14. Calorie reduction from agriculture and marine fisheries shows regional differences (Supplementary Fig.4), with the strongest percentage reductions over high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere. Even for the India\u2013Pakistan case, many regions become unsuitable for agriculture for multiple years. For example, in the 27\u2009Tg case, mid- to high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere show reductions in crop calorie production greater than 50%, along with fish catch reductions of 20\u201330%. The nuclear-armed nations in mid- to high latitude regions (China, Russia, United States, France, North Korea and United Kingdom) show calorie reductions from 30% to 86%, and in lower latitudes (India, Pakistan and Israel), the reduction is less than 10% (Supplementary Tables1and2). Impacts in warring nations are likely to be dominated by local problems, such as infrastructure destruction, radioactive contamination and supply chain disruptions, so the results here apply only to indirect effects from soot injection in remote locations.\nTo estimate the effect on the total food calories available for human consumption, we consider diet composition, calorie content of different food types, crop usage and changes in food production that we did not directly model (Methods). In 2010, FAO23reported that 51% of global calorie availability came from cereals, 31% from vegetables, fruit, roots, tubers and nuts and 18% from animal and related products, of which fish contributed 7%, with marine wild catch contributing 3% (Fig.3a). The crops and fish we simulated provide almost half of these calories and 40% of the protein. Further, only portions of the simulated food production are available for human consumption. Many crops (for example, maize and soybean) are used mainly for non-food uses such as livestock feed (Fig.3c).\nIn addition, the total number of calories available as food is highly dependent on human reactions to nuclear wars. We assume that international trade in food is suspended as food-exporting nations halt exports in response to declining food production (Methods). Furthermore, we considered three societal responses,Livestock, Partial LivestockandNo Livestock(Supplementary Table3). For theLivestockresponse scenario, representing a minimal adaptation to the climate-driven reduction in food production, people continue to maintain livestock and fish as normal. Although harvesting a larger share of crop residues for feed or adding new feed such as insect-based supplements may increase the potential livestock feed, we assume that no new feed supplements are added and the ratio of agricultural grains, residues and grazed biomass to livestock feed is the same. Calories from all crops are reduced by the average reduction in our four simulated crops, and calorie changes from marine wild-caught fish are calculated with business-as-usual fishing behaviour. TheNo Livestockresponse represents a scenario where livestock (including dairy and eggs) and aquaculture production are not maintained after the first year, and the national fractions of crop production previously used as feed are now available to feed humans. In addition, fishing pressure intensifies, simulated through a fivefold increase in fish price15. Similar responses took place in New England in the \u2018year without a summer\u2019 after the 1815 Tambora volcanic eruption2. Even though the temperature changes were smaller than modelled in any of the nuclear war scenarios here, crop failures forced farmers to sell their livestock because they could not feed them3, and previously unpalatable fish were added to their diet2,3,25. We test a full range (0\u2013100%) of the fraction of food-competing feed26that could be used by humans and select 50% as an example in some plots and tables. Between theLivestockandNo Livestockcases, we also consider aPartial Livestockcase, in which the remaining portion of livestock grain feed after converting to human consumption would be used for raising livestock.\nFinal biofuel products (biodiesel and ethanol) only count for 0.5% of the plant-based products27, which could be repurposed as food in the form of plant oil (~1.8% of total food calories) and alcohol (3.4% of total food calories). Byproducts of biofuel have been added to livestock feed and waste27. Therefore, we add only the calories from the final product of biofuel in our calculations. Global averaged household waste is around 20% (ref.28). If we assume that after a nuclear war there would be 50% less or 100% less household waste, these extra calories would become available.\nNational consequences of calorie loss depend on the amount of fallow cropland, regional climate impacts, population levels and assuming a complete halt of international food trade (Methods; Fig.4). Here, we focus on two calorie intake levels in nations: calorie intake to maintain normal physical activity and calorie intake lower than the basal metabolic rate (also known as the resting energy expenditure)29. The two levels vary in countries depending on the composition and physical activity of the population. Food consumption of less than the first level would not allow a person to maintain their normal physical activity and keep their weight at the same time, and less than the basal metabolic rate would cause fast weight loss even with only sedentary activity and thus would quickly lead to death29. With a 5\u2009Tg injection, most nations show decreasing calorie intake relative to the 2010 level but still sufficient to maintain weight (Fig.4and Supplementary Fig.5). With larger soot-injection cases, severe starvation occurs in most of the mid\u2013high latitude nations under theLivestock Case. When 50% of food-competing feed is converted for human consumption in each nation, some nations (such as the United States) would maintain sufficient calorie intake under scenarios with smaller soot injections, but weight loss or even severe starvation would occur under larger soot-injection cases (Fig.4and Supplementary Fig.5).\nThe left map is the calorie intake status in 2010 with no international trade; the left column is theLivestock case; the middle column is thePartial Livestockcase, with 50% of livestock feed used for human food and the other 50% still used to feed livestock; and the right column is theNo Livestockcase, with 50% of livestock feed used for human food. All maps assume no international trade and that the total calories are evenly distributed within each nation. Regions in green mean food consumption can support the current physical activity in that country; regions in yellow are calorie intake that would cause people to lose weight, and only sedentary physical activity would be supported; and regions in red indicate that daily calorie intake would be less than needed to maintain a basal metabolic rate (also called resting energy expenditure) and thus would lead to death after an individual exhausted their body energy reserves in stored fat and expendable muscle28. 150\u2009Tg\u2009+\u200950% waste is half of the household waste added to food consumption, and 150\u2009Tg\u2009+\u2009100% waste is all household waste added to food consumption.\nUnder the 150\u2009Tg scenario, most nations would have calorie intake lower than resting energy expenditure29. One exception is Australia. After we turn off international trade, wheat contributes almost 50% of the calorie intake in Australia, and production of rice, maize and soybean in Australia are less than 1% that of wheat23,24. Therefore, the wheat response to simulated nuclear wars largely determines calorie intake in Australia. Because spring wheat is used to represent wheat, and simulated spring wheat there shows increasing or small reductions under nuclear war scenarios in which more favourable temperatures occur for food production, the calorie intake in Australia is more than other nations. However, this analysis is limited by the FAO data, which are collected at national levels. Within each nation, particularly large ones, there may be large regional inequities driven by infrastructure limitations, economic structures and government policies. New Zealand would also experience smaller impacts than other countries. But if this scenario should actually take place, Australia and New Zealand would probably see an influx of refugees from Asia and other countries experiencing food insecurity.\nThe global average calorie supply post-war (Fig.5a) implies that extreme regional reductions (Fig.4) could be overcome to some extent through trade\u2014but equal distribution of food globally would probably be a major challenge. Under theLivestockcase, if food were evenly distributed over the world and household waste were 20% as in 201028, there would be enough food for everyone under the 5\u2009Tg scenario to support their normal physical activity; if household waste were reduced from 20% to 10%, extra calories would support everyone under the 16\u2009Tg scenario; and if there were no household waste, even under the 27\u2009Tg case, everyone would consume sufficient calories for survival. With the most optimistic case\u2014100% livestock crop feed to humans, no household waste and equitable global food distribution\ufeff\u2014there would be enough food production for everyone under the 47\u2009Tg case. Assuming international trade ceased and food was distributed optimally within each country11, such that the maximum number of people were given the calorie intake to maintain their weight and normal physical activity28, the percentage of population that could be supported can be calculated (Fig.5band Supplementary Fig.6b). Under the 150\u2009Tg case, most countries would have less than 25% of the population survive by the end of Year 2 (Supplementary Fig.7). In 2020, 720\u2009million\u2013811\u2009million people suffered from undernutrition worldwide30, despite food production being more than sufficient to nourish a larger world population. Thus, it is likely that food distribution would be inequitable both between and within countries.\na, Global average change in calorie intake per person per day in Year 2 post-war under theLivestockcase (yellow bars) and for thePartial Livestockcase (red bars), assuming that all food and waste is evenly distributed. For thePartial Livestockcase, additional calories potentially available by human consumption of animal feed, mainly maize and soybeans, are plotted for various portions of converted animal feed (pink tick marks), and the remaining livestock crop feed is used for raising livestock. Critical food intake levels are marked in the right margin.b, Without international trade, the global population (%) that could be supported, although underweight, by domestic food production at the end of Year 2 after a nuclear war if they receive the calories supporting their regular physical activity29and the rest of the population would receive no food, under theLivestockandPartial Livestockcases. The blue line inbshows the percentage of population that can be supported by current food production when food production does not change but international trade is stopped. National data are calculated first (Supplementary Tables4and5and Supplementary Fig.5) and then aggregated to global data.\nUsing state-of-the-art climate, crop and fishery models, we calculate how the availability of food supplies could change globally under various nuclear war scenarios. We combine crops and marine fish and also consider whether livestock and animal products continue to be an important food source.\nFor a regional nuclear war, large parts of the world may suffer famine\u2014even given the compensating behaviours considered in this paper. Using crops fed to livestock as human food could offset food losses locally but would make limited impacts on the total amount of food available globally, especially with large atmospheric soot injections when the growth of feed crops and pastures would be severely impaired by the resulting climate perturbation. Reducing household food waste could help in the small nuclear war cases but not in the larger nuclear wars due to the large climate-driven reduction in overall production. We find particularly severe crop declines in major exporting countries such as Russia and the United States, which could easily trigger export restrictions and cause severe disruptions in import-dependent countries24. Our no-trade response illustrates this risk\u2014showing that African and Middle Eastern countries would be severely affected.\nOur analysis of the potential impacts of nuclear war on the food system does not address some aspects of the problem, leaving them for future research. In all the responses, we do not consider reduced human populations due to direct or indirect mortality and possible reduced birth rate. The total number and composition of population changes would affect available labour, calorie production and distribution. Also, we do not consider farm-management adaptations such as changes in cultivar selection, switching to more cold-tolerating crops or greenhouses31and alternative food sources such as mushrooms, seaweed, methane single cell protein, insects32, hydrogen single cell protein33and cellulosic sugar34. Although farmer adaptation35and alternative food sources could reduce the negative impact from a simulated nuclear war, it would be challenging to make all the shifts in time to affect food availability in Year 2, and further work should be done on these interventions. Current food storage can alleviate the shortage in Year 1 (ref.14) but would have less impact on Year 2 unless it were rationed by governments or by the market. Expanding or shifting cropping land to favourable climate regions would increase crop production. Further studies on adaptation and the impacts on short-term food availability are needed, but those topics are beyond the scope of this study. Adaptation in fisheries is also not considered, such as changes in the use of discarded bycatch and offal in fisheries. These include reduced availability of fuel, fertilizer and infrastructure for food production after a war, the effects of elevated ultraviolet radiation36on food production and radioactive contamination37. While this analysis focuses on calories, humans would also need proteins and micronutrients to survive the ensuing years of food deficiency (we estimate the impact on protein supply in Supplementary Fig.3). Large-scale use of alternative foods, requiring little-to-no light to grow in a cold environment38, has not been considered but could be a lifesaving source of emergency food if such production systems were operational.\nIn conclusion, the reduced light, global cooling and likely trade restrictions after nuclear wars would be a global catastrophe for food security. The negative impact of climate perturbations on the total crop production can generally not be offset by livestock and aquatic food (Fig.5a). More than 2 billion people could die from a nuclear war between India and Pakistan, and more than 5 billion could die from a war between the United States and Russia (Table1). The results here provide further support to the 1985 statement by US President Ronald Reagan and Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev and restated by US President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2021 that \u2018a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought\u2019.\nWe use a state-of-the-art global climate model to calculate the climatic and biogeochemical changes caused by a range of stratospheric soot injections, each associated with a nuclear war scenario18(Tables1and2). Simulated changes in surface air temperature, precipitation and downward direct and diffuse solar radiation are used to force a state-of-the-art crop model to estimate how the productivity of the major crops (maize, rice, spring wheat and soybean) would be affected globally, and changes in oceanic net primary production and sea surface temperature are used to force a global marine fisheries model. We combine these results with assumptions about how other crop production, livestock production, fish production and food trade could change and calculate the amount of food that would be available for each country in the world after a nuclear war.\nThe simulated surface climate disruptions due to the nuclear war scenarios are summarized in Fig.1. Averaged over the current crop regions, surface downwelling solar radiation reduces by 10\u2009W\u2009m\u22122(5\u2009Tg soot injection) to 130\u2009W\u2009m\u22122(150\u2009Tg soot injection). With less energy received, the maximum average 2\u2009m air temperature reductions range from 1.5\u2009\u00b0C (5\u2009Tg soot injection) to 14.8\u2009\u00b0C (150\u2009Tg soot injection), peaking within 1\u20132 years after the war, with temperature reduction lasting for more than 10 years. The cooling also reduces precipitation over summer monsoon regions. Similar but smaller reductions of solar radiation and temperature are projected in marine regions (Fig.1b,d), with resulting changes in lower trophic-level marine primary productivity. We applied local changes at every grid cell to the crop and fish models.\nAll nuclear war scenarios9,18are simulated using the Community Earth System Model (CESM)39. This model includes interactive atmosphere, land, ocean and sea ice. Both atmosphere and land have a horizontal resolution of 1.9\u00b0\u2009\u00d7\u20092.5\u00b0, and the ocean has a horizontal resolution of 1\u00b0. The atmospheric model is the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model version 4 (ref.40). The land model is the Community Land Model version 4 with the carbon\u2013nitrogen cycle. CESM output at 1- and 3-hour resolution, including 2\u2009m air temperature, precipitation, specific humidity and downward longwave radiation and solar radiation (separated into direct and diffuse radiation), is used to drive the offline crop model simulations. There are three ensemble members of the control simulation, which repeats the climate forcing of 2000 for 15 years, three ensemble members of the 5\u2009Tg case and one simulation for each other nuclear war scenario.\nIn all the simulations, the soot is arbitrarily injected during the week starting on May 15 of Year 1. Our scenarios assume that all stored food is consumed in Year 1 and we present analysis of the remaining food in Year 2. If the war occurred at the end of a calendar year, there would still be food available in Year 2, so what we label Year 2 should be relabelled Year 3. However, since the severe climate and food impacts last for more than 5 years (Figs.1and2), the same conclusions apply to a world after a nuclear war.\nBecause climate models have biases, it is typical to bias correct model output before using it as input for crop models. There are various techniques that attempt to use past observational data to address changes in the mean and variance, but none are perfect and all are limited by assumptions that future relations between model output and crop model input can be based on the recent past. A common method14is the delta method in which an observational reanalysis weather dataset is used and monthly means of temperature, precipitation and insolation are modified according to the climate model simulations. This comes with the advantage of realistic internal variability important for crop modelling12,13,14but does not adjust changes in variance, which might be an unrealistic assumption under higher emission scenarios, such as the 150\u2009Tg case. Here, because we are using a crop model that has already been calibrated with the same climate model that we are using, we use raw climate model output (1.9\u00b0\u2009\u00d7\u20092.5\u00b0) to force the crop model, and this allows variance to change too.\nCrop simulation uses the Community Land Model version 5 crop (CLM5crop)41,42,43in the Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2). Dynamic vegetation is not turned on. CLM5crop has six active crops, maize, rice, soybeans, spring wheat, sugar cane and cotton, and also simulates natural vegetation, such as grasses. In this study, we used the output of the cereals (maize, rice, soybeans and spring wheat) and grasses. Although CLM5crop does not simulate winter wheat, we assume winter wheat production is changed by the same amount as spring wheat, which has been found in other studies14; however, this may underestimate the winter wheat response, because winter wheat would experience colder temperatures during its growing period that would be more likely to cross critical thresholds14. Surface ozone and downward ultraviolet radiation would also be impacted by nuclear war36, but CLM5crop is not able to consider those impacts, which might exacerbate the losses. In addition, the crop model does not consider the availability of pollinators, killing frost and alternative seeds. The model simulates rainfed crops and irrigated crops separately, and all results presented here refer to the total production of rainfed and irrigated crops. Irrigated crops are simulated under the assumption that freshwater availability is not limiting43. Although evaporation is reduced with cooling, it is possible that our result may underestimate the negative impact from precipitation reduction, especially for the large injection cases.\nCLM5crop was evaluated41using FAO observations (average of 1991\u20132010), and it does a reasonable job of reproducing observed spatial pattern of maize, rice, soybean and spring wheat yield. Also, time series of crop yields simulated by CLM5crop compare with FAO data from 2006 to 2018, and CLM5crop reasonably represents global total production and average yields of maize, rice, soybean and spring wheat42.\nCLM5crop is spun up for 1,060 years by repeating the past 10 years of the CESM control to reach the equilibrium of four soil carbon pools. The crop simulations are at the same resolution as CESM simulations (1.9\u00b0\u2009\u00d7\u20092.5\u00b0). The crop planting date is determined by growing degree days, and the location of cropland is fixed for all crops.\nFish and fisheries responses are simulated with the BiOeconomic mArine Trophic Size-spectrum (BOATS) model15,44,45. BOATS was used to calculate the size-structured biomass of commercially targeted fish based on gridded (1\u00b0 horizontal resolution) inputs of sea surface temperature and oceanic net primary production from CESM. The model also interactively simulates fishing effort and fish catch through a bioeconomic component that depends on fish price, cost of fishing, catchability and fisheries regulation15. Details are found in ref.15and references therein.\nSupplementary Table1shows the total calorie reductions for each of the nine nuclear states from just the simulated crops and marine fish. Data for countries can be found in Supplementary Table2.\nTo calculate nation-level calories available from simulated crops and fish, we weight the production by the calorie content of each type of food. We use data from FAO23,24,46,47. Nation-level calorie reduction (%) from total production of maize, rice, soybean, wheat and marine fish is thus calculated as:\nand\nwhere indexiis maize, rice, soybean, wheat or marine fish wild catch,wiyis the calorie weight of each commodity per country each year,Piis the national production of itemiin FAO-Food Balance Sheet (FBS)23,24,ciis calories per 100\u2009g dry mass for each item23,Riyis national production reduction (%) of each item in yearyafter the nuclear wars andRyis nation-averaged calorie reduction (%) of the five items in yearyafter the nuclear wars.\nNational averaged calorie reduction (%) of the four simulated crops is applied to the total calories of all crops in 2010 to estimate simulated nuclear war impacts on this category.\nWe assume these two types of food share a similar response to simulated nuclear war as they involve feeding animals in a relatively controlled environment. For global calculations for livestock, we assume that 46% are fed by pasture and 54% are fed by crops and processed products48and use national-level data26to calculate reduction of livestock feed from pasture and crop-based products. We assume that livestock production is linearly correlated with the feed. Annual leaf carbon of grasses (both C3 and C4) is used to estimate pasture changes, and reduction of the four simulated crops is used for crop feed changes. For aquaculture, the feed is only from crops and processed products, and the production is also correlated with the amount of feed fish receive. Direct climate change impacts on livestock and fish are not considered.\nInland fish capture is not considered in this study. Because inland fish contribute only 7% of total fish production46, adding inland fisheries would not change the main conclusions of this study.\nAll food commodity trade calculations are based on the 2010 FAO Commodity Balance Sheet (FAO-CBS), FAO-FBS and processed data from previous studies24,27,28,47. This dataset provides the production and usage of each food and non-food agricultural product for each country and imports and exports and thus allows the calculation on a national basis of food usage and calorie availability.\nDomestic availability of a food in each country comes from domestic production and reserves, reduced by exports and increased by imports. We calculate no international trade by applying the ratio of domestic production and domestic supply to each food category and the food production in different usages:\nwhereCfoodis national-level calorie supply from different food types26,46,Cfood-notradeis national-level calorie supply from different food types with the assumption of no international trade,Pdpis national-level domestic production for each type of food in FAO-CBS andPdsis national-level domestic supply for each type of food in FAO-CBS. Domestic supply is the available food on the market, including domestic production, export and import.\nFood usage of maize, soybean, rice and wheat is calculated from FAO-CBS. In FAO-CBS, maize products are maize and byproduct maize germ oil, soybean products are soybean and byproducts soybean oil and soybean cake, rice products are rice and byproduct rice bran oil and wheat product is wheat. Products for food purposes are the sum of food supply in each category and the processing product minus the total byproducts (the difference includes processing for the purpose of alcohol or sugar).\nFor theLivestockcase, national-level available calories are calculated by\nwhereCLis calories available in each nationL(kcal per capita per day) under theLivestockcase,Cplantbased,Clivestock-ruminantandClivestock-monogastricare calories available from plant-based products, ruminants and monogastrics27andCaquacultureandCmarine-catchare calculated by calorie availability from fish27multiplied by the ratio of aquaculture and catch46.Rgrassis grass production change, andRmarine-catch-yis marine capture change.Fruminant-cropfeedis the fraction of crop feed for ruminant, andFmonogastric-cropfeedis the fraction of crop feed for monogastrics26.Rcyis crop production change calculated as:\nand\nwhere indexiis maize, rice, soybean or wheat,wiyis the calorie weight of each commodity per country each year,Piis the national production of itemiin FAO-CBS47,ciis calories per 100\u2009g retail weight for each item23andRiyis national production change (%) of each item in yearyafter the nuclear wars.\\(f_\\mathrm{final - product - biofuel}\\)is the fraction of final product of biofuel in plant-based product, andffoodis the fraction of food in plant-based product.\nFor theNo Livestockcase, national-level available calories are calculated by\nCNLis national-level available calories in theNo Livestockcase.ffeed-to-foodis the fraction of food crops that are used as feed relative to their usage as food, calculated based on their calorie content26.pfeed-for-humanis the percentage of livestock grain feed used for human consumption.

On the basis of the assumed percentage of livestock crop feed to convert to human consumption, instead of wasting the remaining portion of livestock crop feed as inNo Livestockcase, here we use the remaining livestock crop feed to raise livestock.\nThe percentage of national household waste is calculated by\nPwasteis the percentage of national household waste of food calorie availability in 2010,Cavailableis the food calorie availability per day per person in each country andCintakeis the national calorie intake per day per person27.\nThe population percentage supported by available calories calculated for theLivestock, Partial LivestockandNo Livestockresponses indicates the macro-level consequences for food security (Fig.4). The current average human available calorie supply is 2,855\u2009kcal per capita per day, including food intake and food waste (Fig.3). Calorie requirements vary significantly with age, gender, size, climate, level of activity and underlying medical conditions. Ref.27estimated the national-level calorie availability, calorie intake, calorie from plant-based product, livestock and fish and also calculated the calorie intake of an underweight population with current physical activity of an underweight population with sedentary physical activity and calorie intake lower than the basal metabolic rate. We assume that the calorie intake of an underweight population with current physical activity is needed to support life and regular labour activity.\nThis work was done with one Earth system model, with only one ensemble member for all the cases with soot injections >5\u2009Tg, only one crop model and only one fishery model. For the 5\u2009Tg case and the control, there are three ensemble members, but only the ensemble averages are used. The three ensemble members for the 5\u2009Tg case are very similar (Supplementary Fig.8), so climate variability for the larger forcings would be much smaller than the signal.\nCESM is a state-of-the-art climate model, and its simulations of the impacts of nuclear war have been almost identical to simulations with other models for the 5\u2009Tg (refs.49,50) and 150\u2009Tg (ref.9) cases. However, further developments in climate models, such as including organic carbon in fire emissions, and better simulating aerosol growth and interactions with the surrounding environment, may improve climate prediction after a nuclear war.\nCLM5crop and BOATS are also state-of-the-art models, but future simulations with different models would certainly be useful. CLM5crop compares well with other crop models in response to nuclear war forcing14(Supplementary Fig.2). If anything, CLM5crop underestimates the crop response to nuclear war (Fig.2and Supplementary Fig.2). Because most crop models were developed for the current or warmer climates, further research is needed to understand how crops react to a suddenly cold environment. Our study is the first step to reveal national food security after nuclear wars, but crops may not respond uniformly to the same forcing in each nation, given different farming practices. In addition, multi-model assessment will be essential to fully investigate this problem, and crop model developments are important to understand impacts from surface ozone, ultraviolet radiation and freshwater availability. Furthermore, local radioactive contamination and climate change from nuclear war would impact the insect community. The influence on pests, pollinators and other insects is unclear, and hence further studies are needed.\nSome assumptions in this study could be examined in future work. For example, to turn off international trade, the ratio of local production to domestic supply is applied on a national level. Also, to calculate national calorie intake after nuclear wars, we assume that food is evenly distributed in each country. Economic models will be necessary to further understand the contributions of trade and local food distribution systems to human calorie intake after nuclear wars.\nThis study uses calorie intake from ref.27, and food loss from harvesting is not considered. If human behaviour and the food industry would change substantially, this would affect our conclusions.\nFurther information on research design is available in theNature Research Reporting Summarylinked to this article.\nData of crop yield, grass production, national livestock feed, national calorie and national plant product usage are available athttps:\/\/osf.io\/YRBSE\/.

Here we combine livestock heat stress frequency, dry matter feed production and water accessibility data to understand where environmental changes in NSSA\u2019s drylands are jeopardizing cattle milk production. We show that environmental conditions worsened for\u223c17% of the study area. Increasing goat and camel populations by\u223c14% (\u223c7.7 million) and\u223c10% (\u223c1.2 million), respectively, while reducing the dairy cattle population by\u223c24% (\u223c5.9 million), could result in\u223c0.14\u2009Mt (+5.7%) higher milk production, lower water (\u22121,683.6 million m3, \u221215.3%) and feed resource (\u2212404.3\u2009Mt, \u221211.2%) demand\u2014and lower dairy emissions by\u223c1,224.6\u2009MtCO2e (\u22127.9%). Shifting herd composition from cattle towards the inclusion of, or replacement with, goats and camels can secure milk production and support NSSA\u2019s dairy production resilience against climate change.\nLivestock-derived food products constitute about 35% of the agricultural gross domestic product (GDP) in north sub-Saharan Africa (NSSA)1,2and support the food security and livelihood of millions of people3. Within the livestock sector, dairy farming, which contributes\u223c28% to the livestock sector GDP (ranging from 12% in West Africa to 45% in East Africa)4, is a promising livelihood option for poor households in NSSA. Moreover, dairy products contribute to food security of many communities in the arid and semi-arid lands by supplying essential nutrients5, and provide\u223c5% of the total energy requirements of households in NSSA6. The majority of milk production in SSA occurs in NSSA (\u223c86% of total SSA milk production in 2019\u20132020), where the production has increased substantially over the past four decades (by\u223c3.3% per year, reaching\u223c30\u2009Mt, with\u223c65% of the total milk production coming from cattle,\u223c25% from small ruminants and\u223c10% from camels)6. This production increase is largely driven by increased livestock population rather than increased livestock productivity. Demand for milk has increased by 4.0% per annum in the last decades, pushed by both human population growth (of 2.8% per annum) and changes in per-capita consumption (0.8% per annum)7. Demand for dairy products is projected to triple by 2050 relative to the consumption levels of 20008. Most of the supply (\u223c90%) comes from traditional mixed crop\u2013livestock and extensive pastoral systems9. However, the ability of these systems to sustainably produce sufficient milk to meet these demands is increasingly being challenged by the impacts of climate-related stressors on feed production, water access, heat stress and disease risks10,11.\nThe climate in NSSA has already changed during the past several decades and is expected to continue to change12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22. Such changes are expected to affect livestock feed availability23,24, water resource availability16,25and thermal comfort26,27in many of the drylands in NSSA. Analysis of historical (1981\u20132010) and future climate projections (2021\u20132050 and 2071\u20132100), for example, shows that\u223c11\u201315% of current milk production in the East Africa occurs in areas where the frequency of detrimental heat stress events are expected to increase significantly (P\u2264\u20090.05) by 2071\u2013210027.\nGiven the likely impacts of climate change on livestock systems, and the fact that pastoralist societies in the region are among the most vulnerable groups in the world28,29, a key question regarding sustainable milk production is whether current livestock systems are appropriate for dealing with future environmental challenges. When considering adaptation options, it is necessary also to take environmental impacts into account because dairy farming in SSA already maintains the highest greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per kg of fat and protein corrected milk (FPCM) in comparison to other parts of the world (7.5\u2009CO2equivalent (CO2e) per kg FPCM versus a global average of 2.4)30. There have been multiple reports documenting where pastoralist communities in drylands of NSSA (for example, Woda\u00e2be in Niger, Massa\u00ef in Kenya, Borana in Ethiopia, Nuer in South Sudan, and Fulani in West Africa) have adjusted their livestock composition in response to environmental extremes and changing ecological conditions, mostly by shifts from cattle to small ruminants (mainly goat) and\/or camels31,32,33,34. Browsers (that is, camels and goats) in some pastoralist communities are preferred over grazers (that is, cattle) due to their greater climate resilience, resulting from their higher tolerance to drought and feed scarcity, as well as their capacity to produce milk and meat in all seasons33,35,36,37,38. The shifting preference for browsers (that is, favouring camels and goats over cattle) due to recent climate variability\/change, and associated feed and water shortage was confirmed by over 71.5% of the interviewed households from a survey of the Borana community from Isiolo County, northern Kenya39.\nWhereas different livestock species have different climate resilience and tolerances40,41,42,43,44,45,46, location-specific data are required to assess where shifts in herd composition from currently cattle-dominated systems are needed to maintain or even increase dairy production in semi-arid and arid systems under climate change. Therefore, the aims of this study are (1) to assess where in the drylands of NSSA these shifts in herd composition are most likely to occur as an adaptive response to changes in climatic and biophysical conditions, and (2) to determine the possible impact of shifting dairy production from cattle to more climate-resilient goats and camels, in terms of aggregate milk production and environmental sustainability.\nFor the current study, the annual dry matter biomass production (DMP; Modelling DMP), water accessibility (using the water accessibility index (WAI); Modelling WAI in theMethods) and heat stress (HS) frequency (Modelling HS frequency) were assessed for the period 2001\u20132020 using long-term climate and remotely sensed data for dryland NSSA (Datasets used in theMethods). Fig.1shows the simulated long-term averages of the three components and their regional trends over the 2001\u20132020 period.\na\u2013c, Long-term average annual DMP (a), WAI (b) and HS (c).d\u2013f, Regional significant trends (P\u2264\u20090.05) in DMP (d), WAI (e) and HS (f) over the past two decades (2001\u20132020).\nThe long-term average annual DMP in the study area was\u223c30\u2009t\u2009ha\u22121yr\u22121, ranging from almost zero in more arid lands of the north to\u223c53\u2009t\u2009ha\u22121yr\u22121in the southern parts of NSSA. Trend analysis (Statistical test) showed that, apart from the greening zone in the Sahel47(\u223c19% of the study area), there were significant decreasing trends (P\u2264\u20090.05) in DMP observed in\u223c9% of the study area.\nThe annual WAI follows a different pattern and is related to the presence of water bodies, with an average of\u223c0.04 for the whole region. Areas with low (0\u20130.2) and high (0.8\u20131) WAI cover\u223c80% and\u223c3% of the study area, respectively (Fig.1b). The results showed a significant decreasing trend (P\u2264\u20090.05) in WAI in\u223c15% of the study area. However, it should be noted that our WAI does not account for the presence of wells and groundwater resources due to lack of data and because surface water represents the dominant water source for livestock in NSSA.\nThe average frequency of detrimental HS events for milk production during 2001\u20132020 was estimated at 77 days per year (\u223c21% of the year), and was more frequent in coastal areas of the Greater Horn region, where it exceeds 50% of the days in a given year. Figure1also shows that over the past two decades, the frequency of HS events detrimental to milk production has significantly increased (P\u2264\u20090.05) in\u223c38% of the study area.\nWe used the criteria explained inData analysisto assess where the changes in the aforementioned indicators of DMP, WAI and HS have significantly worsened the climatic and biophysical conditions for milk production from cattle in the Sahel and Greater Horn study area. Our results indicate that conditions have recently worsened in 17% of the study area (\u223c1.7\u2009million\u2009km2) due to changes in environmental conditions (Fig.2). The affected area is home to\u223c14.2 million cattle,\u223c18.11 million goats and\u223c2.99 million camels.\nQuadrats A\u2013J show the location of 10 case studies reporting shifts in herd composition from cattle to goats and camels: A, East Pokot, Kenya35,109,110,111; B, Isiolo County, Kenya39,109,110,111; C, Afar region, Ethiopia112,113,114; D, Ngorongoro, Tanzania115,116; E, Yabelo, Ethiopia112,113; F, Moyale, Ethiopia112,113,117; G, Jijiga, Ethiopia112,118; H, Guban zone, Somalia (Somaliland)119; I, Misseriyya communities, Sudan120,121,122; J, Kaduna and Kano states, Nigeria123,124.a\u2013c, The shares for quadrats A\u2013C.\nTo provide corroboration and documentation of shifts in herd composition in the region, we conducted a comprehensive review of case studies for areas where pastoralists have already begun shifting from cattle to goats and camels to sustain their livelihood activities amid changing environmental conditions (case studies areas shown by dashed boxes in Fig.2). We found ten cases in dryland NSSA where the transition from cattle to goats and camels is already evident (East Pokot and Isiolo County in Kenya; Ngorongoro in Tanzania; Afar, Yabelo, Moyale and Jijiga in Ethiopia; Somaliland in Somalia; Misseriyya pastoralists in Sudan; Kaduna and Kano States in Nigeria) and these overlap with our identified areas of deteriorating conditions. On average, according to the Gridded Livestock of the World, v.3 (GLW3), dairy livestock species composition in these areas consisted of\u223c41% cattle,\u223c50% goat and\u223c9% camel in 2010 (for detailed information on dairy livestock species composition in each subregion, see Supplementary Table1).\nWe modelled the impact of shifting livestock species composition on aggregate milk production and water\/feed consumption of all dairy livestock across dryland NSSA. Furthermore, we assessed environmental impacts of shifts in herd composition across all species in the region. We prioritized milk production, followed by water\/feed consumption and finally GHG emissions to identify the \u2018ideal\u2019 herd composition with the following features: (1) maximum productivity in terms of aggregate milk production, (2) lowest feed\/water consumption and (3) lowest ruminant GHG emission across all three species in the entire study area. We also tested three extreme scenarios of shifting herd composition by considering the maximum possible reduction of cattle population in favour of camels and\/or goats. We assumed that for arid regions all cattle may be replaced by camels and\/or goats, while for semi-arid regions only half of the cattle population may be replaced. The latter scenarios were conducted to assess trade-offs among different possible herd compositions in the region.\nResults shown in Fig.3demonstrate that, overall, decreasing cattle population by\u223c24% and increasing goat and camel population by\u223c14 and\u223c10%, respectively, resulted in an ideal herd composition across all metrics assessed. Reducing the current cattle population by\u223c5.9 million and increasing goat and camel populations by\u223c7.7 million and\u223c1.2 million, respectively, not only achieves a slight increase in aggregate milk production (+0.14\u2009Mt), but also results in an effective reduction in water (\u22121,683.6\u2009million\u2009m3) and feed consumption (\u2212404.3\u2009Mt), and GHG emissions (\u22121,224.6\u2009MtCO2e). In addition to \u2018idealized\u2019 scenarios where outcomes were optimized for both milk production and environmental benefits, we ran three \u2018extreme\u2019 scenarios that did not optimize based on all metrics. For these scenarios, we assumed that the shift from cattle occurred at the maximum possible rate (that is, 100% to camel, 100% to goat, 50% to camel\/50% to goat), as shown in Fig.3. The three \u2018extreme\u2019 scenarios resulted in reduced benefits compared with the \u2018idealized\u2019 scenarios where all metrics were considered (for detailed results for each subregion, see Supplementary Table1). For example, in case of the 100% to goat scenario, although replacing 100% of cattle with goats has advantages in terms of feed usage (\u221215%), water consumption (\u221233%) and GHG emission (\u22129%), milk production in this scenario would drop by 26%.\nThe results of the optimized and the three extreme scenarios for shifting from cattle to goat\/camel to maintain the current milk production level and improve water\/feed consumption and GHG emissions.\nEnvironmental changes have already undermined food security in cattle-dominated systems in dryland NSSA48,49,50. In general, this could be dealt with by reducing the number of cattle in areas where challenges are expected. Reductions in cattle could be accomplished either by shifting towards other, non-meat-based diets, or by shifting toward other livestock species, which could improve both food security and reduce emissions at the regional level. However, although reducing animal-sourced proteins has been shown to be important in improving diet and reducing emissions from intensive livestock systems in the Global North51, such reductions in NSSA and developing countries more generally need to be weighed against the critical role that animal proteins play in nutrition, particularly in pastoralist and agropastoral communities where undernutrition and malnutrition are common52. Therefore, achieving these goals through reduced consumption of animal-sourced protein is not appropriate in many parts of dryland NSSA53. A more viable option in these areas would be to change herd composition in favour of species that perform better under harsh environmental conditions (that is, camel and goat)54, while devoting more research to these issues. To fill the current knowledge gaps associated with simultaneous changes in climate and feed and water resource availability, this study uses the most reliable datasets available to demonstrate where in the study region shifts in herd composition are likely to be more pronounced (based on climatic and biophysical conditions), and to what extent switching from grazing- to browsing-dominated livestock may be beneficial in terms of milk production, water and feed consumption, and GHG emissions. Based on our results, milk production from cattle is expected to become more challenging in approximately one-fifth of the region due to changes in DMP, WAI and HS. The results of optimizing the herd composition in these regions indicate that shifting dairy production toward climate-resilient species (that is, goats and camels) may represent a \u2018win\u2013win\u2019 scenario for dryland NSSA that not only increases aggregate milk production, but also decreases the environmental footprint of milk production in terms of water use, feed consumption and GHG emissions at the regional scale.\nAlthough we tried to comprehensively cover possible drivers, there may be other potential drivers such as changes in woody cover and groundwater level affecting herd composition for which there is limited data and process understanding at present. Based on available information about changes in woody cover derived from satellite passive microwave observations55, there has been an increasing trend in woody cover in\u223c46.5% of areas where challenges are expected (in 38% and 55% of subregions located in arid and semi-arid climate zones by 0\u20135% (on average +0.47%) and 0\u201314% (on average +0.51%), respectively) between 1992 and 2011. Although we did not consider this as a potential driving factor for shifts in herd composition due to the lack of spatially explicit data on changes in woody vegetation, the results reported here support the hypothesis that shifting dairy production to camels and goats may be more compatible with increases in woody vegetation56. With regard to groundwater as another source for watering of livestock, checking the output of the WaterGAP v.2.2d model for groundwater level changes during 2001\u2013201657reveals that, for the majority of the areas where challenges are expected (\u223c90%), no significant changes (P\u2264\u20090.05) were reported, while the trend was significantly (P\u2264\u20090.05) increasing or decreasing in\u223c8% and\u223c2% of the region, respectively. Nevertheless, there is little to no reliable, comprehensive data on how much groundwater is used for the livestock sector, and how infrastructure for groundwater supply has changed in the last several decades58,59.\nIn this study, it was assumed that energy values for milk across species were similar (262, 270 and 259\u2009kJ per 100\u2009g of milk for cattle, goat and camel, respectively5). However, other studies have shown that the chemical composition of milk (that is, fat, protein, ash, vitamins, etc.) from livestock differs between species60,61,62,63,64,65depending on feeding practice, breed differences, lactation stage, management, analytical procedures, etc.66,67,68,69. In general, camel milk is known for having lower saturated fat and lactose, and higher minerals and vitamins (especially vitamin C and B vitamins) compared with cattle milk70.\nAlthough our study focuses on the dairy sector, it is important to note that these recommendations may also affect other roles livestock plays in rural communities. This is specifically true for the meat sector, where according to a recent study for the post-2020 period, the percentage share of beef supplied by the dairy sector in SSA is required to increase by 8% (from 69% to 77%)71to meet overall demand for non-dairy animal proteins. In this way, both camel and goat, known as adapted multipurpose animals, could potentially play vital roles as meat protein sources. According to the FAO statistics for 2020, cattle, small ruminants and camels contributed\u223c36%,\u223c12% and\u223c3% to total meat production in NSSA, respectively. It is notable that the growth rate of camel and goat meat production in NSSA was higher than for cattle (camel, +4.7%\u2009yr\u22121; goat, +3.8%\u2009yr\u22121; cattle, +2.5%\u2009yr\u22121)6. Camel meat is nutritionally comparable to beef, with lower intramuscular fat and cholesterol content, and higher iron content72.\nA shift from grazers to browsers might also affect other ecosystem services. Some research indicates that long-term browsing by livestock (that is, camels and goats) and wildlife species in dryland ecosystems may support more diverse vegetation in general and a higher proportion of pasture grasses available for grazing livestock specifically73. Thus, it may also be profitable for people in areas that are currently not projected to be negatively affected by changes in environmental conditions to increase their livestock diversity to strengthen their resilience against climate extremes.\nAdditionally, there are economic advantages from multispecies pastoralism because income diversification allows herders to better cope with economic, political and ecological instabilities. In some case studies, for example, it was shown that many households in the three most important Ethiopian pastoralist communities (the Afar in the northeast, the Borana in the south and the Somali in the east and southeast) have already diversified their income sources from livestock, to the extent that there are differences in household income depending on the extent of their engagement in multispecies herding38,74. Marketing and customer preferences for different goat and camel products vary greatly from one region to another, between rural and urban communities with different socioeconomic standards, and between different ethnic groups, and are changing over time. While in some regions milk production is of outstanding economic importance due to growing customer demand, in other regions meat production is the main revenue for livestock producers. For example, in Samburu County, Kenya, where camel rearing was not common historically, it has been reported that currently households prefer camel milk to other types of milk75. In the last decade, the market for goat and camel products has also substantially expanded in NSSA with increased demand and growing awareness of the health benefits of these products (specifically in the case of camel milk\/meat)76. For instance, rapid growth in the demand for camel milk and the camel milk value chain has been reported in Somalia77. Nevertheless, there are still economic barriers to shifting from dairy cattle to goat or camel, particularly because female camels are more expensive than dairy cattle. For example, in Kenyan livestock markets in 2021, one camel cost US$421\u2013526, which was equivalent to\u223c2\u20133 cattle or\u223c10 goats78. Another barrier to adoption of goats and camels is lack of knowledge and skills related to animal husbandry and management practices, and the start-up costs of purchasing additional equipment and technologies needed for goat and camel production. For instance, when shifting from cattle to camel, although a mature camel may offer a higher rate of economic return than cattle and goats (depending on farm type, livestock breed, feeding situation, location, etc.), camels may have financial drawbacks due to their lower reproductive rate compared with other species, which is due to their relatively late puberty (\u223c3\u2009yr) and longer calving interval (\u223c2\u2009yr).\nAlthough adapting milk production systems by changing the herd composition holds promise as an effective adaptation strategy against climate change while also creating environmental benefits, there are multiple challenges that must be overcome to facilitate uptake of these adaptation practices among livestock keepers in the region. Importantly, there should be a clearer policy framework in place to effectively support pastoralists and other livestock keepers through the development of the goat and camel dairy sectors at various scales (national, regional and international). Since our current knowledge of goat and camel production systems at local to regional scales remains insufficient compared with dairy cattle production in NSSA, livestock value chain actors and research organizations should employ a multisectoral approach that prioritizes future research on breeding, disease control and nutrition services for these species. For instance, future breeding should emphasize both heat-tolerant cattle breeds and increasing goat\/camel milk yields. Finally, improvements in goat and camel dairy supply chains\u2014such as processing technologies to improve dairy goat and camel product markets, facilities to transport milk to local markets79,80, and distribution and processing infrastructure for output markets\u2014are essential for harnessing the full potential of shifts in herd composition and realizing the vision of sustainable and food-secure dairy production in NSSA by 2030.\nThe study area for the current research comprised arid and semi-arid zones81in the Sudano-Sahel and Greater Horn of African regions of NSSA (defined in this study as 5\u00b0\u201320\u00b0\u2009N, 20\u00b0\u2009W\u201355\u00b0\u2009E) covering an area of\u223c10\u2009million\u2009km2. Supplementary Fig.1shows the average climate conditions for the study area. According to the GPWv4, the human population in the study area in 2010 was estimated to be around 256 million inhabitants82, mostly dependent on crop farming and livestock-husbandry activities for their livelihoods83. According to the GLW3 database, the total populations of cattle, goats and camels in the region were approximately 78, 105 and 14 million, respectively84.\nThe climatic data required for this analysis, that is, air temperature (\u00b0C) and the relative humidity (%) (Modelling HS frequency), were obtained from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis v.5\u2014Land (ERA5-Land) database85,86.\nThe total number of livestock in the study area have been extracted from the GLW3 database84. This dataset is a snapshot of the total number of cattle and goats per pixel for the year 2010. Furthermore, in this study the camel density map includes dromedary and Bactrian camel distribution, and is an unpublished model based on the methodology described in Robinson et al.87(Supplementary Fig.2).\nTo estimate supply and demand for milk, a global dataset provided by the FAO Global Perspective Studies Unit88was used. The dataset includes estimates of milk consumption, production, import and export, in 2000 and 2030, and their absolute and proportional changes (with a resolution of 0.05\u00b0).\nA dataset for the start and the end of the growing season, based on Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series89, was used for quantifying the DMP from remote sensing data (Modelling DMP).\nThe satellite products used in this study were acquired successively from the VEGETATION sensor of the SPOT4 and SPOT5 (Satellite Pour l\u2019Observation de la Terre) and PROBA-V (Project for On-Board Autonomy\u2013Vegetation) satellites via the Copernicus Global Land Service (CGLS) platform. The different products are:\nDMP (kg\u2009ha\u22121d\u22121) represents the overall growth rate or dry biomass increase of the vegetation and is directly related to ecosystem net primary productivity. This is retrieved using Monteith\u2019s90model to calculate the instantaneous daily DMP (kg\u2009ha\u22121d\u22121), as follows:\nDMP\u2009=\u2009RG\u2009\u00d7\u2009\u03b5i\u00d7\u2009\u03b5c\u00d7\u2009\u03b5b\u00d7\u200910,000\nwhere RG\u2009=\u2009the incident solar radiation at the Earth\u2019s surface (J\u2009m\u22122d\u22121);\u03b5i=\u2009the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR) or the interception efficiency of the vegetation calculated as\u03b5i=fAPAR=A+B\u00d7\u2009NDVI (ref.91), whereAandB=\u2009sensor heuristic calibration92;\u03b5c=\u2009the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation of the incident solar radiation (here, 0.48);\u03b5b=\u2009the conversion efficiency of PAR to vegetation productivity, as a function of temperature93. The version used is DMP 1\u2009km V1, which is specifically produced by the Flemish Institute for Technological Research (VITO) using an initial DMP algorithm94that offers better performance over semi-arid areas of low vegetation production.\nNDVI v.1, 1\u2009km.\nSmall Water Bodies (SWB) provides Boolean information on the presence of surface water95. The version used is 1\u2009km Africa V1.\nAll datasets were used with temporal extent from April 1998 to January 2021 and with 10 day frequency.\nHerd composition is often constrained by a variety of contextual variables ranging from climatic and biophysical properties to levels of economic, social and infrastructural development. From the climatic and biophysical point of view, previous studies showed that feed and water shortage, and the occurrence and severity of climate extremes, are among the most important driving forces that could potentially lead to changes in herd composition in the study area23,34,39,96,97,98,99. In the following the procedure for modelling each of these factors during the period 2001\u20132020 is described.\nIn this study, the annual DMP, expressed as the cumulative total dry matter biomass produced over the growing season, was quantified by a validated tool, BioGenerator v.5.1100. This tool uses as main input the decadal DMP on which it operates cumulatively throughout the growing season.\nwhereyis the considered year, anddianddfare respectively the first decade and the last decade of cumulation.dianddfhave to be set to include the total vegetation annual peak of production with the constraint that thedineeds to be set to be before the start of the season but after the end of the season of the previous year, and conversely fordf. An analysis of study results on the growing period over Africa89permitted a satisfactory compromise that resulted in valid constant values over the whole study window:di=\u2009second decade of February anddf=\u2009first decade of February of the following year (y+\u20091).\nBefore cumulating, the DMP is temporally filtered using NDVI to remove noise and residual clouds. Filtering functions, based on best index slope extraction and a low-pass filter, are described in detail in the BioGenerator technical document100.\nSurface water accessibility was characterized using the HydroGenerator v.4.3 tool100. HydroGenerator uses the SWB product delivered by CGLS as its main input. HydroGenerator applies a 30\u2009km buffer ring around the detected cells, which are ranked with a decreasing Gaussian weighting function of distance to the point, called the WAI, as follows:\nwheredis the distance to the water point (km);\u03c3is a parameter of the Gaussian set to reach 1% beyond 30\u2009km (\\(\\sigma = \\frac{{{{{\\mathrm{30}}}}}}{{\\sqrt {2{{{\\mathrm{ln100}}}}} }}\\)); andFBGis the background WAI depending on aridity zones101(progressive evolution from hyper-arid\u2009=\u20090% to humid\u2009=\u2009100%). The WAI ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 representing no access to a water point and 1 representing the position of a permanent water point.\nIn this research we assessed the thermal HS conditions for dairy cattle by using the temperature\u2013humidity index (THI). For this purpose, first, the daily THI values were calculated based on formula developed by the National Research Council102and classified using the THI threshold for dairy cattle103:\nwhereTdbis the dry-bulb temperature (\u00b0C) (the daily maximum temperature was used instead ofTdbin this case, following previous research27); and RH\u2009is the relative humidity (%).\nThen, the percentage of occurrence of detrimental HS days (that is, events which result in substantial changes in milk production; above moderate and severe\/danger thresholds) over a year was calculated for each grid point and for the entire period (2001\u20132020) and used as a measure for the thermal (dis)comfort27.\nThe non-parametric Mann\u2013Kendall trend test104,105(H0, there is no trend; H1, there exists a downward or upward trend over time) and Sen\u2019s slope estimator106were used for detection of trends and the slopes of the trend in the time series (2001\u20132020) of DMP, HS and WAI at the 5% and 1% significance levels.\nAfter preparing the DMP, HS and WAI time series for each grid point (0.1\u00b0\u2009\u00d7\u20090.1\u00b0), a stepwise procedure was followed to answer the defined listed research questions.\nStep 1: where in the study area is the cattle production likely to be affected most?\nFour separate criteria were used to identify where in the study area conditions have become significantly worse for cattle production:\nIf all the three factors significantly changed at the 5% significance level: HS, increasing; DMP, decreasing; WAI, decreasing.\nIf the DMP significantly changed at the 1% significance level and if the quotient (DMP 2011\u20132020)\/(DMP 2001\u20132010) was <0.5.\nIf the HS significantly changed at the 1% significance level and the quotient of (HS 2011\u20132020)\/(HS 2001\u20132010) was >10%.\nIf the WAI significantly changed at the 1% significance level and the quotient (WAI 2011\u20132020)\/(WAI 2001\u20132010) was <0.5.\nStep 2: what is the current livestock population composition in regions where the criterion explained in step 1 has been satisfied (percentage of cattle, goats and camel)? What is the average milk supply and demand in these regions?\nExtract total livestock numbers (Livestock population dataset) and milk production and demand (Livestock milk supply and demand) in each of the grid cells where conditions have become significantly worse for cattle production. These data where used to calculate the average herd composition, in terms of percentage of cattle, goat and camels, and average milk supply and demand.\nStep 3: what is the relationship between milk production and herd composition in regions where the criterion explained in step 1 has been satisfied?\nTo establish how much of the milk production is coming from each species,Nequations with three unknowns were solved simultaneously;Ax+By+Cz=\u2009milk production of the grid point;x,y,z=\u2009the numbers of cattle, goats and camels, respectively;A,B,C=\u2009milk production of cattle, goats and camels, respectively.\nAfter fitting the distribution function to theA,BandCvalues, the average values have been used as the ideal herd composition for the remainder of the analysis (cattle\u2009=\u2009171, goat\u2009=\u200968, camel\u2009=\u2009295) (Supplementary Fig.3).\nStep 4: how much feed and water are needed to produce 1\u2009kg of milk? What are the GHG emissions associated with 1\u2009kg of milk from cattle, goats and camels?\nWe conducted a literature review to determine the water usage, feed consumption and GHG emissions associated with the production of 1\u2009kg of milk from cattle, goats and camels. The values reported from previous research on the water and feed usage for 1\u2009kg of milk from cattle, goats and camels and their GHG emissions, mostly for arid and semi-arid regions of SSA, are shown in Supplementary Figs. 4\u20136. In this study, the average values have been used for the rest of the analysis, wherein kg feed DM per kg milk from cattle\u2009=\u20091.78, goat\u2009=\u20091.43, camel\u2009=\u20091.17; litres of water per kg milk from cattle\u2009=\u20095.73, goat\u2009=\u20092.73, camel\u2009=\u20094.90; kgCO2e per kg milk from cattle\u2009=\u20097.25, goat\u2009=\u20096.70, camel\u2009=\u20096.00. Estimates of GHGs emitted to produce 1\u2009kg of milk are based on published studies on CH4emissions from enteric fermentation and both CH4and N2O emissions from livestock manure management under extensive and mixed farming systems in dryland NSSA (see Supplementary Figs. 4\u20136for references to these studies).\nStep 5: what happens if we shift from cattle toward goats or camels in regions where the criterion explained in step 1 has been satisfied? What is the ideal scenario, that is, where the quantity of milk be produced is the same or increased, but with less water\/feed consumption and GHG emissions (for each subregion and as an average)?\nHere, we changed the herd composition towards having fewer cattle such that the total tropical livestock unit (TLU, 1 TLU\u2009=\u2009250\u2009kg bodyweight) was constant. In this step, each time after the herd composition was changed, values from steps 3 and 4 were used to assess outcomes in terms of milk production, water\/feed usage and GHG emissions. The first priority of the objective function was to maximize milk production (herd compositions with milk production more than the 75th percentile of all combinations). The second objective was to minimize the water\/feed usage and finally to have lower GHG emissions (herd compositions with water\/feed usage and GHG emissions less than the 25th percentile of all combinations). Pastoralists in arid areas may have lower general adaptive capacity due to lack of alternative livelihood opportunities, but may be more open to shifts in herd composition due to existing familiarity with multiple livestock species107. On the other hand, mixed farming systems in semi-arid areas will probably have less incentive to change their herd composition due to less familiarity with mixed herds and possessing greater assets compared with pastoralists108. Therefore, it was assumed that mixed systems would be more limited with respect to maximum potential reductions in cattle compared with more arid regions, where pastoralist systems predominate, and may be able to sustain larger maximum proportional reductions in cattle populations. To this end, when shifting from cattle to goats and camels in mixed crop\u2013livestock systems, we did not allow the proportional change in cattle in these systems for a given grid point to exceed half of current cattle population (Supplementary Table1).\nStep 6: what is the expected aggregate milk production for the ideal herd composition at the regional scale, and the feed and water requirements and GHG emissions associated with this level of milk production? How can shifts in herd composition contribute to closing the gap in projected milk demand for 2030?\nFurther information on research design is available in theNature Research Reporting Summarylinked to this article.\nThe ERA5-Land climate data from the ECMWF are available athttps:\/\/doi.org\/10.24381\/cds.e2161bac.

Through a dense network of on-farm surveys for the rice\u2013wheat system in this region, we show that contemporary wheat sowing dates have a central influence on achieved and attainable yields, superseding all other crop management, soil and varietal factors. We estimate that untapped wheat production potential will increase by 69% with achievable adjustments to wheat sowing dates without incurring undesirable trade-offs with rice productivity, irrigation requirements or profitability. Our findings also indicate that transformative gains in wheat yields are only possible in eastern India if rice and wheat are managed as a coupled system. Steps taken to \u2018keep time\u2019 through better management of the annual cropping calendar will pay dividends for food security, profitability and climate resilience now and as a foundation for adaptation to progressive climate change.\nWheat is a principal crop staple in South Asia with current cultivation extending across 36.1\u2009million\u2009ha; around 73% of this area is in India where wheat provides approximately 21% of the aggregate food energy and 17% of the dietary protein on a national scale1. Projections suggest that wheat production in India alone will need to increase from current levels of around 110\u2009million\u2009tons to 140\u2009million\u2009tons by 2050 to keep pace with domestic requirements2,3. Because reserves of potentially cultivatable land are extremely low in South Asia4, future production increases must emerge from yield intensification rather than cultivated area expansion. Hence, identifying the magnitude and causes of wheat yield gaps (that is, the difference between potential and achieved crop productivity) is essential for prioritizing and effectively targeting policies and programmes for sustainable agricultural development.\nSouth Asia\u2019s principal wheat growing area is the Indo\u2013Gangetic Plain, where dry-season wheat is commonly grown in rotation with wet-season rice (that is, the rice\u2013wheat system; hereafter referred to as the RW system). The RW system occupies about 10\u2009million\u2009ha in India5. The Western Indo\u2013Gangetic Plain includes the Indian states of Punjab and Haryana and has the highest mean levels of wheat productivity in the region (4.5\u2009t\u2009ha\u22121). However, modest yield gaps (9\u201312%) (ref.6) together with accelerating production challenges such as groundwater depletion have drawn into question the long-term sustainability and potential for yield intensification in these states7,8,9,10. As a consequence, Indian policymakers have prioritized staple crop intensification in the Eastern Ganges Plain (EGP) region, including Bihar state and the eastern districts of Uttar Pradesh state through initiatives such as Bringing the Green Revolution to eastern India to meet current and future food security challenges.\nWheat yield gaps in the EGP are among the highest in India6,11and have been variously attributed to a range of factors, including late sowing, use of older cultivars, complex weed flora, variable access and low utilization of irrigation water and labour shortages8,12,13,14. Late wheat sowing creates substantial climate hazards from heat stress by delaying crop reproductive growth into the spring period (that is, March through early April) when temperatures warm considerably. Heat stress reduces photosynthetic efficiency and can shorten the grain-filling duration through premature crop senescence, thereby reducing biomass production, harvest index and crop yield15,16. Although several studies have confirmed the importance of timely sowing for avoiding yield losses from heat stress17,18,19, the contribution of current sowing date patterns to yield gaps is insufficiently characterized in South Asia. Moreover, few contemporary studies assess the enabling factors that determine the capacity of farmers to make sowing date adjustments20. It is also important to note that the RW systems of South Asia are not simply a set of crops grown in sequence but rather reflect an interlinked set of management decisions that often involve yield or sustainability trade-offs5,10. Consideration of yield gaps is no exception and must be conceptualized at the cropping system level rather than for wheat alone21. In the context of this study, we use the concept of \u2018climate resilience\u2019 to refer to the capacity of planting date adjustments to enhance crop yields, yield potential and yield stability by reducing exposure to less favourable growing conditions22.\nBy combining field and household survey data, time series remotely sensed information and dynamic crop simulation, this study of RW systems in the EGP of India has four interlinked objectives: (1) quantification of the importance of planting dates to current wheat yields, yield potential (Yp) and yield gaps (YG), (2) ex ante opportunity assessment of gains in wheat yield potential achievable through planting date adjustments, (3) identification of enabling and constraining factors that contribute to the timing of wheat planting and (4) simulation-based assessment of RW system-level strategies for enhancing climate resilience through planting date adjustments. Together, these objectives seek to establish the importance of cropping calendar management (\u2018keeping time\u2019) to the performance of RW systems in the stress-prone EGP to inform sustainable intensification and climate adaptation strategies in the region.\nTo contextualize the overall significance of wheat establishment dates to actual yield outcomes under the diversity of cropping system factors in the study\u2019s area of interest (AOI), machine learning analytics were applied to on-farm observational data from landscape-scale diagnostic surveys. The absolute and relative importance of factors that are influenced by management decisions were determined. Two different models were developed to reflect the enhanced nature of the survey questionnaire, soils data and sampling design in 2018. Farmer-estimated wheat yields were reported in 2018, whereas physical crop cuts were conducted in previous years, an approach that is probably more reliable but also more difficult and costly to implement at scale. Despite characterizing a richer set of system characteristics in 2018, this difference in yield assessment methods probably explains the slightly inferior validationR2(0.40) and modest improvement in RMSE (0.67\u2009t\u2009ha\u22121) values compared with the model developed for 2013\u20132017. That said, both models identified sowing date as the strongest predictor of yield outcomes (Supplementary Table1).\nFrom the 2018 survey year, the median sowing date was 27 November with an interquartile range from 20 November to 5 December. Across the entire survey sample, the mean wheat yield (Yactual) was 2.9\u2009t\u2009ha\u22121. By segregating the data into planting date terciles, that is, early (before 20 November), medium (20 November to 4 December) and late (after 4 December), a clear pattern emerges with mean early sowing yields (3.4\u2009t\u2009ha\u22121) greatly exceeding both average (2.9\u2009t\u2009ha\u22121) and later sowing dates (2.5\u2009t\u2009ha\u22121). Farmers sowing early achieved wheat productivity levels nearly 1\u2009t\u2009ha\u22121higher than those sowing late, representing a 36% increase in achieved yields.\nBoundary line analysis and linear regression was used to estimate the influence of planting date on wheat yield potential (Yp) by combining survey data from six cropping seasons (Fig.1). The best-fit regression model was a two-segment \u2018piecewise\u2019 model with a break point at day of year (DOY) 324, or 20 November. Before this date, every day delay in wheat planting resulted in aYploss of approximately 25\u2009kg\u2009ha\u22121d\u22121. After this point, losses approximately doubled to 51\u2009kg\u2009ha\u22121d\u22121. These results suggest thatYpincreases by 69% for fields established in early November (Yp=\u20095.4\u2009t\u2009ha\u22121) compared with those sown in late December (Yp=\u20093.2\u2009t\u2009ha\u22121). Year-to-year stability ofYpalso changes after 20 November with the standard deviation increasing by approximately 30% over earlier sowing dates, implying that system reliability diminishes considerably with later establishment. Stability is regained with very late sowing in mid-December with consistently low values across years.\nAt 5\u2009d intervals, field survey data (n=\u200911,413 production fields) and boundary line analysis were used to estimate wheat yield potential (Yp) as a function of establishment date for six consecutive production seasons (2013\u20132018 harvest years). Mean values across years are depicted in green with associated error bars representing \u00b1\u20091 standard deviation (SD) from the mean. The black line is the \u2018best-fit\u2019 piecewise regression with a break point at 20 November (DOY 324) after which declines in yield potential with sowing date delays doubles from 25\u2009kg\u2009ha\u22121d\u22121to 51\u2009kg\u2009ha\u22121d\u22121.\nSource data\nOn an area-wide basis, the MODIS-derived wheat sowing date estimates for harvest years 2003 to 2017 suggest a multi-year mean of 13 December that ranges for individual years from 5 December to 19 December with a SD\u2009\u00b1\u20094\u2009d (Fig.2). There are, however, notable geographic differences with interannual sowing date stability associated with areas that are usually planted in either early November or late December (that is, well-drained or poorly drained parts of the landscape, respectively). At the pixel level, there is also considerable spatial variability within years (SD\u2009\u00b1\u200911\u2009d) with the southwestern part of the study area considerably delayed whereas the northwest and central region are generally early. Nevertheless, in an average year, our analysis suggests that a dominant share of the wheat area (59%) in the study\u2019s AOI is sown after 1 December.\nLong-term (2003\u20132017 wheat harvest seasons) analysis of MODIS satellite imagery characterizes spatial and temporal patterns of wheat sowing dates at the scale of 250\u2009m in eastern India.

AEZ, Agroecological Zone.\nSource data\nIn the household survey conducted in a subset of six districts for the wheat harvest years of 2010 to 2015, farmers were asked about their normal wheat planting practices and, as appropriate, causes of delayed wheat sowing (that is after 15 November for the purposes of the survey). Out of 5,766 responses, wheat was sown late in 4,857 cases (84%) (Table1). Overall, the three most prominent reasons for late sowing were that the field was still occupied by the previous crop (44%), almost always rice, followed by knowledge gaps about the importance of early sowing (26%) and field waterlogging from poor drainage (21%). Disaggregating the results by survey periods shows that the share of late-sowing farmers who were not aware of the benefits of earlier sowing decreased substantially from 37% (2010\u20132012) to 14% (2013\u20132015). Conversely, cases where the field was still occupied by rice more than doubled from 28% to 61%, probably in part because of a two-week delay in the onset of monsoon rainfall in 2012.\nLandscape diagnostic surveys conducted across the broader AOI of our study for the wheat harvest year 2018 confirm the primary importance of rice management to the timing of wheat planting. Before DOY 305 (that is, 1 November, approximately 25% of the dataset), there is no apparent association between rice harvest and wheat sowing date. After 1 November, a strong linear relationship exists with each day of delay in rice harvest accounting for a 0.8\u2009d delay in wheat establishment (Fig.3). Across all rice harvest dates in 2018, the median time lag between rice harvest and wheat establishment was 15\u2009d with the highest quartile delayed by \u226523\u2009d.\nPanel surveys from the same production fields in 2017 (n=\u20095,538, each field represented by a single symbol) demonstrates the strong dependence of wheat sowing date on the harvest date of the preceding rice crop. The median time lag between rice harvest and wheat sowing is 15\u2009d. The black line is the linear regression for wheat sowing date as a function of rice harvest date; this relationship explains 65% of the total variation in wheat sowing date.\nSource data\nMost farmers in this part of India wait until the onset of pre-monsoon showers to establish rice nurseries and for heavier monsoon rains to transplant the crop into the main field23,24. As estimated by satellite data, long-term averaged harvest dates suggests that 22% of the rice area is ready for harvest in the second fortnight of December, 47% in the first fortnight of December, 24% in the second fortnight of November and the remainder in the first fortnight of November. Spatial patterns of early and late rice harvest are associated with broad differences in drainage, with low-lying parts of the landscapes harvested last and, as a general rule, planted with longer-duration rice varieties.\nFor our AOI in Bihar and adjacent districts in eastern Uttar Pradesh, wheatYpis estimated to be 3.68\u2009t\u2009ha\u22121based on contemporary long-term mean planting dates (Scenario A). Wheat or rice-based interventions that serve the purpose of advancing wheat planting are expected to result in wheatYpgains of 0.30 (Scenario B) and 0.58\u2009t\u2009ha\u22121(Scenario C), respectively, whereas a combination of both interventions (Scenario D) is anticipated to increase wheatYpby 0.84\u2009t\u2009ha\u22121over current sowing date patterns. Accordingly, the yield gap for wheat would increase from 21% at present to 36% if both rice and wheat interventions were adopted. If wheat yield gaps are closed andYpis ultimately achieved, Scenario D would result in a gain of 1.88\u2009million\u2009metric\u2009tons of annual production with an increase in farmgate value of US$421\u2009m per annum over baseline planting conditions, that is, a 69% gain in untapped production potential and revenue over Scenario A. When implemented separately, rice planting date interventions are conservatively anticipated to have twice the impact of gains associated with wheat-focused planting date interventions (that is, shortening turn-around time between rice harvest and wheat planting) on wheatYp. These results highlight the importance of managing RW rotations as a tightly coupled system rather than as separate crops (Table2).\nThe opportunity to improve wheat yield potential through sowing date adjustments is not uniform across the study area. At the administrative block level,Ypgains that exceed 1\u2009t\u2009ha\u22121over the current baseline (that is, Scenario A) are consistently observed in the northern half of the AOI, whereas responses in the southern blocks are mixed (Fig.4). Gains are lowest in the southwest corner of Bihar state where poor field drainage at the end of the rice season limits opportunities for timely wheat sowing. In much of the central corridor of the AOI, earlier wheat planting is relatively more common. Hence, the wheatYpgains in this region are less than in the north where late sowing is pervasive.\nAnticipated increases in wheatYpat the administrative block level if sowing dates are advanced by three weeks through practices that affect both the rice and wheat crops (Scenario D in Table1). The largest gains >1\u2009t\u2009ha\u22121are concentrated in the northern half of the study area, whereas modest benefits are predicted in the southwest, where very late wheat sowing is common across years (Fig.2).\nSource data\nOn the basis of current rice planting distributions in our study region23, we anticipate that advancing the rice crop calendar by up to two weeks is technically feasible and generally advantageous from a wheat productivity perspective, except for those fields that remain too wet for wheat planting throughout November. The next fundamental question is whether an earlier rice establishment strategy for boosting wheat productivity has a positive, negative or neutral effect on rice productivity and profitability. In other words, does earlier rice transplanting imply an unacceptable trade-off at the cropping system level? To address these questions, we ran the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) simulation model with historical weather data for a location in Bihar near the geographic centre of our AOI. Simulations assessed cropping system productivity, irrigation requirements and economic returns (that is, gross margin) as a function of rice transplanting date for a medium-textured soil type that is broadly representative of the study region. Gross margins were calculated using cost of cultivation data from previous studies in the region25and from plot-level summary data collected by the government of India (https:\/\/eands.dacnet.nic.in\/Plot-Level-Summary-Data.htm). Two different rice cultivars were simulated that have similar yield potential but different growth duration: (1) a long-duration inbred variety\u2014MTU7029 and (2) a medium-duration hybrid\u2014Arize6444.\nOn the basis of the analysis presented in Fig.1, a general strategy for preserving wheat yield potential is to ensure planting before 20 November, and simulation outcomes are interpreted through that lens. For the long-duration variety, rice transplanting must occur on or before 13 July, on average, to ensure timely wheat sowing. At the system level, this transplanting date also coincides with maximum simulated grain productivity and profitability (Fig.5). Before this date, there is a broad window for rice transplanting where system-level performance is relatively high and stable across dates. After this date, productivity falls markedly, with gross margins at the system level declining by more than 25% if rice transplanting is delayed by two weeks. Reductions in economic returns occur more rapidly than yield reductions because irrigation requirements for long-duration rice increase significantly with later transplanting. Compared with long-duration rice, simulation results suggest a broader transplanting window for near-optimal systems productivity with medium-duration hybrid rice. Gross margins and grain yields are very similar between 15 June and 3 August, and transplanting medium-duration rice within this window ensures that the wheat crop can be planted on time.\nSubstantial changes in the timing of wheat sowing require management innovations to the rice phase of the annual crop rotation. Dynamic simulation with the APSIM model was used to assess potential trade-offs between rice transplanting date and RW systems-level productivity for both long-duration (modern inbred) and medium-duration (hybrid) rice cultivars. Yields are calculated in rice equivalent terms and profitability estimated through gross margins; both are expressed relative to the highest mean value across all transplanting dates by rice variety combinations. Box plots show yield distributions at 7\u2009d intervals with the line within each box representing the median and the lower and upper boundaries of the box indicating the first and third quartiles, respectively. Error bars (whiskers) represent 1.5\u00d7 the interquartile range, with data points above or below this shown as outliers. Systems-level gross margin is depicted by the green line with error bars (\u00b1\u20091\u2009SD from the mean) representing interannual variation. For systems with long-duration rice, simulation results suggest that transplanting on or before 13 July (DOY 201) is essential for ensuring high yield and profitability outcomes. A broader window of opportunity exists for RW systems planting medium-duration rice, with high and stable productivity achievable through early August.\nSource data\nSimulation results are probably broadly representative of our AOI, but subregional differences in soil properties, landscape-mediated field drainage characteristics and rainfall patterns will probably influence optimal rice transplanting dates in any given production year. Anticipated advances in soil and drainage class mapping will permit a richer set of simulations that account for these differences.\nThe results of our analysis suggest that major gains in wheat productivity are achievable in the EGP if management is modified to ensure timely wheat establishment as a mechanism for climate resilience. By combining changes in rice and wheat management, greater adjustments to the annual cropping calendar are anticipated to increase wheat yield potential by an average of 0.84\u2009t\u2009ha\u22121, thereby providing greater scope for yield increase, food security and income generation in the EGP. This represents a 69% increase in the attainable wheat yield gap over a baseline estimate of 0.78\u2009t\u2009ha\u22121. If these gains are realized, they would transition our study region from being a net wheat importer to a important source of wheat for other food-insecure regions in South Asia26. This outcome aligns with the agricultural development policy ambitions established by the government of India through the National Food Security Mission and special initiatives therein, including Bringing the Green Revolution to eastern India. Transitions to timely wheat planting will probably increase system reliability by reducing interannual production variability and, crucially, there are no anticipated trade-offs with RW systems-level productivity if rice is managed in a manner to ensure timely wheat establishment. As the favourable thermal window for dry-season wheat shrinks in South Asia with progressive climate change17, timely wheat establishment will probably assume even greater importance for yield and production reliability in the EGP27,28.\nNevertheless, the challenge of scaling innovative management strategies to optimize the annual cropping calendar is not typically a simple task because many farmers must take several steps beyond simplychoosingto plant earlier to implement a new time management strategy (Table2). This is particularly true in the case of the coupled RW systems of the EGP where rice harvest date exerts strong control over the timing of wheat planting (Fig.3). Further, there is a notable spatial dimension to the early-planting opportunity, with the northern half of our study area constituting the priority area for action (Fig.4). There are several potential pathways towards effective time management of the RW cropping calendar that differ with respect to investment costs and other factors affecting feasibility and desirability of adoption. Here we briefly describe six of the more promising options that can be implemented independently or, in some cases, as complementary strategies that may collectively return gains in crop productivity and resilience beyond those estimated in this study through more radical adjustments to the cropping calendar. These promising options include:\nMany farmers currently wait for the arrival of substantial pre-monsoon rain showers before establishing rice nurseries and, thereafter, the occurrence of inundating monsoon rainfall to subsequently transplant seedlings into the main field23. This management approach reduces or even eliminates early irrigation requirements29, which is a key consideration for the many farmers in eastern India that rely on shallow tube wells and expensive-to-operate diesel pump sets. Although initial cash investment costs are reduced, these strategies also delay rice crop establishment and the timing of harvest23. Rapidly expanding rural electrification programmes may be a game changer for earlier rice establishment30, especially if less expensive energy sources are combined with reliable planting date advisories that take advantage of the increasing skill of sub-seasonal monsoon forecasts in South Asia31.\nEven with cheaper energy and robust agro-advisories, many farmers may continue to wait for the arrival of pre-monsoon rains to establish rice nurseries. In practice, this is a form of risk management that prevents rice yield reductions emanating from use of older seedlings in case the inundating rains that facilitate rice transplanting are delayed. Through social and small business enterprises, there is scope for the production and sale of \u2018staggered\u2019 nurseries that seek to provide appropriately aged seedlings to farmers to plant whenever monsoon showers commence. In many circumstances, this may accelerate planting by two or more weeks while helping to preserve rice yield potential by avoiding the use of old seedlings.\nDirectly sown rice (DSR) facilitates early rice establishment because it requires less water for establishment compared with transplanted rice and is typically sown in drained soil conditions before the onset of the monsoon32. Further, DSR matures 8\u201310\u2009d earlier than a transplanted rice crop due to the absence of transplant shock32. On the basis of long-term simulations, the optimum time for sowing DSR is within the first half of June29. Even with long-duration rice varieties, DSR sown by mid-June will be harvested by late October, leaving ample time to prepare the field and sow the wheat crop on time.\nIn this study, simulation results suggest that long-duration rice (that is, MTU7029) must be transplanted on or before 13 July (Fig.5) to ensure timely wheat planting and high levels of RW systems productivity. Results also suggest considerably more \u2018room to manoeuvre\u2019 if farmers transition to medium-duration hybrid rice (for example, Arize6444) that can be planted until early August while maintaining high yields and profitability at the systems level. These results are consistent with recent field trials conducted by the Cereal Systems Initiative for South Asia (CSISA) project and scientists from the Indian Council for Agricultural Research in Patna, Bihar.\nOn the basis of survey data for the 2018 wheat harvest, the average time gap between rice harvest and wheat planting is 15\u2009d. With traditional practices (implemented by ~45% of the farmers in our AOI with strong geographic differences), rice is hand-harvested and left in the main field to sun dry for several days before it is manually threshed. With mechanical threshing, rice can be removed from the field at the time of harvest, saving approximately 7\u2009d of drying time. Combine harvesting also provides an efficient approach to reducing turn-around time between crops but is often associated with crop residue burning with detrimental effects on health and the environment33.\nPrevailing tillage-based wheat establishment practices require repeated tillage passes that can take a week to complete, depending on soil conditions. Zero-till systems permit farmers to forgo these steps and to plant directly into untilled soil, ostensibly saving time34. On the basis of the same sample of farm households that we use for the current study, Keil et al.35estimated a 19% yield increase due to the use of zero till in wheat (equivalent to 498\u2009kg\u2009ha\u22121) but did not find systematic differences in the cropping calendar based on differences in crop establishment methods in the EGP. Further survey work is required to understand if increased awareness of the value of timely wheat establishment changes planting date practices in the EGP when technologies such as zero till are broadly available.\nEach of these adaptation pathways has its own risks, investment requirements and scaling considerations. Broadly speaking, technology adoption constraints can be related to insufficient awareness of an innovation, limited or unaffordable access, a heterogeneous range of expected benefits or institutional and policy hurdles (as an example from the South Asia region, see Krishna et al.36for a review of constraints to the diffusion of zero till). For the mechanization approaches described above, adoption in the EGP is limited by the fact that tractor ownership is not economically tenable for most smallholder farmers. In our random sample of farm households in Bihar, only 8% of households owned a tractor. Hence, for most of farmers in the area, the use of mechanization technologies to facilitate timely wheat establishment and other management goals is not only a household-level decision but rather one that is conditioned by access to service providers37.\nThe same adoption caveats hold for innovations such as medium-duration hybrid rice where there is a clear business case for the private sector along with readily observed yield and profitability gains for farmers38. From our survey data, 49% of the households in Samastipur District (Bihar) grew hybrid rice in 2013, and the share increased to 88% in 2016. In other districts, however, the cultivation of hybrid rice is entirely absent, probably reflecting a combination of tractable and binding constraints, such as poor market access or persistent flooding that favour the cultivation of long-duration rice varieties. Similar spatial dependence is evident with the spread of combine harvesting which, at present, is practised only by an estimated 10% of the rice farmers in our study area but with a strong degree of geographic heterogeneity and relatively higher levels of adoption in the western third of our study area.\nTo accelerate transitions to timely wheat establishment, three inter-dependent approaches are probably required. First, the expected yield, resilience and profitability gains of different innovations need to be contextualized and articulated at the cropping system level. Much of the applied agricultural research portfolio in South Asia retains a strong single-commodity focus, as does much of the adaptation literature that often highlights crop-specific response options for addressing progressive climate change39. Institutional barriers to cross-commodity research have long been recognized in the South Asia context, and multi-stakeholder partnerships such as the Rice\u2013Wheat Consortium and the Cereal Systems Initiative for South Asia were devised to address challenges at the cropping system level. More progress in this direction is required. Second, evidence-based opportunity targeting for specific adaptation pathways will ensure that proposed innovations are responsive to variations in biophysical, social and economic factors that, in aggregate, determine the suitability and enabling environment that permit innovations to scale in different contexts40,41. Developing and mapping household typologies offers a pragmatic way to systematize these insights42and can be used conjunctively with ex ante assessment frameworks such as the ADOPT tool to anticipate patterns of adoption and to prioritize interventions accordingly43. Lastly, it is increasingly recognized that sustainable development rarely happens through technologies or knowledge provision alone. Almost all the priority development pathways for effective cropping calendar management in the RW system entail changes to markets38,44or social organization23, and placing more emphasis on socio-technical innovation bundles to accelerate change processes is imperative45.\nIn summary, for our study region covering 2.25\u2009million\u2009ha of the RW cropping system in eastern India, current cropping calendar management erodes wheat yield potential, climate resilience and the scope for sustainable intensification. Nevertheless, transformative productivity and livelihood gains from earlier wheat planting will be possible only if adjustments are made to rice management, including earlier transplanting and the cultivation of shorter-duration crop cultivars. There are, however, notable geographic differences and multiple pathways for supporting change that must be prioritized and targeted to accelerate the process of adaptation. As the duration of the cool winter period is shortened by progressive climate change, the importance of timely wheat planting is likely to increase significantly. Steps taken to \u2018keep time\u2019 through better management of the cropping calendar will pay dividends for food security, profitability and resilience now and in the years ahead.\nThe research conducted herein complies with standards established by the Research Ethics Committee of the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center as described in policy number DDG-POL-04\u20132019.\nThe study area in eastern India is composed of Bihar state and seven adjacent districts in Uttar Pradesh state (Supplementary Fig.1), encompassing approximately 2.25\u2009million\u2009ha of the RW cropping system. The districts of Bihar fall into four major agro-climatic zones (ACZs): zone I (northern West), zone II (northern East), zone IIIA (southern East) and zone IIIB (southern West), while the districts of Uttar Pradesh fall into zone IV (Fig.1). The climate in the study\u2019s AOI is classified as humid subtropical, with distinct wet and dry seasons (Supplementary Fig.2). Rice is generally transplanted from early July to mid-August, a period that coincides with the heaviest monsoon rainfall. Wheat follows rice and is sown between early November and late December with harvest extending from late March through April. Spring wheat varieties are primary cultivated in this region during the winter period, that is, varieties that do not have big vernalization requirements.\nTo elicit information on decision-making processes for wheat planting dates, detailed household surveys were deployed using a cluster sampling approach from 40 randomly selected villages across six districts of Bihar. A second random draw was done to select farm households within each village with a total of 1,000 surveys conducted from August to October 2013. The districts were Vaishali, Samastipur and Begusarai in ACZ zone I, Lakhisarai in zone IIIA, and Bhojpur and Buxar in zone IIIB. From May to July 2016, 96% of the sample households were revisited and the same information elicited for the seasons 2013\u20132014 through 2015\u20132016. A total of 5,766 site-year observations for crop establishment and harvesting times were collected by repeated sampling from 961 farm households, spanning the six-year period 2010 through 2015. The full dataset and description of the survey instrument can be accessed via Dataverse46.\nData on wheat yields, production practices and site characteristics were collected across Bihar state and adjacent districts in Uttar Pradesh for five wheat growing seasons (2012\u20132013 to 2016\u20132017). The sampling strategy was purposive with farmers associated with the Cereal Systems Initiative for South Asia (www.csisa.org) and their neighbours targeted for the survey with a total number of 6,216 site years, withnranging from 429 to 1,074 for each year. Crop cuts were conducted at the time of harvest in early April with three 2\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009m plots within each field assessed for biomass and grain, the latter reported at 14% moisture content.\nFor the 2017\u20132018 wheat growing season, the sampling strategy and survey instrument were revised to achieve a representative sample of wheat growing farmers in the area of interest coupled with a more comprehensive set of questions47. A total of 7,648 individual fields were characterized in collaboration with the Indian Council of Agricultural Research. Sites were selected through a two-stage process that first randomly identified 30 rural villages per district and then, within each village, randomly selected seven farm households based on voting rolls. For selecting villages, a \u2018probability proportionate to size\u2019 method of random sampling was employed with the sampling frame constrained to villages with more than 30 and less than 5,000 households. In all landscape diagnostic surveys (LDSs), the largest wheat plot was characterized for site attributes (for example, field area, landscape position, soil texture class), agronomic production practices (for example, fertilizer and agro-chemical input use, planting and harvest dates, irrigation practices, crop variety, crop establishment method), socio-economic factors (for example, land tenure, household and landholdings size, marketed crop share and sale price, total income share from agriculture) and self-reported grain yield. The full dataset and description of the survey instrument can be accessed via Dataverse48. For the 2017\u20132018 data, digital soil mapping predictions for soil chemical properties (nutrient concentrations, pH, organic carbon) were also estimated for each field.\nIn addition to standard summary statistics, two additional analytical approaches were used with the LDS survey data. First, boundary line analysis was used to establish wheat yield potential (Yp) as it varies by planting date by fitting a function to the outer edge of the yield (yaxis) and sowing date (xaxis) data cloud. This approach assumes that all other productivity-influencing factors have a modest effect on yield at the boundary line such that the effect of planting date onYpis isolated49. We also assume that the highest-yielding farmers in the region are operating at or near the biological yield frontier where water, nutrients and other management factors do not limit crop performance50. The outer edge was defined by first binning each year\u2019s survey data into 5\u2009d intervals and then identifying the 90% percentile yield of the data distribution within each bin. Thereafter, piecewise linear regression was used to model a generalized boundary line for the six years of data with the \u2018Segmented\u2019 package within the R statistical computing environment (R version 4.1.2). Interannual variability ofYpwas assessed by characterizing the standard deviation of the mean for each 5\u2009d period.\nTo characterize the overall importance of contemporary wheat sowing date distributions to yield outcomes in comparison to other soil and agronomic factors, machine learning analytics (that is, Random Forest, implemented as \u2018boosted forest\u2019 in JMP Pro v14 statistical software) were used to develop predictive models for yield and to rank factors in their order of importance through recursive permutation. Because the LDS survey design changed in 2017\u20132018, two separate models were constructed.\nTotal wheat area and crop establishment dates were derived from MODIS satellite data for a 16-year period (2002 to 2017 wheat harvest years). By combining 16\u2009d composite vegetation indices from the Terra (MOD13Q1) and Aqua (MYD13Q1) satellites at 250\u2009m spatial resolution, time series estimates of Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) were analysed at 8\u2009d intervals for the entire AOI during the winter cropping cycle. Thereafter, vegetation growth functions were derived for each pixel from the EVI data using the TIMESAT software package and the Savitzky\u2013Golay filter51. Subsequently, these functions were used to estimate phenological parameters, including start of the season (that is, sowing), end of the season (that is, physiological maturity) and cropping duration.\nSatellites cannot reliably detect the early stages of crop growth, hence correction factors must be used to estimate true sowing dates. By comparing satellite EVI values with ground truth data from the LDS surveys at six different locations, we estimated that wheat EVI values reached 15% of their maximum approximately three weeks after sowing, a result consistent with Lobell et al.52. Consequently, a three-week adjustment was applied to every pixel from the date when 15% max EVI was reached to estimate the true timing of crop establishment. To estimate physiological maturity, we assessed the descending limb of the EVI growth curve and determined the date when EVI values first reached their seasonal minimum. Crop duration was calculated as the difference in days between sowing and maturity.\nAn area mask was also developed to segregate wheat pixels from other vegetation types. A multi-stage process was used for this purpose. First, maximum EVI criteria were applied to the winter cropping season based on Wardlow et al.53and Schulthess et al.54to separate intensified crops, such as wheat, from winter fallow and low-yielding pulse crops, such as lentil. Then, the seasonality of crop growth was used to remove areas with natural vegetation, such as forests. Next, known planting and harvest date ranges for wheat in the target region were used to segregate wheat from other high-yielding winter crop types such as maize and sugar cane. We verified model performance against 201 ground points that were approximately equally split between wheat and non-wheat crops and achieved an overall map accuracy of 86% for wheat versus non-wheat crop type classification.\nThe boundary line analysis method provides a data-driven approach for estimating attainable wheatYpas a function of planting date. To assess likely changes in yield potential that result from plausible planting date modifications, we applied this model first with the longer-term mean planting date for every 250\u2009m wheat pixel in our AOI (that is, satellite-derived \u2018Scenario A\u2019) and then with three different scenarios of change that reflect agronomically realistic pathways for adjusting wheat planting dates based on expert knowledge from the region. Scenarios tested include wheat-specific interventions (\u2018Scenario B\u2019), interventions that target rice (\u2018Scenario C\u2019) and interventions that influence both rice and wheat phases of the cropping cycle (\u2018Scenario D\u2019) (Table3). On the basis of the LDS survey responses from 2018 to the question \u2018if wheat is usually planted late, what is the reason?\u2019, we estimated that 11% of the fields in our AOI are too wet to plant earlier in most years, and these fields represent the lagging tail of the contemporary planting date distribution. In our scenario analysis, poor drainage is treated as a binding constraint, and all fields with mean planting dates on or after 25 December (that is, approximately 11% of the planting date distribution) are assumed to be fixed. On the basis of survey data, we also assumed that wheat will not be planted before 27 October.\nThese scenarios were used to develop a spatial opportunity assessment that characterizes wheat yield potential in our AOI as a set of values defined by a distribution of sowing dates. This represents a departure from most yield gap assessment studies that treat planting date as a single (usually optimized) attribute of the cropping system that is applied across an AOI, rather than a distribution that reflects current farmer practice or a modification thereof55. Modelled gains in wheat yield potential are further contextualized with reference to yield gaps by calculating the difference between yield potential and actual productivity levels (YG\u2009=Yp\u2212Yactual). For our purposes, we use survey data from 2018 to estimate averageYactualwithin the study region as 2.9\u2009t\u2009ha\u22121.\nIn tightly sequenced crops such as those in the RW system, planting date adjustments must be assessed at the cropping systems level from the perspective of practical feasibility (that is,can this be done?) but also to identify management strategies that optimize performance by minimizing trade-offs. To this end, APSIM v7.09 was used to simulate a range of coupled RW planting date scenarios to assess implications for aggregate crop yields, interannual yield stability, irrigation water requirements and economic productivity. Simulations were conducted for a single site in Patna, Bihar, that is situated near the centre of our broader areas of interest; variations in subregional climate and soil factors are not considered in our analysis.\nAPSIM is a flexible modelling framework that enables a variety of sub-models of the soil\u2013plant\u2013atmosphere system to be linked to simulate agricultural system performance56. Sub-models include crop-specific dynamic growth models and different options for representing soil processes such as water fluxes and the N balance. In this study, we use the WHEAT module57for simulating wheat and the ORYZA module58for rice. APSIM was calibrated with crop growth and soil data from an Indian Council of Agricultural Research experimental site in Patna, Bihar. The most common crop cultivars grown in the region (MTU7029 and Arize6444 for rice, PBW343 for wheat) and silt loam soil characteristics were used for model parameterization. This soil type is broadly representative of many of the alluvial soils in the EGP with respect to physical and chemical properties59. Depth-wise soil physical properties are presented in Supplementary Table2. Temporal changes in hydraulic conductivity are used to capture the shift between lowly permeable \u2018puddled\u2019 soil during the rice season to dry-land soils with higher rates of internal drainage during the wheat season. APSIM performs well in simulating RW systems under contrasting production environments across Asia29,60, and these prior studies provide the basis for its application in our work without additional model verification.\nThe calibrated model was used to evaluate the performance of the RW rotation under different rice transplanting dates starting from June to mid-September at 7\u2009d increments with both longer-duration (MTU7029, 155\u2009d\u2014improved inbred) and medium-duration (Arize6444, 135\u2009d\u2014hybrid) rice cultivars. APSIM genetic coefficients for both rice varieties are presented in Supplementary Table3. Simulations were driven with 43 years (1970\u20132013) of daily weather data with management factors set to reflect best agronomic practices for seedling age, planting densities and fertilization (Balwinder-Singh et al.29). The rice crop was irrigated daily as needed to maintain continuous ponding (flood depth of 50\u2009mm) for the first two weeks after transplanting. Thereafter, the crop was irrigated 3\u2009d after disappearance of ponded water. The wheat cultivar PBW343 was sown 15\u2009d after rice harvesting and was irrigated whenever soil water in the top 60\u2009cm of the soil profile decreased to 50% of plant available water content (50% soil water deficit). Wheat genetic coefficients are presented in Supplementary Table4. By applying full irrigation and best agronomic management practices, soil and water limitations to crop growth are minimized in our simulations.\nFurther information on research design is available in theNature Research Reporting Summarylinked to this article.\nSource data files provide the raw data used to produce all figures.

Here a two-step CO2electrolyser system was developed to produce a highly concentrated acetate stream with a 57% carbon selectivity (CO2to acetate), allowing its direct use for the heterotrophic cultivation of yeast, mushroom-producing fungus and a photosynthetic green alga, in the dark without inputs from biological photosynthesis. An evaluation of nine crop plants found that carbon from exogenously supplied acetate incorporates into biomass through major metabolic pathways. Coupling this approach to existing photovoltaic systems could increase solar-to-food energy conversion efficiency by about fourfold over biological photosynthesis, reducing the solar footprint required. This technology allows for a reimagination of how food can be produced in controlled environments.\nFood demand is growing globally, but food production is ultimately constrained by the energy conversion efficiency of photosynthesis. Most crop plants can convert sunlight and CO2into plant biomass at an energy conversion efficiency of only ~1% or less1. Large tracts of land are thus required for crop cultivation to capture the requisite solar energy to provide food for humanity. Recent breeding and genetic engineering efforts to increase photosynthetic efficiency have yielded only select gains in a limited number of food crops2,3,4. Increasing the energy efficiency of food production (solar-to-biomass conversion) would allow for more food to be produced using less resources.\nArtificial photosynthesis seeks to overcome the limitations of biological photosynthesis, including low efficiency of solar energy capture and poor carbon dioxide reduction, and could provide an alternative route for food production. Recent studies have demonstrated systems that convert CO2and H2O into reduced species, such as CO, formate, methanol and H2, through electrolysis processes. CO2, CO and H2can be upgraded to fuels and chemicals through gas-phase fermentation by select bacteria5,6,7; however, gas\u2013liquid mass transfer limits the volumetric efficiency and results in uneconomic fermentation systems. The use of formate or methanol as a carbon source for fermentation is limited because formaldehyde, a toxic intermediate, is formed during biological metabolism of these substrates8,9,10. To date, electrochemically derived substrates cannot support the growth of most food-producing organisms11. However, acetate is a soluble, two-carbon substrate that can be electrochemically produced12and is more readily metabolized by a broad range of organisms. The use of acetate produced from CO2electrolysis to cultivate food-producing organisms could allow food production independent of biological photosynthesis but has not yet been demonstrated.\nHere we describe the development of a hybrid inorganic\u2013biological system for food production. A two-step electrochemical process converts CO2to acetate, which serves as a carbon and energy source for algae, yeast, mushroom-producing fungus, lettuce, rice, cowpea, green pea, canola, tomato, pepper, tobacco andArabidopsis(A. thaliana) (Fig.1). Coupling this system of carbon fixation to photovoltaics offers an alternative, more energy-efficient approach to food production.\na, CO2electrolysis uses electricity (generated by photovoltaics) to convert CO2and H2O into O2and acetate. This process was optimized to produce an effluent output ideal for supporting the growth of food-producing organisms.b,Chlamydomonas,Saccharomyces, mushroom-producing fungus and a variety of vascular crop plants were grown using the electrolyser-produced effluent.c, The organisms grown using the electrolyser-produced effluent serve as food or food products. This system is capable of making food independent of photosynthesis, using CO2, H2O and solar energy.\nTo provide a carbon and energy source independent of biological photosynthesis that can sustain the growth of food-producing organisms, we developed an electrocatalytic process to produce acetate (as either sodium or potassium acetate depending on the electrolyte salt) from CO2. Acetate produced directly from electrochemical CO2reduction using a copper catalyst has a less than 15% carbon selectivity, which is defined as the amount of carbon in the end product(s) divided by the total amount of carbon reduced in the system13,14,15,16. However, recent studies on CO reduction have demonstrated that acetate can be produced at industrially relevant reaction rates with a carbon selectivity of greater than 50% using a nanostructured copper catalyst12,17,18. To achieve maximum selectivity and production of acetate from a direct CO2feed, a two-step electrolyser system was demonstrated to convert CO2to CO and then CO to acetate through a tandem process (Fig.2aand Extended Data Fig.1a). More specifically, CO2is fed to the cathode of the first electrolyser, which utilizes a commercial silver catalyst supported on a gas diffusion layer (that is, a carbon paper) and produces a gaseous product stream containing CO, H2and trace CO2. The gas diffusion electrode improves the gaseous CO2transport to the electrocatalyst, achieving higher currents towards CO2reduction products compared with dissolved CO2in a typical batch reactor16,19,20,21. A solution of 1\u2009M KHCO3in deionized water was used as the electrolyte on the anode side (that is, anolyte) for the CO2electrolyser and recirculated through the anode compartment to maintain the ionic conductivity. The presence of an aqueous electrolyte has been shown to reduce the total cell potential for anion exchange membrane-based CO2electrolysers13,22. An IrO2anode was utilized for CO2reduction, due to its stability in neutral pH. The gas product stream was then fed to the cathode chamber of the CO electrolyser, which contains a commercial copper catalyst for CO reduction, 1\u2009M KOH as the anolyte and a NiFeOxanode. This design is similar to a tandem system previously reported by Romero Cuellar et al.23. By maximizing the conversion of the first and second electrolysers, as well as specifically targeting acetate over other multi-carbon products, this system was able to achieve a single-pass conversion of CO2to acetate of 25%, a large improvement over the <1% conversion previously reported (Supplementary Table1). Effluents, the liquid products of electrolysis containing acetate and other by-products (Extended Data Fig.1c,d), were evaluated as carbon and energy sources for the cultivation of food-producing organisms. Early experiments found that effluents with an acetate-to-electrolyte ratio below 0.4 did not support the growth of algae (Supplementary Note). Maximizing the ratio of acetate to electrolyte was therefore crucial for integrating these carbon products with biological food production.\na\u2013f, Early (a\u2013c) and optimized (d\u2013f) two-step electrolysis systems for the production of acetate. Panelsaanddshow overviews of the schematics. Effluent containing acetate is collected in the anode compartment of the CO electrolyser. Inbande, carbon selectivities towards specific products and area-normalized production rates are shown. Acetate, propionate,n-propanol and ethanol were collected and quantified in effluent, ethylene was quantified continuously over the course of the experiment and the average value is presented. Incandf, the electrolyser voltage stabilities of CO2electrolyser (gold) and CO electrolyser (silver) are shown. CO2electrolyser operated for the entire experiment using 1\u2009M KHCO3electrolyte, a silver nanoparticle cathode and an iridium oxide anode. CO electrolyser operation began after 30 minutes using 1\u2009M KOH electrolyte, a copper nanoparticle cathode and a nickel iron oxide anode. CO2flow was held constant at 7 ml min\u22121. Oscillations in potential were caused by fluctuations in the back-pressure controller. Panelcshows a voltage increase over the time observed. Fresh KOH was fed to recover the electrolyser voltage (arrow) to determine whether the electrolyser voltage increase was due to the acidification of electrolyte. The CO2scrubber contained 5\u2009M NaOH to capture residual CO2.\nOperating parameters of the tandem CO2electrolysis system were identified that maximized the conversion of CO2feed to acetate. For the production of CO, the operating current density of the CO2electrolyser was 100\u2009mA\u2009cm\u22122at an inlet flow rate of 7\u2009ml\u2009min\u22121CO2, which maximized CO2conversion to CO at 43% and maintained a high level of performance (Extended Data Fig.1e\u2013h). For the CO electrolyser, the operating current density of 150\u2009mA\u2009cm\u22122was selected to achieve greater than 80% conversion of electrochemically produced CO into C2+products over the entire duration of electrolysis (Extended Data Fig.1g,h). Initial experiments found that trace amounts of CO2negatively affected acetate selectivity in the CO electrolyser and led to a rapid increase in CO electrolyser voltage (Fig.2b,c). When a 5\u2009M NaOH scrubber was introduced between the two electrolysers, acetate selectivity was increased by over a factor of 3, because the scrubber prevented the unreacted CO2from the first reactor from reaching the CO electrolyser (Fig.2d\u2013fand Extended Data Fig.1b). Overall, 57% of reacted CO2formed acetate at a production rate of 0.7\u2009g\u2009d\u22121cm\u22122, representing the highest conversion of CO2feed to acetate reported to date (Fig.2eand Supplementary Table1).\nThe tandem CO2electrolysis system operated stably while producing effluent with high acetate-to-electrolyte ratios. The electrolyser voltage for the CO2electrolyser remained constant near 2.95\u2009V (Fig.2f) with less than a 60\u2009mV increase in voltage over the six-hour experiment. The CO reactor operated at 2.22\u2009V with a voltage increase of 160\u2009mV over the course of the experiment (Fig.2f), which is attributed to the pH shift in the electrolyte from 13.7 to 13.4 as acetate accumulated. Both catholyte (through the use of a cold-trap) and anolyte were collected and analysed for product quantification. As >99% of the produced acetate was collected in the anolyte, this was the primary effluent used for food production. The final effluent produced contained 0.75\u2009M acetate and an acetate-to-electrolyte salt ratio of 0.75, representing the highest recorded acetate-to-electrolyte product stream to date (Supplementary Table1).\nWe used the photosynthetic algaChlamydomonas(C. reinhardtii), which can grow heterotrophically on acetate in the dark, as a model to determine whether the improved effluent produced by the electrolysers could support the growth of food-producing organisms.Chlamydomonasis added to processed foods for protein fortification and has been shown to have a positive effect on human gastrointestinal health24,25,26,27,28. Algae can produce large amounts of starch, protein and oil.Chlamydomonasgrown heterotrophically can produce over 1\u2009g of starch, 1\u2009g of protein and 0.7\u2009g of lipid per litre per day28,29. To evaluate effluent as a carbon source,Chlamydomonaswas grown heterotrophically in the dark with effluent diluted to match the acetate concentration of a typical liquid heterotrophic growth medium (17.5\u2009mM acetate in Tris\u2013acetate\u2013phosphate (TAP) medium) and adjusted to pH 7.2. Effluent-derived acetate served as the sole carbon and energy source. Effluents from different electrolysis experiments used throughout this manuscript are noted by the acetate-to-electrolyte concentration ratio (acetate concentration: electrolyte concentration), with more details provided in Supplementary Table2. All effluents evaluated with an acetate-to-electrolyte ratio of greater than 0.4\u2009M acetate: 1\u2009M electrolyte enabled the growth ofChlamydomonasin the dark (Supplementary Note, Fig.3a\u2013c, Extended Data Figs.2and3a\u2013e, and Supplementary Table3).\na, Image ofChlamydomonascultures taken after four days of growth in darkness; the cultures were grown with effluent (0.691\u2009M acetate: 1\u2009M KOH) or with no effluent.b,c, Growth ofChlamydomonascultures grown in the dark, shaking, at 30\u2009\u00b0C, with effluent (0.75\u2009M acetate: 1\u2009M KOH), with acetate (control) or with neither (no acetate or effluent).

Incande, two-tailed unpairedt-tests showed no significant difference betweenChlamydomonasgrowth in acetate and in effluent media (P=\u20090.1045) and no significant difference betweenSaccharomycesgrowth in glucose and in effluent media (P=\u20090.1857). NS, not significant.f, Images of pearl oyster, enokitake, elm oyster and blue oyster mushroom mycelium from colonization of a solid vermiculite substrate soaked with YPD media containing simulated effluent in place of glucose (0.0691\u2009M acetate: 1\u2009M KOH) to reach 0.5% (w\/w) acetate as the primary carbon and energy source. The images were taken 24 days after inoculation. Scale bar, 20\u2009mm.g, Growth seven days after inoculation of pearl oyster mushroom mycelium (white) on solid vermiculite substrate soaked with liquid YPD media containing simulated effluent in place of glucose (0.0691\u2009M acetate: 1\u2009M KOH) as indicated. Scale bar, 20\u2009mm.\nChlamydomonasgrown on an effluent with an improved acetate-to-electrolyte salt ratio (0.75\u2009M acetate: 1\u2009M KOH) had a yield of 0.28\u2009g algae per g acetate (Fig.3b,c), which is comparable to yields reported from non-effluent medias29.Chlamydomonasutilized over 99% of acetate in the media (Extended Data Fig.3f). No products of photosynthesis (such as carbohydrates) or ancient photosynthesis (such as petroleum-derived carbon sources) were required for growth. Hence, our cultivation of a photosynthetic organism using carbon fixed through electrolysis is fully decoupled from biological photosynthesis.\nThe nutritional yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiaeis used as a food source in single-cell protein spreads and in the production of breads and fermented beverages30,31. Yeast is a heterotrophic organism most commonly grown with glucose derived from photosynthesis (that is, starch-derived) as a carbon and energy source. To cultivate yeast without inputs derived from photosynthesis, we replaced the primary carbon source, glucose, in the yeast\u2013peptone\u2013dextrose (YPD) media with effluent from electrolysis. All media were adjusted to pH 6.0. Electrolyser-produced effluent (0.75\u2009M acetate: 1\u2009M KOH) supported the growth of yeast, enabling a yield of 0.19\u2009g yeast biomass per g acetate as well as a ninefold increase in OD600 and a twofold increase in dry weight compared with yeast grown without acetate or glucose (Fig.3d,e). After successfully decoupling the production of yeast from photosynthesis-derived carbon and energy, we sought to achieve the same results in mushroom-producing fungus. Mushrooms are widely consumed as a food, and fungal mycelium has emerged as a high-protein meat analogue32. These fungi are typically cultivated on solid substrates composed of photosynthesis-derived carbohydrates, such as cellulose or rice flour. To cultivate fungal mycelium without these carbohydrates, we developed a solid-state fermentation approach that used effluent as the primary carbon and energy source. Due to the amounts needed, simulated effluents were used here, made up of the same components as electrolyser-produced effluents. Simulated effluent (0.691\u2009M acetate: 1\u2009M KOH) was added to YPD media without glucose to reach 0.5% (w\/w) acetate; this substrate supported the growth of pearl oyster, blue oyster, elm oyster, coral tooth and enokitake mycelium (Fig.3fand Extended Data Fig.3g\u2013i). The majority of the substrate was fully colonized by all five species, indicating that effluent can serve as a carbon source for the cultivation of a variety of mushroom-producing fungus mycelia. Higher levels of effluent inhibited mycelium growth (Fig.3gand Extended Data Fig.3g), probably due to the higher levels of effluent by-products, specifically propionate, which is used as an antifungal food preservative33. The successful growth of mycelium indicates the ability to produce mycelium-based foods and potentially mushrooms independent of carbon and energy derived from photosynthesis.\nTo further evaluate whether carbon fixed through CO2electrolysis could be used to produce plant-based food, we examined the potential of acetate to serve as a carbon and energy source for crops. We tracked acetate incorporation into plant biomass using heavy-isotope13C-acetate labelled at both carbon atoms to evaluate whether exogenous acetate can be metabolized by crops. Previous acetate incorporation studies have primarily focused on metabolites involved in lipid biosynthesis in only a few plant species. In these studies, acetate was used in low concentrations as a tracer, not as a carbon source (Supplementary Table4)34,35,36. To investigate acetate utilization as a carbon source, we grew undifferentiated lettuce tissue (callus) (to avoid the carbon and energy stored in seeds) in the dark in liquid media containing effluent (0.691\u2009M acetate: 1\u2009M KOH) and added in13C-acetate to enable tracking of carbon incorporation. Calli showed extensive13C-labelling in multiple pathways, confirming that lettuce tissue metabolizes acetate as a carbon and energy source (Fig.4a). Labelling of citrate\/isocitrate, succinate, \u03b1-ketoglutarate and malate indicated that exogenous acetate was converted to biologically active acetyl-CoA and entered the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) cycle to produce energy (GTP, NADH and FADH2) (Fig.4a). Amino acids were also labelled with13C, indicating that carbon from acetate can be used to build proteins. Products and intermediates of gluconeogenesis were also labelled, indicating that carbon from acetate can be used for carbohydrate biosynthesis (Fig.4aand Extended Data Fig.4). Carbon incorporation of13C-acetate into amino acids and sugars through the TCA cycle, glycolysis and gluconeogenesis provides strong evidence that exogenous acetate can be readily incorporated into the bulk biomass of lettuce tissue grown in dark conditions and could be a carbon and energy source for other crops.\na, Heat maps showing the log2fold enrichment of13C between treated and untreated whole lettuce plants and lettuce callus (undifferentiated lettuce). Whole lettuce plants were grown in the light and treated with no acetate or with13C-acetate (n=\u20093; each replicate was a mixture of tissue from ten plants). Lettuce callus was grown in the dark and treated with electrolyser-produced effluent (0.691\u2009M acetate: 1\u2009M KOH) (n=\u20094) and13C-acetate (n=\u20093). A variety of crop species were treated with13C-acetate, and incorporation was measured. 2\/3-PG, 2\/3-phosphoglycerate. Representative no-acetate control replicates for whole lettuce plant, lettuce callus, cowpea andArabidopsisare included for comparison. There was broad13C incorporation into crop metabolism, indicating that exogenously supplied acetate can be used for energy and biomass production in these plants.b, Schematic of exogenous acetate metabolism by a typical plant cell.c,13C incorporation into iso\/citrate and malate at multiple carbon positions in whole lettuce plants. We calculated the ratio of iso\/citrate and malate molecules that were detected with13C incorporation compared with12C.M+Xdenotes the number of labelled carbons in the molecule. The error bars represent the standard deviation between the biological replicates (n=\u20093).\nTo test acetate uptake and utilization by whole plants, we grew lettuce plants in the light with13C-acetate added to the plant growth agar medium at 2\u2009mM. In vegetative leaf tissue, we observed that amino acids, sugars and intermediates from the TCA cycle, glycolysis and gluconeogenesis were labelled with13C at multiple carbon positions (Fig.4a\u2013c). Finding labelled metabolites in leaf tissue indicates that carbon from acetate assimilated by the roots can be distributed throughout the plant. In addition to lettuce, we discovered that acetate can be incorporated into a broad variety of crops. Rice, green pea, jalape\u00f1o pepper, canola, tomato, cowpea, tobacco andArabidopsisseedlings grown in the light on solid agar containing13C-acetate all showed similar13C-labelling of amino acids, carbohydrates and TCA cycle intermediates (Fig.4aand Extended Data Fig.5) as was observed in lettuce and lettuce callus. This metabolite labelling pattern suggests a conserved mechanism of acetate utilization that exists across diverse plant species.\nLettuce seeds germinated normally on all concentrations of acetate evaluated (up to 10\u2009mM) (Extended Data Fig.6a,b). However, plant growth was largely inhibited by acetate at concentrations that would have measurably increased plant biomass, although some growth parameters such as roots showed increased growth (Extended Data Figs.6and7). Lettuce plants grown with electrolyser-produced effluent (0.691\u2009M acetate: 1\u2009M KOH or 0.648\u2009M acetate: 1\u2009M KHCO3) added to reach a final media concentration of 1.0\u2009mM acetate did not show additional growth inhibition in plant weight or leaf number from secondary electrolysis products (Extended Data Fig.7b,d). Plant tolerance and consumption of acetate as a heterotrophic energy source will need to be increased to fully decouple plants from biological photosynthesis. Together, these analyses explore acetate as a heterotrophic carbon source for crops and illustrate that many crop species can process acetate into a usable biological form and incorporate it into major energy-production cycles through TCA and biomass in the form of sugars and amino acids.\nWe demonstrated a hybrid inorganic\u2013biological system that can produce food from carbon dioxide and electricity, independent of biological photosynthesis. CO2electrolysis for acetate production was significantly improved for the purpose of biological integration. Using a two-step process, we achieved electrochemical reduction of CO2to acetate with a 57% carbon selectivity towards acetate, the highest published value to date. The electrolysis system was further engineered to produce improved effluents with acetate-to-electrolyte salt ratios as high as 0.75, well above the ratio determined necessary to support biological growth. Electrochemically derived acetate was incorporated into a diverse variety of organisms grown for food, including algae, fungi and crop plants. This includes the cultivation of a photosynthetic organism,Chlamydomonas, utilizing carbon fixed through electrolysis, independent of biological photosynthesis.13C-labelling experiments showed that a broad range of crops can utilize exogenous acetate for energy and biomass production, suggesting that acetate has the capacity to support crop growth with further optimization.\nBy powering electrolysis with photovoltaics, the conversion of sunlight and CO2to food in our system (photovoltaics to electrolysis to acetate to yeast) is almost 18 times more solar-to-biomass energy-conversion-efficient than typical food production, which relies on biological photosynthesis (photosynthesis to glucose to yeast) (Extended Data Fig.8). For algae production, our process (photovoltaics to electrolysis to acetate to algae) is almost four times more solar-to-biomass energy-conversion-efficient than biological photosynthesis of crop plants (photosynthesis to crop plants) and is equivalent to or higher than the instantaneous energy efficiency of outdoor algae production37(Fig.5and Extended Data Fig.8). There is potential for continued improvement of the system through advances in photovoltaics, electrolysis and acetate utilization in food-producing organisms. Our approach to food production is ideally suited for applications where high energy efficiencies and low physical space usage are desired, such as on space flight missions or in controlled environments on Earth. Widespread adoption of this approach in conjunction with readily available solar energy could allow for the production of more food or animal feed for a given solar footprint, which will help meet the rising demand for food without the expansion of agricultural lands.\nSankey diagrams of solar energy to plant- and algae-based food production compare the efficiencies of artificial and biological photosynthesis. Losses during energy conversion from sunlight (100% solar energy) to food are represented by arrows; the width of each arrow is proportional to the energy lost, and the percentage of the total energy lost at each step is indicated. The green arrows indicate the solar energy that can be found in biomass grown from artificial and biological photosynthesis; the width of each arrow is proportional to the energy, and the percentage of the total solar energy found in the biomass is indicated. The values for biological photosynthesis are from Zhu et al.57. For artificial photosynthesis, the values for electrochemical CO2reduction to acetate and heterotrophic cultivation on acetate were determined in this work. The value for photovoltaic losses is based on a commercially available silicon solar cell49,50.\nFor the CO2reduction electrodes, commercial silver (Ag) catalysts (nanopowder with <100\u2009nm particle size, 99.5%) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Catalyst ink was prepared by suspending 100\u2009mg of Ag nanopowder in 20\u2009ml of 2:1 (v:v) isopropanol\/deionized water. The suspension was sonicated for five minutes to allow complete dispersion of Ag particles. Afterwards, Sustanion XA-9 ionomer (5% (w\/w) in ethanol, Dioxide Materials) was added until the ionomer reached 10% (w\/w) in solution (metal basis). The resulting mixture was further sonicated for an additional 30 minutes to allow complete dispersion. To prepare the electrodes, a 25\u2009cm2piece of Sigracet 39BB gas carbon paper (Fuel Cell Store), used as a gas diffusion layer, was heated on a hot plate to 100\u2009\u00b0C. Catalyst ink was airbrushed onto the carbon paper until a loading of 1.4\u2009mg\u2009cm\u22122was reached. The electrode was dried at 70\u2009\u00b0C overnight to ensure the complete evaporation of solvents.\nFor the CO reduction electrodes, commercial copper (Cu) catalyst (nanopowder with 25\u2009nm particle size (TEM)) was purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Catalyst ink was prepared by suspending 100\u2009mg of Cu nanopowder in 20\u2009ml of 2:1 (v:v) isopropanol\/deionized water. The suspension was sonicated for five minutes to allow complete dispersion of Cu particles. Afterwards, Sustanion XA-9 ionomer (5% (w\/w) in ethanol, Dioxide Materials) was added until the ionomer reached 20% (w\/w) in solution (metal basis). The resulting mixture was further sonicated for an additional 30 minutes to allow complete dispersion. To prepare the electrodes, a 5\u2009cm2piece of Sigracet 39BB carbon paper (Fuel Cell Store) was heated on a hot plate to 100\u2009\u00b0C. Catalyst ink was drop-casted onto the carbon paper until a loading of 2.0\u2009mg\u2009cm\u22122was reached. The electrode was dried at 70\u2009\u00b0C overnight to ensure the complete evaporation of solvents.\nFor experiments using 1\u2009M KHCO3, IrO2catalysts were prepared via a previously reported method38. In a typical preparation, titanium felt (Fuel Cell Store) was degreased using acetone and etched in boiling 0.5\u2009M oxalic acid (98%, Sigma Aldrich). The titanium felt was then dip-coated in a solution of 10\u2009ml of isopropanol, 10\u2009vol% concentrated HCl (ACS reagent, Sigma Aldrich), containing 30\u2009mg dissolved IrCl3\u00b7xH2O (99.8%, Alfa Aesar). This was followed by drying at 100\u2009\u00b0C for ten minutes and calcination at 500\u2009\u00b0C for ten minutes. This procedure was repeated until a loading of 3\u2009mg\u2009cm\u22122was achieved.\nFor experiments conducted in alkaline conditions, NiFeOxanodes prepared by a previously reported method39were used. In a typical preparation, Ni foam (>99.99%, MTI Corporation) was sonicated in a 5\u2009M HCl solution for 30 minutes to remove the NiOxlayer on the surface. The foam was then rinsed using deionized water and ethanol and dried in air. Electrodeposition was carried out in a standard three-electrode electrochemical reactor containing the nickel foam as the working electrode, a platinum wire counter electrode and a Ag\/AgCl (Pine Research) reference electrode. The electrolyte bath contained 3\u2009mM Ni(NO3)2\u00b76H2O and 3\u2009mM Fe(NO3)3\u00b79H2O. A constant potential of \u22121.0\u2009V versus Ag\/AgCl was applied for 300 seconds. The electrode was then removed and rinsed with ethanol and deionized water, followed by drying overnight at 70\u2009\u00b0C to fully remove solvents. A fresh cathode was used for each experiment, whereas the anodes were reused multiple times.\nBoth the CO2and CO electrolysers were constructed as 5\u2009cm2membrane electrode assemblies with serpentine flow patterns. The cathode end plates and the CO2electrolyser anode end plate were gold-plated stainless steel. The CO electrolyser anode end plate was not gold coated, as stainless steel is stable in alkaline conditions. The CO2gas flow rate into the electrolysers was controlled via a Brooks GF040 and held at 7\u2009ml min\u22121for the two-step experiments. The back pressure was controlled using a back-pressure controller (Cole-Palmer). The anolyte flow rates for both electrolysers were controlled via a peristaltic pump, with flow rates ranging between 0.5 and 1\u2009ml\u2009min\u22121. A cold trap chilled using ice was placed between the gas outlet stream of the CO electrolyser and the back-pressure controller to capture any vaporized liquid products that might exit through the gas stream.\nFor the CO2electrolyser, the Ag cathode and the IrO2anode were pressed into a Sustanion 37-50 Anion Exchange Membrane (Dioxide Materials) at 20\u2009lb-in torque. Laser-cut Teflon (McMaster Carr) was used as a gasket to ensure that the electrolyser was gas-tight. 1\u2009M KHCO3was used as the anolyte for all CO2reduction experiments. A constant current was applied using a power source (National Instruments). For the CO electrolyser, the Cu cathode and the IrO2or NiFeOxanode were pressed against an FAA-3-50 anion exchange membrane (Fumatech) at 20\u2009lb-in torque. 1\u2009M KHCO3or 2\u2009M KOH was recirculated through the anode chamber. Liquid products were accumulated in the anolyte of the CO electrolyser until a target concentration was reached. The quantification of liquid products was conducted at the end of the experiment. For the CO electrolyser, the applied current was controlled using an Autolab PG128N potentiostat (Metrohm).\nGas products were quantified using a Multiple Gas Analyzer No. 5 gas chromatography system (SRI Instruments) equipped with a HaySep D and Molsieve 5\u2009A column connected to a thermal conductivity detector. All gas products were quantified using the thermal conductivity detector data. Liquid products were quantified using a Bruker AVIII 600\u2009MHz NMR spectrometer. Typically, 20 to 100\u2009\u03bcl of collected electrolyte exiting the reactor was diluted to 500\u2009\u03bcl, and then 100\u2009\u03bcl D2O containing 20\u2009ppm (m\/m) dimethyl sulfoxide (\u226599.9%, Alfa Aesar) was added. One-dimensional1H spectrum was measured with water suppression using a pre-saturation method.\nEffluents containing all liquid products were used for the growth of food-producing organisms. Electrolyser-produced effluents were used when possible, but in some cases simulated effluents of the same makeup were used.\nChlamydomonas reinhardtii(strain 21gr+, CC-1690 from the Chlamydomonas Resource Center) was cultivated on TAP media40where the source of acetate was a commercial supplier (Sigma 64-19-7), simulated effluent, electrolyser-produced effluent or none at all. When effluent (electrolyser produced or simulated) was the acetate source, it was added until the desired final acetate concentration was reached (17.5\u2009mM). Ethanol (Koptec 64-17-5), propionic acid (Sigma 79-09-4) andn-propanol (Sigma 71-23-8) were added as indicated in Supplementary Table3. All media were adjusted to pH 7.2 with 5\u2009M HCl. Effluents and media concentrations are shown in Supplementary Tables2and3.\nChlamydomonaswas grown in 50\u2009ml of media in 250\u2009ml flasks in the dark. The flasks were stationary at 22\u2009\u00b0C except for the experiment using 0.75\u2009M acetate: 1\u2009M KOH (data in Fig.3b,c), where the flasks were at 30\u2009\u00b0C with a shaking speed of 150 r.p.m.29. Aliquots were taken in a darkened biosafety cabinet and used for OD measurements at wavelength 750\u2009nm (QuickDrop Spectrophotometer, Molecular Devices), chlorophyll extraction and quantification41, and cell counts using a haemocytometer or the Bio-Rad TC20 Automated Cell Counter. For dry cell weights, the entire culture was centrifuged, washed two times with deionized water to remove residual salts, dried overnight at 100\u2009\u00b0C and then weighed. Images were taken with a Nikon 7500 DSLR camera.\nSaccharomyces cerevisiaewas cultured in a base medium of yeast extract (10\u2009g\u2009l\u22121) and peptone (20\u2009g\u2009l\u22121) with glucose, effluent or no additional primary carbon source42. Standardized comparisons of acetate and glucose were made on the basis of energy content, and a variety of glucose and effluent concentrations were tested, as shown in Supplementary Table5. The highest concentration is based on 2% sodium acetate42. Media with a carbon source with the energetic equivalent of 53.36\u2009kJ\u2009l\u22121(0.061\u2009M glucose or 0.019\u2009M acetate) were determined to be the most efficient and thus were used in the yeast experiments shown in Fig.3d,e. All media were adjusted to pH 6.0 with 5\u2009M HCl. Cells were grown in 5\u2009ml of media in culture tubes at 30\u2009\u00b0C and 251 r.p.m. Growth was monitored by measuring OD at 600\u2009nm and dry cell weight at 96 hours. For dry weights, the pellet was washed with deionized water to remove residual salts, dried overnight at 100\u2009\u00b0C and then weighed. Effluents and media concentrations are shown in Supplementary Tables2and3.\nFor the cultivation experiments with mushroom-producing fungi, the following five species were used: pearl oyster (Pleurotus ostreatus), elm oyster (Hypsizygus ulmarius), blue oyster (Pleurotus ostreatusvar. columbinus), enokitake (Flammulina velutipes) and coral tooth (Hericium coralloides). The strains were purchased from liquidfungi.com and maintained on a liquid medium of glucose, yeast extract and peptone. Fungal mycelia were grown in a solid-state fermentation approach that roughly followed the PF-Tek methodology43; however, the carbon sources typically added, such as starch (rice flour), peat moss and coconut fibre, were omitted. A solid substrate of fine-grade vermiculite (30\u2009g) was mixed with gypsum (0.5\u2009g) and added to a 10\u2009oz wide-mouth mason jar (Kamota). Liquid growth media (90\u2009ml) were added to each jar, which soaked into the vermiculite. Media composition was the same as the maintenance media except that the carbon source was glucose (20\u2009g\u2009l\u22121), acetate (as indicated), effluent (as indicated), no carbon source or a combination of these. Media pH was adjusted to 6.0 with HCl. The jars were closed with lids with four drilled holes (12.7\u2009mm in diameter) covered with a synthetic filter disk (0.3\u2009\u00b5m pore size) to allow gas exchange. The jars were autoclaved for 45 minutes at 121\u2009\u00b0C. Liquid mycelium cultures were centrifuged, washed with sterilized media, resuspended and then used to inoculate the sterilized jars.\nThe following nine plants were used: lettuce (Lactuca sativaL. cv. \u2018Black Seeded Simpson\u2019), rice (Oryza sativassp.japonicacv. \u2018Kitaake\u2019), green pea (Pisum sativum), tomato (Solanum lycopersicumcv. \u2018Micro-Tom\u2019), jalape\u00f1o pepper (Capsicum annuumcv. \u2018Jalape\u00f1o\u2019), canola (Brassica napus), cowpea (Vigna unguiculataL. cv. CB46), thale cress (A. thalianavar. \u2018Columbia\u2019) and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacumcv.Xanthi).\nPlants were cultivated on 50\u2009ml of basal medium of 1\/2 Murashige and Skoog salts44(Caisson Labs) and Gamborg\u2019s vitamins45(Phytotech Labs), unless otherwise noted. Solid media were made with 0.7% in vitro growth-grade agarose (Caisson Labs). The following were added as indicated: sucrose (2%), acetic acid,13C2-acetate (Sigma Aldrich) or electrolyser-produced effluent. All media were adjusted to pH 5.8 using 1\u2009M KOH or HCl. The plants were grown in 16:8-hour light\u2013dark cycles under fluorescent lighting (100\u2009\u00b5mol\u2009m\u22122s\u22121) at 22\u2009\u00b0C, unless otherwise noted.\nLettuce was germinated in soil for 11 days. The plants were clipped at the base of the stem and were further trimmed so that all lettuce stems were the same length for the start of the experiment. Each plant was transferred to an 8\u2009ml glass vial containing deionized water with acetate dissolved at various concentrations (nine plantlets per treatment: 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.6, 1, 3, 6 and 10\u2009mM acetate). After 29 days, the plantlets were imaged (using a Nikon 7500 DSLR with an AF-S VR Micro-Nikkor 105\u2009mm\u2009f\/2.8\u2009G IF-ED lens) and removed from the solution for measurement of leaf number, stem length, root length and fresh weight. Stem length was measured from the first lateral root to the tip of the stem, and roots were measured on the basis of the longest root on the plantlet.\nFor the lettuce germination experiments, seeds were sterilized using a 15% bleach solution and a drop of Tween for every 50\u2009ml of sterilizing solution. The seeds were incubated in the sterilizing solution for 15 minutes while shaking and then washed five times with sterile water, five minutes for each wash while shaking. Ten lettuce seeds were placed on agar basal media (25\u2009ml) supplemented with acetate (0.1, 0.3, 0.6, 1, 2, 3, 6 or 10\u2009mM), with 2\u2009mM labelled13C2-acetate or with no additions to the base medium. They were allowed to germinate and grow for 28 days and were then imaged and removed to measure stem length, leaf number and fresh weight (not including the roots). Tissue samples for the13C-labelling experiments and the untreated controls were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280\u2009\u00b0C until they were used for metabolomic analysis. For the other plant species, the same sterilization procedure was used for the seeds, and the plants were grown until there was at least a few hundred milligrams of tissue for metabolomic analysis (canola, 14 days; rice, 14 days;Arabidopsis, 18 days; Micro-Tom tomato, 22 days; green pea, 22 days;Nicotiana benthamiana, 32 days; cowpea, 32 days).\nUndifferentiated lettuce callus was generated by plating pieces of lettuce leaf tissue on callus-inducing media (1\/2 Murashige and Skoog salts, 0.05\u2009mg\u2009l\u22121\u03b1-naphthaleneacetic acid, 0.4\u2009mg\u2009l\u221216-benzyl aminopurine and Gamborg\u2019s vitamins45) (Phytotech Labs). The calli were cut to the desired size and weighed to ensure that an equal amount of tissue was added to each flask. Each flask of calli was incubated in liquid 1\/2 Murashige and Skoog media supplemented with acetate,13C2-acetate or sucrose (2%) as indicated and to the specified concentrations. All cultures were grown at 22\u2009\u00b0C in the dark at 100 r.p.m. Tissue samples for the13C-labelling experiment and control samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280\u2009\u00b0C until they were used for metabolomic analysis.\nPlant tissue was freeze-dried, and then approximately 10\u2009mg was weighed into a 2\u2009ml tube and homogenized using a bead mill, using three 2.8\u2009mm beads per tube. To each sample, 750\u2009\u00b5l of 1:2 water:methanol was added, and the samples were then vortexed for 60\u2009min at 4\u2009\u00b0C. Then, 500\u2009\u00b5l of chloroform was added, and the samples were vortexed at 4\u2009\u00b0C for an additional 15\u2009min. After centrifugation for 10\u2009min (16,000gat 4\u2009\u00b0C), the top, polar layer was transferred to a glass vial and analysed by liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS).\nLC\u2013MS metabolomics analysis was performed at the University of California, Riverside Metabolomics Core Facility. The analysis was performed on a Synapt G2-Si quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Waters). Metabolite separations were carried out on an I-class UPLC system (Waters) using a ZIC-pHILIC column (2.1\u2009mm\u2009\u00d7\u2009150\u2009mm, 5\u2009\u00b5M) (EMD Millipore). The two mobile phases used were (A) water with 15\u2009mM ammonium bicarbonate adjusted to pH 9.6 with ammonium hydroxide and (B) acetonitrile. The column was held at 20\u2009\u00b0C, and the flow rate was 150\u2009\u00b5l\u2009min\u22121. The sample injection volume was 2\u2009\u00b5l. The following gradient was performed: 0\u2009min, 10% A, 90% B; 1.5\u2009min, 10% A, 90% B; 16\u2009min, 80% A, 20% B; 29\u2009min, 80% A, 20% B; 31\u2009min, 10% A, 90% B; 32\u2009min, 10% A, 90% B.\nThe mass spectrometer was operated in negative ion mode (50 to 1200m\/z) with a 100\u2009ms scan time. Tandem MS was acquired in a data-dependent fashion. The source temperature was 150\u2009\u00b0C, and the desolvation temperature was 600\u2009\u00b0C. Nitrogen was used as a desolvation gas (1,100\u2009l\u2009h\u22121) and cone gas (150\u2009l\u2009h\u22121). The collision gas used was argon. The capillary voltage was 2\u2009kV. Leucine enkephalin was infused and used for mass correction.\nData processing was performed with the open-source Skyline software46. Metabolites were identified by MS (less than 5\u2009ppm) and tandem MS using the Metlin database47. Data for isocitrate and citrate and for 2-phosphoglycerate and 3-phosphoglycerate are included as cumulative values (iso\/citrate and 2\/3-phosphoglycerate) because they are not distinguishable through the LC\u2013MS methodology used. The log213C enrichment was calculated for the heat maps using the equation:\nwhereMis the area under the curve measured by LC\u2013MS of molecules made up of12C atoms only, andM+Xis the area under the curve measured by LC\u2013MS of molecules with13C-isotope atoms incorporated into the molecule,Xbeing the number of13C-isotope atoms incorporated. When multiple biological replicates were available, they were averaged before dividing treatment by control. The untreated control replicates shown are a single representative replicate normalized to the average of all replicates, which helps visualize any variation between controls.\nThe following equations were used to determine the efficiency of the electrolysis process. Faradaic efficiency (FE) from gas chromatography was calculated as\nwherenis the number of electrons transferred,Fis Faraday\u2019s constant,xis the mole fraction of the product,Vis the total molar flow rate of the gas andjTotis the total current. Liquid Faradaic efficiency was calculated using quantitative1H-NMR.\nCarbon selectivity was calculated as\nwhereniis the number of electrons transferred to producti,jiis the partial current towards productiandCiis the number of carbons in producti. This value represents the percentage of CO2reacted towards C2+products found in a given product or the molar selectivity of a given product scaled to the number of carbons contained in it.\nTo determine the overall efficiency of the electrolysis process, we calculated the theoretical energy required to produce the C2+products and divided that by the actual amount of energy it took to produce those C2+products. The C2+product distribution is shown in Supplementary Table6, where we assume 1\u2009g of the C2+products.\nTheoretical potentials were calculated using the following equation:\nwhereE0is the theoretical potential,nis the number of electrons and \u0394G0is the Gibbs free energy of reaction.\nTheoretical energy was calculated as follows:\nwhere\\(E_i^0\\)is the theoretical cell potential for speciesi,miis the mass produced of productiand MWiis the molecular weight of producti. The values forE0andmcan be found in Supplementary Table6.\nThe actual energy input to produce 1\u2009g of C2+products is calculated using the following equation:\nwheremAcOis the mass of acetate produced to produce a total of 1\u2009g of C2+products at the Faradaic efficiencies calculated and listed in Supplementary Table6,nAcOis the number of moles of electrons passed per mole of acetate produced,ECOis the measured cell potential for the CO electrolyser, MWAcOis the molecular weight of acetate and FEAcOis the measured Faradaic efficiency of acetate. For the CO2electrolyser:\nwhereNCOis the moles of carbon monoxide necessary to produce a total of 1\u2009g of C2+products at the 92% (measured) conversion in the CO electrolyser,nCOis the number of electrons passed per mol of carbon monoxide produced,\\(E_{{\\mathrm{CO}}_2}\\)is the measured cell potential for the CO2electrolyser and FECOis the measured Faradaic efficiency of carbon monoxide.\nUsing the values listed in Supplementary Table6, the energetic efficiency was calculated by taking the ratio of the theoretical energy and the actual energy input per 1\u2009g of product:\nOur tandem electrolysis process has an energy efficiency of 35.62% for the production of all C2+products, which accounts for losses due to selectivity, conversion and overpotential. If you consider ethylene as a complete loss and consider only products in the effluent, the energy efficiency of C2+product production is 24.26%. We next calculated the energy efficiency of the production of just acetate, as this is what is used as the energy and carbon source for algal and yeast growth. To calculate acetate efficiency, we did not include losses due to selectivity because in a commercial setting, the other C2+products (for example, ethylene) would be considered co-products of the process. The efficiency numbers including ethylene as a co-product were used to calculate the energy efficiency of the whole system. More details are shown below:\nThe efficiency values reported here are based on the statistical averages of at least three biological replicates. These calculations were conducted similarly to the approaches in Blankenship et al.1and Nangle et al.48.\nThe energy efficiency of biological photosynthesis is defined as the energy content of the biomass that can be harvested annually divided by the annual solar irradiance over the same area1. To be able to compare our process to biological photosynthesis, we calculated the conversion efficiency of sunlight to biomass using photovoltaics to power our process of the electrolytic production of acetate followed by the heterotrophic cultivation ofChlamydomonasin the dark. We define the energy efficiency as the increase in biomass energy content divided by the required solar energy input. The increase in biomass energy content is calculated as\nwhere \u0394Xbiomassis the gain of algal biomass and\\(\\Delta H_{{\\mathrm{biomass}}}^{{\\circ}}\\)is the enthalpy of combustion of algal biomass, which was determined experimentally using an oxygen bomb calorimeter. The required solar energy input is calculated as\nwhereCAcOis the acetate concentration in the algal media, MWAcOis the molecular weight of acetate,wconsumedis the fraction of acetate consumed by the algae,EAcOis the energy required to generate acetate in the electrolyser (calculated above),\u03b7AM1.5is the maximum power conversion efficiency (peak solar intensity, AM1.5 spectral distribution) of a commercially available silicon solar cell (from Canadian Solar49,50) and\u03b7annualis the photovoltaic annual efficiency, which is about 95% of the maximum power conversion efficiency value due to the changing solar zenith angle throughout the day and year1. The energy efficiency is then calculated as\nComparison of this number with the ~1% annual efficiency for most crop plants1shows that our approach can be almost four times more energy efficient than biological photosynthesis for the cultivation of photosynthetic organisms. Improvements in photovoltaic maximum power conversion efficiency would increase the efficiency of our approach. For example, multi-junction solar cells have been shown to reach efficiencies as high as 47.1%49, which coupled to our system would bring the overall energy efficiency of sunlight to food to ~9%.\nFor Fig.5and Extended Data Fig.8, we calculated the energy efficiencies at each step within the system as follows:\nwhereYalgae\/acetateis the yield of algae grown with acetate effluent media, and\\(\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{AcO}}^{\\circ}\\)is the enthalpy of combustion of acetate.\nNutritional yeast is heterotrophic and is typically cultivated with glucose derived from biological photosynthesis as the primary carbon and energy source. In our process, electrolysis-derived acetate is substituted for glucose. To compare these two ways to produce yeast, we calculated the amount of yeast that could be produced per area of land in Illinois, a large corn-producing state in the United States. To calculate the amount of yeast that could be produced by our process independent of biological photosynthesis, we used the annual average solar irradiance in Illinois to calculate the electricity that could be generated by photovoltaics to synthesize acetate in the CO2electrolyser and subsequently used to cultivate yeast, as follows:\nwhereEeis the average annual solar irradiance from the North America Land Data Assimilation System Daily Sunlight (kJ\u2009m\u22122) dataset for Illinois from 2000 to 201151;\u03b7AM1.5is the maximum power conversion efficiency (peak solar intensity, AM1.5 spectral distribution) of a commercially available silicon solar cell49;\u03b7annualis the photovoltaic annual efficiency, which is about 95% of the maximum power conversion efficiency value due to the changing solar zenith angle throughout the day and year2;EAcOis the energy required to generate acetate in the electrolyser (calculated above); andYyeast\/acetateis the yield of yeast grown with acetate effluent media.\nTo calculate the amount of yeast that could be produced per area of land with biological photosynthesis, we used the annual corn harvest data from Illinois to determine the glucose that could be generated by photosynthesis and subsequently used as the primary carbon and energy source to cultivate yeast, as follows:\nwhere\\(Y_{{\\mathrm{corn}}\\;{\\mathrm{per}}\\;{\\mathrm{m}}^2}\\)is the average corn kernel production in Illinois per square meter52,Yglucose\/cornis the glucose produced from a bushel of corn kernels53andYyeast\/glucoseis the yield of yeast grown with glucose as the carbon source54. Using our artificial photosynthesis approach, almost 18 times more yeast could be produced per area of land.\nFor Extended Data Fig.8, we calculated the energy efficiencies at each step within the systems as follows:\nwhere\\(\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{biomass}}^{\\circ}\\)is the enthalpy of combustion of yeast biomass55,\\(\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{kernel}}^{\\circ}\\)is the enthalpy of combustion of corn kernels56,wglucose\/cornis the mass fraction of glucose found in a corn kernel53and\\(\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{glucose}}^{\\circ}\\)is the enthalpy of combustion of glucose.\nThere are many ways in which the energy of biological photosynthesis can be improved on, such as increasing CO2concentrations and metabolic engineering. We have included numbers for the theoretical maxima of both systems in Extended Data Fig.8b(refs.48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59).\nFurther information on research design is available in theNature Research Reporting Summarylinked to this article.\nThe metabolomics data (Fig.4aand Extended Data Figs.4and5b) and all source data can be found athttps:\/\/doi.org\/10.6086\/D1VT2Vin the Dryad Digital Repository.\nBlankenship, R.

Oxygen was allowed to vent to the atmosphere from anolytes. Primary products were used as effluents for growth.c, Electrolyser voltage of direct feed CO electrolyser using 2\u2009M KOH and 1\u2009M KHCO3. 1\u2009M KHCO3was produced in two separate effluents. Electrolyte was changed at 380\u2009minutes, causing the large spike in potential. 0.476\u2009M acetate: 1\u2009M KHCO3was produced in the first half of the KHCO3experiment, 0.648\u2009M acetate: 1\u2009M KHCO3in the second half, and 0.691\u2009M acetate: 1\u2009M KOH was produced in the 2\u2009M KOH experiment.d, Normalized production rate of dissolved CO reduction products collected in the effluent. Liquid product production rate from KHCO3is cumulative from both experiments, and represents the average over the entire experiment. Data presented represents one experiment for each electrolyte.e, Outlet molar fractions of gas products and feeds from the two-step electrolyser system (left axis). Flow rate (right axis) was measured continuously and is indicated by the arrow. The 5\u2009M NaOH scrubber introduced at 30\u2009minutes completely removed CO2. The CO electrolyser operated from 45 to 345\u2009minutes. The increase in flow rate is attributed to the increase in H2production over the course of experiment in the CO2electrolyser.f, Conversion of CO2and CO during the reaction. The CO2electrolyser was run without the scrubber at first (grey), a 5\u2009M NaOH scrubber was introduced at 45\u2009minutes (green), the CO electrolyser began operation at 60\u2009minutes (blue). No CO2was detected on gas chromatogram after the 5\u2009M NaOH scrubber was introduced. CO conversion is based on the average CO flow rate measured before CO electrolyser operation.g, Outlet molar concentrations of gas products and feeds (left axis) for CO2electrolyser and corresponding Faradaic efficiencies towards CO and H2(right axis) at varied inlet CO2flow rates. The arrow indicates the red and black scatter belong to the Faradaic efficiency of the system.h, Electrolyser voltage over the course of the flow rate experiment. Oscillations in cell voltage are due to oscillations in the back pressure controller. Step changes were caused by a decrease in inlet CO2flow rate.\na, The fraction of growth compared to growth in standard acetate media as electrolyte salt concentrations increased. Fraction of growth was calculated as cells per ml of culture grown in effluent media divided by cells per ml of culture grown in acetate positive control media on the last day of growth. Growth was not observed for electrolyte salt concentrations above 80\u2009mM. Media made with effluents that have lower electrolyte concentrations support higher amounts of growth. Standard acetate media is represented as 0\u2009M. Line is a linear regression (R2=\u20090.969).b, The same data as inabut plotted against acetate: electrolyte salt ratio. Media made with effluents with higher acetate-to-electrolyte salt ratio support higher amounts of growth. The threshold for growth is between 0.2 and 0.4 acetate-to-electrolyte salt ratio. Standard Tris-acetate-phosphate (TAP) media is arbitrarily set to a ratio of 0.8 since it contains no electrolyte. These graphs do not include growth ofChlamydomonaswith the most optimized effluents, as seen in Fig. 3.Chlamydomonascultures were grown in TAP media with effluent in place of acetate to match the acetate concentration of a typical liquid heterotrophic growth medium (17.5\u2009mM). All media was adjusted to pH 7.2.\na, b, c, d, e,Chlamydomonasgrown in the dark with electrolyser produced effluents (0.691\u2009M acetate: 1\u2009M KOH, 0.476\u2009M acetate: 1\u2009M KHCO3, and 0.648\u2009M acetate: 1\u2009M KHCO3), acetate, and no acetate. (a) Images taken on day 0 and 4, (b) cell counts, (c) optical density (OD) (750\u2009nm), (d) chlorophyll concentration, (e) and dry weight after 16 days of growth.f, Percentage of acetate in media utilized byChlamydomonasgrowth determined by comparing NMR measured acetate concentration of media before and after growth. Cultures were grown in Tris-acetate-phosphate (TAP) media with acetate, without acetate (TP), or with effluent in place of acetate to match the acetate concentration of a typical liquid heterotrophic growth medium (17.5\u2009mM). All media was adjusted to pH 7.2. Each data point represents three biological replicates. Error bars indicate standard deviations. Images are representative of all replicates.g, Mushroom mycelium\u2019s ability to colonize vermiculite substrate soaked with YPD media with no glucose (0\u2009g\u2009l-1) and increasing levels of effluent as the carbon source. Full colonization (+++) represents 75% to 100% of substrate colonized, partial colonization (++) represents 15% to 75%, limited colonization (+) represents 1% to 15% of substrate colonized. Effluent added to reach 0.5% (w\/w) acetate could support the growth of all fungal species evaluated.h, i, Images of pearl oyster (h) and enokitake (i) mushroom mycelium colonization of a solid vermiculite substrate soaked with YPD media containing glucose (20\u2009g\u2009l-1), glucose (20\u2009g\u2009l-1) and effluent (0.0691\u2009M acetate: 1\u2009M KOH) added to reach 0.5% (w\/w) acetate, or only effluent (0.0691\u2009M acetate: 1\u2009M KOH) in place of glucose (0\u2009g\u2009l-1) to reach 0.5% (w\/w) acetate as the primary carbon and energy source. Images were taken 24 days post inoculation and are representative of at least 3 replicates. Substrates were fully colonized for all three media. The morphology of the pearl oyster mycelium on top of the effluent containing substrate was different and not as \u2018fluffy\u2019 as compared to the glucose containing media. Images are representative of at least 3 replicates. Scale bars: 20\u2009mm.\nHeat map of all the replicates of the lettuce callus samples treated with no acetate (n\u2009=\u20093), 2\u2009mM13C-acetate (n\u2009=\u20093), 5\u2009mM13C-acetate + 5\u2009mM acetate from KHCO3effluent (0.648\u2009M acetate: 1\u2009M KHCO3, n\u2009=\u20093), or 5\u2009mM13C-acetate + 5\u2009mM acetate from KOH effluent (0.691\u2009M acetate: 1\u2009M KOH, n\u2009=\u20094). Number after treatment corresponds to the replicate number. Log2fold enrichment of13C between treated and untreated samples, see methods. All samples were grown in the dark showing the ability of plant cells to incorporate13C from acetate into biomass without light. M+1, 2, 3 or 4 denotes the additional mass of a molecule, which corresponds to the number of carbons in a molecule that are labeled with carbon isotopes.\na, Representative images showing crop plants grown with 2\u2009mM13C-acetate 1\/2 MS media and control 1\/2 MS media. These plants were later used for metabolomic analysis seen in Fig.4a.b, Heat map of the log2enrichment of13C-labeling in all crop replicates compared to the average value of non-treated controls used to create Fig.4a. The number after each plant name at the top of the figure corresponds to the replicate number. Samples grown without acetate with only one replicate are not included. There is enrichment in all treated crop samples. There are lower levels of13C-enrichment in green pea relative to other crops. This may be due to a larger reliance for carbon and energy from the endosperm of the seed resulting in less absorption of nutrients and13C2-acetate from the growth media.\na, b, Seed germination rate for lettuce after 28 days on (a) agar\u2009+\u20091\/2 MS\u2009+\u2009sucrose + acetate (b) agar\u2009+\u20091\/2 MS\u2009+\u2009acetate. 1\/2 MS is a typical plant nutrient mix for growth on agar. Seed germination percent is not significantly different from controls across all treatments (Tukey\u2019s HSD all p-values >0.15). All error bars represent the standard deviation between the germination percentage of the replicates (3 biological replicates with 10 seeds each). Images of lettuce seed germination and growth.c, d, The media was made of (c) 1\/2 MS\u2009+\u2009acetate, and (d) 1\/2 MS\u2009+\u2009sucrose + acetate. (c) 1\/2 MS\u2009+\u2009acetate visually shows the effect of acetate on plant growth in a concentration dependent manner. (d) Agar\u2009+\u20091\/2 MS\u2009+\u2009sucrose + acetate shows that supplementing lettuce with an additional carbon source, sucrose, does not affect the concentration dependent inhibition. All images are representative of all biological replicates for each treatment (3 biological replicates with 10 seeds each).e-lQuantify plant growth measurements: weight, root length, stem height, and leaf count for lettuce plants (~30 individuals shown, and 3 biological replicates visualized in red, grey, and blue for each treatment).e, g, iandk, show agar + 1\/2 MS\u2009+\u2009acetate. There is an acetate concentration dependent inhibition of plant growth that occurs at different concentrations of acetate for different traits, height being the most sensitive and leaf count being the least sensitive.f, h, jandl, show agar + 1\/2 MS\u2009+\u2009sucrose + acetate. Again, there is inhibition of growth at higher acetate concentrations of acetate (2-10\u2009mM). It did not appear that the addition of sucrose had a strong effect on growth, positive or negative, in combination with acetate. The box plots encompasses the quartiles of the dataset and the whiskers capture the rest of the data distribution, except for points that are determined to be \u201coutliers\u201d based on a function of the interquartile range60.\na, Representative images of lettuce seeds that were germinated and grown on control 1\/2 MS no acetate media, 1\/2 MS media supplemented with 1\u2009mM acetate KOH effluent (0.691\u2009M acetate: 1\u2009M KOH), and 1\/2 MS media supplemented with 1\u2009mM acetate Bicarbonate effluent (0.648\u2009M acetate: 1\u2009M KHCO3) (3 biological replicates with 10 seeds each with at least 18 total seeds germinating in each treatment). White scale bar is 2\u2009cm. All treatments had 3 biological replicates with 10 seeds each that were grown for 28 days and then growth parameters were measured and photographed. The white scale bar represents 2\u2009cm.b, c, d, eandf, show the leaf number, height, fresh weight, root length, and germination rate, respectively, of lettuce plants germinated and grown on no acetate, 1\u2009mM acetate KOH effluent (0.691\u2009M acetate: 1\u2009M KOH), and 1\u2009mM acetate bicarbonate effluent (0.648\u2009M acetate: 1\u2009M KHCO3). There was no statistical difference in weight between lettuce grown with (n\u2009=\u200921) and without (n\u2009=\u200918) effluent (p-value >0.05, Tukey\u2019s HSD). However there was a significant difference between the 0.691\u2009M acetate: 1\u2009M KOH for root length and height, which could suggest that the potassium salt may cause some level of inhibition.g, Representative images of the acetate feeding experiment performed on lettuce seedling. Lettuce seedlings were germinated for 11 days and then cut at the base of the stem and transferred to water and acetate solutions at acetate concentrations of 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.6, 1, 3, 6 and 10\u2009mM (n\u2009=\u20099 biological replicates for each treatment).h, i, jandk, show the height, leaf count, length of the roots, and the weight of the plants respectively. Root length was significantly increased in the presence of acetate (p-value <0.001, Tukey\u2019s HSD) (n\u2009=\u20099 for each treatment). Height for 6 and 10\u2009mM is not included due to incompatibility with the method of measuring the height, which was the distance from the top of the stem to the first lateral root, at these higher levels of acetate concentration there was poor root development, which led to artificially inflated height. There is a significant increase in root length in lower levels of acetate concentration (0.1, 1, and 3\u2009mM) based on Tukey\u2019s HSD statistical test, before higher acetate levels start to inhibit root growth. Significant p-values from Tukey\u2019s HSD comparing controls to treatment are denoted by an asterisk, p-value <0.05, double asterisk is a p-value <0.001, N.S. denotes no significant difference from controls (p-value > 0.05). All box plots encompass the quartiles of the dataset and the whiskers capture the rest of the data distribution, except for points that are determined to be \u201coutliers\u201d based on a function of the interquartile range60.\nThe energy efficiency of sunlight to food production through artificial photosynthesis and biological photosynthesis are compared. Major steps in energy conversion from sunlight (100% solar energy) to food are represented by arrows, with the percentage of remaining energy after each step indicated. The energy efficiency of each step is noted in parentheses.a, Same data as in Fig.5. The current efficiency numbers for algae production through artificial photosynthesis were determined in this work through experimentation (electricity to acetate and acetate to algae efficiencies). The value for solar to electricity efficiency is based on a commercially available silicon solar cell49,50. The value for biological photosynthetic efficiency was obtained from the literature1.b, Theoretical maximum efficiencies for both biological photosynthesis and artificial photosynthesis are given to show the potential of these approaches. The theoretical maximum efficiency for biological photosynthesis (6%) is for C4 plants (including maize, sugarcane, and sorghum). The theoretical maximum efficiency of biological photosynthesis for C3 plants (including rice, tomato, pepper, and cowpea) is 4.6% (not shown)57. The value for solar to electricity efficiency (47.1%) is from a lab demonstration of a multi-junction solar cell under concentrated illumination49. Continued improvements to electrolysis technology and acetate utilization in plants and algae would increase the overall efficiency of this artificial photosynthetic approach.c, The current efficiency numbers for nutritional yeast production through artificial photosynthesis were determined in this work through experimentation (electricity to acetate and acetate to yeast efficiencies). The value for solar to electricity efficiency is based on a commercially available silicon solar cell49,50. Nutritional yeast is typically grown using glucose derived from plants, such as corn. The efficiency was calculated using values for solar irradiance and corn productivity in Illinois, USA51,52.\nSupplementary Tables 1\u20136, Figs. 1 and 2, and Note.\nOpen AccessThis article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License, which permits use, sharing, adaptation, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons license, and indicate if changes were made.

Definitions of \u2018less\u2019 and \u2018better\u2019 lack clarity. Here we explore interpretations of these concepts, finding increasing use of \u2018less but better\u2019 in the literature from Western, high-income settings. Despite discrepancies among interpretations of \u2018less\u2019 meat, existing quantifications indicate that significant reduction is needed to achieve desirable food system outcomes. Interpretations of \u2018better\u2019 meat incorporate the delivery of environmental sustainability, improved animal welfare and better health or nutrition, but lack clear principles and omit many sustainability themes. Practices and outcomes are seldom linked, and diverging narratives on interactions between \u2018less\u2019 and \u2018better\u2019 exist. A shared vision of livestock systems with improved sustainability across multiple indicators is needed to establish principles for \u2018less but better\u2019 in order for decision-making to deliver desired outcomes.\nThe global food system is the source of many and diverse environmental and social pressures1,2,3. To respect planetary boundaries while providing adequate and nutritious food for all necessitates production improvements, waste reduction and transformation of dietary patterns3,4,5. Increasing incomes, urbanization6and Westernization of diets7,8,9,10have led to a global increase in annual meat consumption from 23\u2009kg per person in 1961 to 43\u2009kg per person in 2018 (slaughter weight11), but with considerable regional differences. In high-income countries, consumption of meat needs to be drastically reduced3,5and there is extensive literature comparing the environmental impact of meats versus other foods2,12,13,14,15and the impact of different diets3,4,16,17,18. The exact magnitudes of reductions, and how to attain these, is a source of debate within academia19,20,21,22, popular media23,24and policy-making circles25.\nTo eat and produce \u2018less but better\u2019 meat has been suggested by researchers26and non-governmental organizations27,28,29,30,31as a more politically feasible strategy than calling solely for meat reduction. Previous research has shown that \u2018less but better\u2019 meat is a concept in need of clarity, since how much \u2018less\u2019 is, and what \u2018better\u2019 should deliver depends among other things on the sustainability aspects considered, the local context and the desirable outcomes of the food system32. In this study we systematically review uses, definitions and interpretations of the concept in peer-reviewed scientific literature. We focus specifically on the \u2018less but better\u2019 concept, rather than intending to review all the literature on sustainability issues of livestock, as existing literature is scattered.\nWe identified 35 studies for inclusion (Fig.1) based on the eligibility criteria \ufeff(seeMethodssection). \u2018Less but better\u2019 has received greater attention in recent years. Two-thirds (n=\u200924) of the articles were published between 2018 and 2021 (Supplementary Table1), and all (bar one) by authors in Europe, the United States or Australia, demonstrating that this concept is most used in Western, high-income settings\u2014where overconsumption of meat and dairy is greatest11, and where a shift to more sustainable diets underpinned by sustainable production is most pressing. The majority of selected articles focus on consumption (n=\u200923), including consumer acceptance and choice, although a significant number of articles span both production and consumption (n=\u200911). Just one article focuses principally on production33. None of the included articles stated defining \u2018less but better\u2019 as a research aim.\nPRISMA workflow diagram outlining the systematic review process. The left-hand panels show the four phases of the review and the centre and right-hand boxes show the number of articles for each step.\nMost articles (n=\u200922) define \u2018less but better\u2019 in the context of their study, but 13 cite a definition from an alternative source26,34. There was broad agreement that \u2018less but better\u2019 meat should deliver positive outcomes for animal welfare, human health and environmental sustainability. Which farming practices deliver desired outcomes was seldom specified or evidenced (Fig.2). Selected articles predominantly used definitions of \u2018better\u2019 meat based on outcomes33,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47. Definitions based on specific farming practices were less frequent48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55.\nOutcome- and practice-based descriptions of \u2018better\u2019 meat found in selected articles.\nLinkages and contradictions between these two types of definitions were apparent. Grass-feeding livestock could facilitate increased resource efficiency (that is, environmental sustainability)33. However, feedlot systems could perform most favourably if the desired outcome is reducing land use per kilogram of meat produced2. Practices that improve animal welfare are largely overlooked, except reduced stocking densities53,56. There is a lack of evidence regarding farming practices that improve nutritional quality. One paper for example claims \u201cthe nutrients are different\u201d in free-range meat49, but without evidence to support this.\nAll papers referenced the need for reduced consumption (Supplementary Table2), but only eight quantified this. Quantifications were primarily relative, used different units (for example, grams of food versus protein) and definitions (animal-sourced foods versus animal protein versus meat). Recommendations on limiting consumption ranged from 9 to 105\u2009g per capita per day (Fig.3)38,41,44,45,57,58. One study provides an absolute quantification, suggesting that livestock on ecological leftovers could globally provide 9\u201323\u2009g per capita per day of animal-sourced protein (including milk and eggs), covering 16\u201342% of average daily protein requirements33. Studies seldom stated which meat types were included or whether figures referred to slaughter or cooked weight, despite these factors having an influence on sustainability impacts.\nAll values have been recalculated to grams of meat protein per person per day using a 20% protein content in meat (seeSupplementary Informationfor data) except the figure in Neff et al.44, which includes eggs and refers to a daily recommended intake limit (grey bar). The shaded bars for van Zanten et al.33and de Boer and Aiking38indicate that these articles describe \u2018less\u2019 as ranges.\nInterpretations of \u2018better\u2019 were varied with regard to sustainability (Fig.4, Supplementary Table3). Climate (lower carbon footprint)22,33,35,36,37,44,52,58,59,60,61,62, land use (grass-fed meat minimizing feed\u2013food competition) and animal welfare22,26,33,35,36,42,45,50,51,52,54,57,60,63were mentioned frequently. Eight studies discussed eating quality37,38,46,47,54,58,59,64, two of them linking it to animal welfare46,54. Discussion on sustainability and quality trade-offs was noted, for example, swapping beef for chicken to lower emissions22,52,62, which could result in increased feed\u2013food competition, animal welfare issues, displaced nutrient losses and deteriorating eating quality from mass production45,50,52,60. Grass-fed beef and dairy is more emissions-intensive when assessed by product weight, but has benefits for other sustainability areas22,35,44,61.\nThe figure shows the number of articles in which sustainability themes were mentioned. Note that articles appear more than once if they reference multiple themes.\nMany other sustainability aspects were underdiscussed. Biodiversity was mentioned frequently, but rarely as a criterion for \u2018better\u2019, including grazing for promoting biodiversity22,36. Health or nutrition were referenced frequently concerning \u2018less\u2019 meat. In relation to \u2018better\u2019, fat content40,58,59and public health issues such as air quality associated with intensive production were cited22,42. Other aspects, such as digestibility, iron and vitamin B12 were absent. Freshwater use26,35,54and nutrient balance or eutrophication33,50,51each appeared in three papers. Views on hormones, antimicrobials and genetically modified organisms ranged from negative for public health42to positive for efficiency35. Social and economic sustainability aspects were largely missing. No articles dealt with matters of well-being, working conditions or governance. Maintenance of rural landscapes was mentioned twice36,52. One paper called for \u201csocially acceptable\u201d production41while another pointed to the importance of ensuring that meat reduction strategies do not negatively impact farmers63. Financial risks of intensive systems appeared once53. The most frequently discussed socioeconomic aspect was the importance of close relationships between consumers and producers46,47,50,51, including consumers perceiving meat bought at a local butcher as \u2018better\u201946,54,58. High- and low-quality meat was often referred to but not defined. One paper reported that Chinese consumers prefer industrially produced meat which they associate with quality and safety65.\nMost articles (n=\u200924) on \u2018less but better\u2019 mentioned a specific farming system (Table1). This reveals a dominant narrative in the literature that \u2018better\u2019 meat comes from extensive, mixed, local systems that use few, if any, external inputs such as feeds and chemicals. Whether these forms of production constitute more sustainable farming has been studied by many66,67,68,69,70,71, but was also criticized as a \u201crose-tinted view(s) of traditional food production\u201d because of the higher emission intensities, land use and water use of extensive beef and pork35. This dispute between organic\/nature-based solutions or intensification72,73as \u2018better\u2019 is commonly referred to as \u2018land sharing\u2019 and \u2018land sparing\u201974,75, and sustainability impacts are widely debated. Both approaches would, however, require a shift in diets, that is \u2018less\u2019 meat67,68,71,76.\nOrganic could be considered to deliver \u2018better\u2019 because organic labels are the most recognized cues available to consumers. For example: \u201cAs Dutch consumers had no shopping-aid to distinguish grass-fed meat \u2026 \u2018better\u2019 meat was defined as \u2018organic or free range meat\u2019\u201d26. This indicates that fully grass-fed meat is considered \u2018better\u2019 than organic, although few articles presented it as such (Table1). Consumers opting for organic are found to adhere more to other sustainability-promoting behaviours such as eating less meat26,54,77, although the underlying drivers of this relationship are unclear.\nMost papers focused on single actors or scales, or interactions between two actors (for example, producer\u2013consumer relations). Only two studies addressed system-level aspects, for example, that beef from dairy rather than suckler herds can be a \u2018better\u2019 option, both considering the climate impact of the meat and the resource efficiency of the food system53. The structural dynamics of the current, highly globalized meat production system also has implications for \u2018better\u201950. Industrialization has, among other factors, caused concentration of livestock in certain regions, resulting in eutrophication, pollution, overgrazing and land abandonment, and a more localized, circular production system could therefore be a \u2018better\u2019 option50.\nA strength of \u2018less but better\u2019 is its consideration of both production and consumption, supporting the identification of trade-offs and win\u2013win outcomes. We found several interactions between \u2018less\u2019 and \u2018better\u2019 with implications for dissonance or coherence between scales (Fig.5).\nIllustrations of interlinks between \u2018less\u2019 and \u2018better\u2019 based on importance of the two.\n\u2018Less\u2019 was sometimes seen as a prerequisite for \u2018better\u2019\u2014for example, \u201cthe significant reduction of farm animal production \u2026 in order to improve the production standards for the remaining animals\u201d41. \u2018Less for better\u2019 at local scale could address localized impacts of livestock production, but unless national consumption is reduced, this strategy risks offshoring food production impacts and increasing reliance on imported goods.\nAnother interpretation was that the \u2018better\u2019 option is to eat \u2018less\u2019 meat (\u2018less as better\u2019), with improvements to production as a secondary goal. There are commercial challenges in promoting \u2018less\u2019 without \u2018better\u2019 and a concerted societal effort including policy interventions would be needed to enable this26,57. This view also neglects that food\u2019s environmental impacts primarily occur at the production stage2. Food is often heralded as holding the potential to deliver multiple Sustainable Development Goals, including addressing climate change and biodiversity loss78. Without a focus on production, it is difficult to see how this could be realized, and \u2018less and worse\u2019 can hardly be desirable.\nA conflicting narrative defined \u2018better\u2019 as meat with lower emissions intensity per unit of output (sustainable intensification), which would allow for unchanged consumption, that is, \u2018better\u2019 without \u2018less\u201960. This, however, ignores the need to reduce high-income meat consumption, for example, to meet the 1.5\u2009\u00b0C climate goal3,79,80and metrics per kilogram of product or protein seldom account for sustainability trade-offs and complexity. \u2018Better\u2019 without \u2018less\u2019 could thus become a cover-up for business-as-usual and an attempt at greenwashing.\nOne criticism of \u2018less but better\u2019 is that it puts responsibility on consumers to make sustainable, ethical or \u2018better\u2019 choices rather than recognizing issues caused by capitalist agrifood systems (refs.81,82,83,84in ref.64), thus depoliticizing the issue. Without clear definitions of \u2018less\u2019 or \u2018better\u2019, the concept cannot place responsibility where responsibility is due. Among the included articles, very few address how value-chain actors beyond producers and consumers ought to facilitate \u2018less and better\u2019 (except57). Some interpret \u2018less but better\u2019 as more radical, going hand-in-hand with \u201cfood sovereignty\u2019s anti-capitalist orientation\u201d requiring \u201cagro-ecological and smallholder farming methods\u201d and \u201credistributive land reform\u201d48.\nWhile relevant in high-income settings, \u2018less but better\u2019 is not suitable for regions where diets are nutritionally inadequate. In these areas, \u2018more and better\u2019 meat may be more relevant79,80,85. To stay within planetary boundaries globally, however, a focus on \u2018less\u2019 in overconsuming areas is needed to make room for \u2018better\u2019 in regions where consumption of animal-sourced foods needs to increase. In the FAO\u2019s \u2018Towards Sustainability\u201985scenario, for example, animal herd sizes in high-income countries would decrease by 2030 and further by 2050 while the opposite development would occur in low-income regions. The scenario also postulates that highly productive livestock-rearing practices would have to be abandoned and most regions would have less intensive livestock systems, including a rewilding of 3\u20134% of arable land in Europe. In-depth analysis of the implications of such transitions for producers was missing in the literature. To enable \u2018better\u2019 at scale, incentives and policy mechanisms such as product labelling, price premiums and fair payment for delivery of public goods are necessary, as is diversification of farm incomes to maintain viable farm businesses when meat production is reduced70,71.\n\u2018Empowered consumers\u2019 willing to reduce their meat consumption are often highly educated, women and\/or from high-income households44,58,59, and are a minority of the population26,58,59. They tend to be less price sensitive than \u2018average\u2019 consumers47,59, giving \u201cthese more conscious forms of food consumption \u2026 a distinctive middle-class appeal\u201d52. Speaking in favour of the potential of \u2018less and better\u2019 is the combination of reducing consumption and eating meat of higher quality as consumers could maintain current spending while improving sustainability22,39,43. This makes \u2018less but better\u2019 a more acceptable message than \u2018eat no meat\u201922,61. Whether higher prices would drive sufficient meat reduction is, however, unclear44\u2014high-income consumers can probably afford to maintain consumption anyway44,54, and meat-loving consumers are often driven by taste and eating quality47,58. A strong personal interest is required from the consumer to adopt a \u2018less and better\u2019 diet. Policy interventions and commitment from businesses to reduce meat intake and make \u2018better\u2019 options accessible to a broader spectrum of consumers are key to realize the full potential of \u2018less but better\u2019.\nThe \u2018less but better\u2019 meat concept is increasingly used in the English-language scientific literature, especially in Western, high-income settings. There is, however, a lack of consensus on how much \u2018less\u2019 is, as most studies provide no quantification despite often evaluating the efficacy of meat reduction strategies. Based on existing quantifications (n=\u20098), \u2018less\u2019 involves a significant reduction from current consumption. The use of different scopes and measures could inhibit progress, and probably creates confusion. Future studies should provide more clarity and transparency around recommendations on \u2018less\u2019. Ideally, these should encompass all animal-sourced foods, not just meat, given the sustainability impacts of all livestock production.\nThere is a similar lack of coherence in definitions and interpretations of \u2018better\u2019. The idea that \u2018better\u2019 meat should deliver \u2018environmental sustainability\u2019, improved animal welfare and better health outcomes is not accompanied by clear principles, and many key sustainability themes, including social and economic aspects, are absent from discussions. There is a lack of clarity on desirable outcomes from human\u2013livestock interactions and what practices would deliver these at different scales. This missing link between practices and outcomes results in a lack of clarity on \u2018less but better\u2019, preventing the concept from bridging bodies of literature on meat and sustainability. If the concept is to be used to guide food systems decision-making in policy and industry environments, there is a need to develop principles or best-practice guidelines to ensure alignment and progress toward desired outcomes. More work needs to be done to establish a vision of future livestock production systems that have improved outcomes across sustainability themes and can be agreed on by a wide range of stakeholders.\nWe conducted a systematic review of the literature published in accordance with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines86(Fig.1).\nWe did not submit a review protocol to PROSPERO (or similar) because this review does not evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention, test the accuracy of a diagnostic or similar, or aim to synthesize the current state of knowledge regarding the prevalence or incidence of a phenomenon.\nAfter defining the scope and aim of the study, we identified search terms and eligibility criteria (Table2). At this stage we sought input from three external independent experts to refine our search strategy.\nOn 2 June 2021 we performed searches on Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar to identify relevant scientific literature (step 1, Fig.1).\nWe used the terms \u2018meat\u2019 AND \u2018less but better\u2019 OR \u2018less and better\u2019 and limited the search to peer-reviewed studies published in English since year 2000, which were available as full-text options online.\nThe search yielded 818 entries. We screened titles and abstracts and excluded papers not dealing with meat consumption and reduction, or meat production and livestock (step 2, Fig.1). We screened the full texts for mention and definition of \u2018less but better\u2019, \u2018less and better\u2019 or \u2018less-but-better\u2019 (step 3, Fig.1). To reduce bias, both authors screened independently, and discrepancies during cross-checks were resolved through discussion. A final 36 articles (six correspondence or viewpoints) were included. Resare Sahlin et al.32was used as basis for the thematic coding because it is the first paper focusing on defining the concept, thus leaving 35 articles included in the study.\nWe manually coded in Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Word87using 37 initial codes based on ref.32and 24 codes inductively identified from individual coding of four randomly selected articles. Subsequent comparison and discussion refined the coding framework, based on which we then coded all 35 papers.\nCoded text was transferred to a Word document and grouped thematically to allow for analysis of definitions and interpretations87. To reduce bias, both authors independently reviewed thematic clusters and looked for emerging narratives. These were then compared and discussed before key results were documented. Quantifications of \u2018less\u2019 were normalized (Supplementary Table5). We created tables of concept definitions (Supplementary Table4) and sustainability themes and production systems in the context of \u2018better\u2019 (Table1and Supplementary Table3). Rounds of inductive analysis elicited narratives of interlinkages of \u2018less\u2019 and \u2018better\u2019.\nSince this study does not assess the applicability or accuracy of any scientific finding or conducted study, or seek to make any recommendation based on these, but instead seeks to report on existing narratives, the importance of the risk of bias in the included article is not relevant to the findings. To reduce internal biases within the research theme, which risk impacting the exploratory, qualitative approach, we conducted coding and analysis independently and discussed throughout, and moreover took a deductive\u2013inductive approach to ensure results were not restricted by the a priori coding framework. Expanding the search to other languages would probably have yielded more relevant materials; however, in the regions where the concept is most relevant (Western, high-income countries), English is the key language for scientific publication and this limitation is thus justified.\nFurther information on research design is available in theNature Research Reporting Summarylinked to this article.\nData used in this study, including a list of papers reviewed, can be found in theSupplementary Information.\nGordon, L. et al.

Here we create high-resolution global maps showing where crops are harvested for seven broad use categories\u2014food, feed, processing, export, industrial, seed and losses. Yields for food crops are low relative to other crop-use categories. It is unlikely, given current trends, that the minimum calorie requirement to eliminate projected food undernourishment by 2030 will be met through crops harvested for direct food consumption, although enough calories will be harvested across all usages. Sub-Saharan African nations will probably fall short of feeding their increased population and eliminating undernourishment in 2030, even if all harvested calories are used directly as food.\nCompetition for crops harvested for various uses has mounted in recent decades1. Crops used for animal feed, crop-based biofuels and other end uses can result in a smaller fraction of the same crop being available for direct human consumption as food. This competition also includes crop switching from those that are directly consumed as food to those that are not. In addition, rising demand for animal feed combined with inefficient feed conversion ratios ultimately mean reductions in calories left for human consumption2,3, challenging the achievement of the United Nations\u2019 (UN\u2019s) Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2 of food security for all by 20304. There are many dimensions of food insecurity, and merely increasing food production does not ensure food access, utilization and stability5. Yet, at present, there is widespread yield stagnation in major global food cereals6,7, and a growing global middle class is increasing its demand for food products that rely on crops harvested for feed and processing8. Shifting uses and demands are also producing profound environmental and climate impacts through unsustainable resource use and the clearing of natural landscapes, raising questions about whether the trends in crop harvests, when not meant for direct food consumption, are aligned with the common interests of meeting the SDGs9,10,11.\nThere is a current lack of detailed understanding of the patterns and trends of crops harvested for initial usage across the world. This has hampered the development of effective, locally relevant policies that balance global needs of food security and minimizing environmental impacts12,13,14,15through reconfigurations of cropping systems. Here we combine annual country-level information on seven uses of crop production1\u2014food, feed, processing, export, industrial, seed and losses\u2014over 50 years (1964\u20132013) with recently developed annual global gridded harvested areas and yields of ten major individual crops16. These ten major global crops\u2014barley, cassava, maize, oil palm, rapeseed, rice, sorghum, soybean, sugar cane and wheat\u2014account for ~83% of all harvested food calories17and ~63% of global harvested areas18, a proportion that has remained stable for the past half century (between ~58% and 64%). Specifically in our analysis, a crop\u2019s grid cell-level harvested area is split (Methodsand Supplementary Data1) and combined with yields (tons\u2009ha\u22121per year) to give seven uses of crop production (tons per year). Using the crop-specific calorie, protein and fat contents (which can vary widely among crops), we estimate the total grid cell-level calories, protein and fat production and nutritional yields for the seven utilization categories.\nGrowth in harvests of crops meant for exports, processing and industrial use, together with their higher yields and faster yield gains, stands out globally; at a more granular level, this was driven by specific global regions that are getting increasingly specialized in harvesting crops for these usages.\nAt the global scale, we find that crops harvested for direct food utilization have the highest area and have been relatively stable over the study period (Fig.1a). However, as the total harvested hectares have increased globally (Supplementary Table1), this has translated into decreasing fractions of crops harvested for direct food utilization, from ~51% in the 1960s (average over 1964 to 1968) to ~37% in the 2010s (average over 2009 to 2013), with a similar reduction in feed crop harvests (Table1). Conversely, there has been a substantial increase in crops for processing, exports and industrial use (Fig.1a, Table1and Supplementary Table1). The increase in industrial crop harvests occurred after year 2000. Around the same time, harvested hectares for exported crops ramped up and by the 2010s had surpassed those of crops harvested for feed use (Fig.1a). Crops harvested for seed usage and losses are relatively minor, and we will not discuss them further. If the global trends observed in the past 20 years continue (Fig.1a), by 2030, crops harvested for exports, processing and industrial use will account for ~ 23%, 17% and 8% of overall harvested hectares, whereas those for food will decrease to ~29% (Table1).\na\u2013d, Observed total harvested ha (a), average yield in kcal\u2009ha\u22121per year (b), average yield in protein\u2009ha\u22121per year (c) and average yield in fat\u2009ha\u22121per year (d) in the seven sectors of food, feed, processing, export, other uses (non-food\/industrial), seed and losses from 1964 to 2013, annually, and projections to 2030 based on the past 20 years. The shading shows the 90% confidence interval for the significant linear model projections.\nWe find that crops harvested for direct food usage generally have had lower yields than all other sectors at the global scale over the time period of the study (Fig.1b\u2013d). This is not a new phenomenon, as crops harvested for direct food utilization have always had lower yields relative to other sectors (Supplementary Table1). What has changed, however, is the ramping up (steeper positive slopes) of industrial, export and processing crop yields (Fig.1b\u2013dand Table1). At these rates, caloric yields of industrial-use crops could increase by 28% from the 2010s to 2030 compared with 24% and 21% yield increases of crops harvested for directly consumed food and for feed use (Fig.1b). Given that caloric yields of industrial-use crops are already substantially higher than food and feed crops (2\u00d7 and 1.4\u00d7, respectively, in the 2010s), the faster caloric yield increases for industrial-use crops will widen this gap (2.1\u00d7 and 1.5\u00d7, respectively). Yield measurements in other units of protein and fat show similar results (Table1, Fig.1c,dand Supplementary Table1).\nWithin country-level information on harvested areas and productivity based on utilization categories is required for developing more locally effective agricultural policies. Over the course of the study time period 1964 to 2013 (Fig.2a,band Supplementary Video1), we find changes in all continents when spatially analysed at the grid-cell level, except for most parts of Africa. Even in Africa, there are locations with fractional reductions in food crop harvests over the study period, such as parts of Angola, Ghana, Nigeria and South Africa. Within these and other countries, the exact location, magnitude and direction of the change varies from one region to the next (that is, compare Fig.2awith Fig.2b).\na,b, The fraction of a grid cell in one of seven categories\u2014food, feed, processing, export, other (non-food\/industrial use), seed and losses\u2014in each period, 1964\u20131968 (a) and 2009\u20132013 (b).\nCrops harvested for direct food utilization have been prevalent in Asia, though much has changed since the 1960s (Fig.2a,band Supplementary Video1). In China, there appears to be an imaginary belt, north and west of which harvests of crops used as directly consumed food decreased between the 1960s (Fig.2a) and 2010s (Fig.2b), while those for other uses increased. This belt appears to roughly extend from the northern half of Jiangsu (a province on the Yellow Sea in the east), curving westwards and southwards through northern Anhui, southern Henan, central Hubei and the northern tip of Hunan, and then turning sharply south and splitting Guangdong (a province on the South China Sea) through the middle. The sector gaining from the 10\u201320% fractional food harvest reduction varies. The increase in crops for feed, processing and industrial usage increases as one moves northward, especially north of Jiangsu and Anhui (Fig.2a,band Supplementary Video1).\nSimilarly, in India, there is a north\u2013south zone encompassing eastern Haryana in the north, moving southwards through eastern Rajasthan, western Madhya Pradesh to eastern Maharashtra in the south, where there was a drastic reduction in crops harvested for direct food utilization over the study period (Fig.2and Supplementary Video1); crops harvested for processing primarily increased. Changes in South and Southeast Asia over the study period are primarily away from once-dominant harvests of directly consumed food crops to feed crops, followed by processing crops, export crops and industrial-use crops, as in Myanmar and Thailand. In Malaysia, the growth was in export and industrial-usage crops, whereas in Indonesia, it was export crops and smaller increases in industrial-utilization crops. Central Asian states, especially Kazakhstan and some parts of Russia, witnessed a large reduction in crops harvested for direct food use over the study period, replaced by the crops destined for exports between the two periods (Fig.2and Supplementary Video1).\nIn Australia in the 1960s, food crops were harvested everywhere, accounting for ~10% of the total, which declined to ~5% by the 2010s. This was accompanied by small reductions in crops harvested for feed and export and balanced mainly by increases in crops for processing and industrial utilization (Fig.2and Supplementary Video1).\nIn Europe in the 1960s, crops were dominantly harvested for food and feed, but by the 2010s, this changed to include crops harvested for processing (Fig.2and Supplementary Video1). In France, major reductions in feed crops have been balanced by growth in processing, export and industrial-use crops. In Spain, the primary change is from crops harvested for direct food to those of feed. In Germany, crops harvested for export have replaced those for direct food utilization.\nLatin America used to dominantly harvest food crops (as in Mexico) or food and feed crops (as in Brazil and Argentina) (Fig.2and Supplementary Video1). Midwestern Brazil used to harvest only food crops, and feed and processing crop harvests were restricted to the Atlantic states (the 1960s; Fig.2a), but by the 2010s (Fig.2b), harvests of food crops had become a negligible fraction in Midwestern Brazil (as in Mato Grosso), and crops harvested for processing and exports are dominant now. In the Atlantic states of Brazil, one of the major changes is the increased proportion of harvests for industrial crops. In Argentina, over the study period, the proportion of crops harvested for food and feed has decreased, and this utilization has been mainly replaced by crops harvested for processing; crops harvested for exports changed, but the direction of change was spatially heterogeneous across Argentina (Fig.2and Supplementary Video1). In Mexico, the primary change is the reduction in the fraction of crops harvested for direct food consumption and the increased harvests of crops for feed.\nCrops harvested for food and feed are also on the decline proportionally in North America. The United States has experienced a change from the dominance of food and feed crops in the 1960s to processing and industrial-usage crops in the 2010s. Detailed changes in the United States and Canada vary from one location to the next (Fig.2), though the major change is the lower fraction of crops harvested for direct food consumption.\nResults are similar when viewed through the lens of calories, protein and fat with local-level differences as yields vary based on the measurement units (Supplementary Fig.1). Further dramatic changes can be expected if observed linear trends from 1994 to 2013 at each grid cell continued until 2030 (Supplementary Fig.2).\nWe compare the extra food calories that will potentially be harvested in 2030 (Fig.3aand Supplementary Data2) to those required for both the projected extra population and feeding the projected undernourished population in each country (Fig.3band Supplementary Data2). As an extreme case, we also compared whether total calories (all seven utilization sectors) would be sufficient (Fig.3cand Supplementary Data2). Altogether, we evaluated 156 countries, of which 86 had reported undernourished populations (Supplementary Data2). On the basis of the minimum dietary energy requirement (MDER), we find that countries with reported undernourished populations will have a shortfall of ~675.4 trillion kcal per year to nourish the increased population and the expected undernourished from their extra harvested food calories. However, compared with the more realistic average dietary energy requirement (ADER), this shortfall will be ~993.9 trillion kcal per year (or ~70% from requirements) in 2030 (15 additional scenarios of undernourished populations in 2030 (provided in Supplementary Data3) show global calorie shortfalls may similarly range from ~587.2 trillion kcal per year to ~1,269.3 trillion kcal per year based on the MDER level of nutrition requirement, and ~880.7 trillion kcal per year to ~1,755.6 trillion kcal per year based on the more realistic ADER level of nutrition requirement in 2030).\na, Same as Fig.2but for the projected kcal\u2009ha\u22121per year in 2030 per utilization sector and then mapping the fraction of total kcal\u2009ha\u22121per year projected as harvested.b, Shortfall or gap from kcal per year harvested in 2030 as crops for direct food use and those to plug the gap from population growth and\/or undernourished population. Computed based on the 2018 to 2020 ADER number for the country.c, Same asbbut the kcal per year harvested used for computation is the total across all the seven sectors and shortfall is from whether the total calories harvested were used for direct food consumption (little to no processing).\nCountries reporting undernourishment can, however, meet their requirement of extra calories in 2030 for both population change and those for the undernourished if calories from other utilization sectors are diverted and consumed directly as food calories (Fig.3cand Supplementary Data2and3). Though at the global scale, it appears that countries with high levels of undernourishment in 2030 can divert just a portion of their total harvested calories and meet some of the requirements of UN\u2019s SDG 2 (ref.4). In reality, many of the individual countries concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa have limited scope of diversion of calories from other sectors such as feed, processing or exports as crops for direct food use, as they already harvest most crops for direct food consumption (Fig.2and Supplementary Figs.1and2). As such, many countries in this region may see deepening reliance on food imports. Note that the UN\u2019s second SDG goal is broader in scope, including efforts to end malnutrition and increase agricultural productivity, among other goals4. Reconfiguration planning19can use our spatially detailed information (Figs.2and3, Supplementary Figs.1and2and Supplementary Data2and3) in conjunction with policies that incentivize increased food crop harvests globally and ensure their equitable distribution to undernourished regions when local production is not sufficient20,21. This will require supply chain management22,23and detailed analysis of optimization scenarios24with our maps and tables as an important step linking specific production regions with the initial use of that production.\nSpatially, the shift in the harvested area from food and feed towards processing in the United States is reflective of the evolving role of the country in global crop production and renewable energy targets25. Similar but less dramatic changes have occurred in Europe. The changes observed in Latin America from a region oriented to food production, to harvesting feed and processing crops, have been observed since the late 1990s with the expansion of maize and soybean harvests pushed by commodity prices and exchange rate26and at the cost of tropical ecosystems27,28,29,30. China\u2019s movement away from harvesting crops for direct food utilization to processing and feed crops has been mainly driven by the changes in its consumption structure due to rising incomes and population where people demand high-value food products31. The country can substantially improve its domestic soybean (and other crops) production by optimizing the spatial distribution (Fig.2and Supplementary Figs.1and2) and thus reducing pressure on domestic and foreign environmental resources. Similarly, in India, demand for processed food has increased due to demographic changes and health consciousness, increased demand for branded and convenient items, modernization of retail and food service sectors and heightened efforts to develop food manufacturing by the government31.\nThough a lack of other micronutrients such as vitamin A, iron and zinc can produce a suite of deficiency diseases3,32,33, here we restrict ourselves to macronutrient production for their initial utilization. After the initial intended utilization, there could also be a flow between utilizations, the easiest of which to understand is crops harvested for exports turning up in any utilization category within importing nations (including re-exported), a more complicated problem of global flows between nations and categories34that should be explored in subsequent investigations. The sector-specific crop-utilization information at the time of crop harvests that we present are estimates and built using gridded crop16and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN Food Balance Sheet (FAO FBS)1data annually for 50 years from 1964 to 2013; post-2013 FAO FBS data uses a different methodology (detailed sources of uncertainty are provided in Methods). Nevertheless, our analysis provides new insights into the shifting patterns of crop utilization within nations and has important implications for the sustainability of natural resource use and the fraction of resource use that directly supports food security and nutrition.\nWe find that over roughly 50 years, the growth in global crop harvests (total harvested hectares have increased 28%) favoured exports, industrial- and processing-use crops. In specific areas of the world, this change has accompanied reductions in food and feed crop harvests. We also find low food crop yields and the potential for industrial crop yields to become more than twice those of food crops and 1.5 times those of feed crops by 2030. Much of the non-direct food harvest regions are in food-secure or wealthy nations outside of sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, which does not increase undernourishment in these regions from production constraints. However, changes are underway even in food-insecure regions. We find that out of the 86 countries with undernourished populations studied (seeMethodsfor countries not studied yet likely to have undernourished population), 31 countries will probably not meet their caloric requirements in 2030 for the undernourished and the increased population, even when all harvested calories were diverted and used as food calories (Fig.3c); another 17 countries will probably not meet the caloric requirement of their expected extra population in 2030, raising the question how will they then feed their undernourished population (Fig.3c). We recommend that food-insecure nations, non-governmental organizations and other aid groups immediately incentivize harvests and yield growth of directly consumed food crops. To close any gap in nourishment in food-insecure nations that cannot be locally met, highly productive world regions should also be incentivized to divert a portion of their production towards directly consumed food crops. Such changes should prioritize equitable access for the food undernourished and ensure justice for farmers and agriculture-sector livelihoods and should be substantively discussed during policymaking.\nAnnual global crop-utilization maps were developed from fusing national-level fractional crop-utilization information and gridded crop maps. Fractional crop-utilization data were built using the FAO FBS (old methodology data that extends from 1961 to 2013)1. We first compute the total utilization of food, feed, processed, export, industrial, seed and loss per crop in each country and for each year and then compute the fractional utilization (Supplementary Data1). In other words, the same crop can have seven different utilizations that vary each year. For each of these ten crop product groups in the FAO FBS1\u2014(1) barley and products, (2) cassava and products, (3) maize and products, (4) palm oil plus palm kernel oil, (5) rape and mustard seed, (6) rice and products, (7) sorghum and products, (8) soyabeans, (9) sugar cane and (10) wheat and products\u2014the utilization is reported in thousands of tons. The annual (seven) fractions of these ten product groups are fused respectively to (1) barley, (2) cassava, (3) maize, (4) oil palm, (5) rapeseed, (6) rice, (7) sorghum, (8) soybean, (9) sugar cane and (10) wheat annual gridded crop data. The gridded crop data are an updated version of crop-specific harvested areas and yields at 5\u2009min spatial resolution16. The national-level crop-utilization fraction information is used to split a crop\u2019s grid cell-level total harvested area into the seven constituent categories and additionally using the yield information together with the calorie, protein and fat content of a crop (Supplementary Table2), the production in these three units and for the seven utilization categories for the crop determined. The process is repeated for all ten crops (annually for each nation; rarely, a nation harvests all ten crops, for example, China). Thus at the grid-cell level, we get the total harvested areas and total production (in units of kcal, kg protein and kg fat) per country and each year for each of the seven sectors. From these two pieces of information, yield can be computed. Not only do the utilization fractions change with time, but also the location and amount of the individual crop harvest, leading to a pattern developing of where crops are harvested for seven different utilizations. There are multiple sources of uncertainty: (1) we used only the top ten global crops in this study due to the limitation on temporally varying high-resolution gridded crop data to just ten crops; if the information of additional crops is added, the accuracy will increase. (2) We applied the computed national-level crop fractional utilization at subnational scales. At present, there is no globally available information on subnational-level crop utilization across nations (either due to privacy concerns or record-keeping was not possible). It is unlikely that such information will ever become available globally. Map accuracy can subjectively improve if country experts provide judgements on subnational crop utilization. Broadly, however, the utilizations agree with expected patterns in major countries such as the United States and Brazil. Further, food crop harvests are concentrated in the low-income country that may partly explain lower food crop yields at the global scale. (3) The sum of the total of the seven types of crop utilization: food, feed, processing, export, industrial, seed and losses within a country is equated to the within-country annual crop production after adjusting with imports and stock changes. Equating the seven-sector total crop utilization to this adjusted crop production assumes identical proportional contribution to the seven sectors of crop utilization, from crop production, imports and stock changes. Distortions in the maps are then likely in import-dependent nations, but such nations also have less within-country crop production (often zero), reducing mapping errors (stock changes ~ zero in the long term). (4) There is uncertainty in both the FAO and the gridded crop data. (5) For conversion of production to kcal, kg protein and kg fat, we used a static conversion factor globally (Supplementary Table2). (6) Countries with dominant crops other than the top ten global crops will have larger map errors. (7) Exported crops are variously used within importing nations, but if an imported crop gets re-exported by the importing nation, it creates map errors.\nFor global-scale yield computation shown in Fig.1, we used the total grid cell-level harvested hectares and production information in calories, protein and fat per sector and summarized across all grid cells with long-term data globally. The utilization sector-specific yield was then the ratio of the total global production and the total global hectares harvested in that sector. When the production was measured in kcal, the yield was in units of kcal\u2009ha\u22121per year, and in a similar way, when in units of kg protein and kg fat harvested, the yield was in units of kg protein\u2009ha\u22121per year and kg fat\u2009ha\u22121per year, respectively.\nWe used the past 20 years\u2019 data (1994 to 2013) and fitted a linear model for projection. We tested the significance of the model\u2019s slope using a two-sidedt-test at the 5% significance level. We also tested for normality in the residuals and white noise error. We conducted Lilliefor\u2019s two-sided test of the NULL hypothesis for normality conditions that the residuals were normally distributed against the alternative at the 5% level (rejection of the NULL indicates a non-normal distribution of the residuals). For white noise error in the residuals, we conducted the Ljung\u2013BoxQtest for residual autocorrelation (NULL hypothesis: there is no autocorrelation in the residual; rejection of the NULL at the 5% level indicates autocorrelation). Rarely were the conditions violated (Supplementary Table3). Non-normal residuals and autocorrelation in residuals are indicative of a lack of a good fit. In that case, an alternate model can be explored. The actual slope and its significance level are given in Table1. When thet-test was not significant, we assumed an intercept-only model (for example, feed harvested ha trend in panel a\u2014R2is only 0.03 for a linear model in this case; Supplementary Table3). Models thus selected were projected out linearly to the year 2030. Nonlinearity in the model parameters is a major challenge, and while using higher-order terms can lead to better model fits, they can also lead to acceleration due to higher-order terms and unreliable extrapolations. The linear projection is a prescribed scenario and, further, it is based on current locations of a crop that may change in the projected period. Yield growth rates could also be changed due to climate change16,35,36affecting the results of the study. We restricted to using the 1994 to 2013 data as the gridded data, and the FAO FBS data ends in 2013. Though more recent FBS data are now available, they are built using a different methodology and are for only a few years. As such, they do not allow for the merging of the two FBS datasets. Construction of the gridded data also lags as they are built based on local surveys of agricultural production that have delayed reporting, and the gridded data that we used represents the most up-to-date high-resolution time-series data on a wide range of global crops. For example, for two similar (but not time series) gridded crop data (MapSPAM (https:\/\/www.mapspam.info\/) and GAEZ (https:\/\/gaez.fao.org\/pages\/theme-details-theme-5)), the latest year of gridded crop data is circa 2010.\nTo plot Fig.2, we first determined the average harvested hectares in each period\/panel (1964 to 1968, 2009 to 2013) in each of the seven categories for all crops per grid cell. Then we determined the total, across all utilizations, and then the fraction of the total in each category (0\u20131) per grid cell. Each category is coloured in a solid colour with intensity ranging from 0% opaque (at 0 fraction) to 100% opaque (at 1 fraction). For example, the food category is in green and the export category is in brown colour. All seven categories are overlaid in the same sequence as the legend. The same process in colour coding was used in Fig.3aand Supplementary Figs.1and2.\nThe number of global undernourished people (2014\u20132016 to 2018\u20132020 average) reported by the FAO37was 633.98 million. We assume that in 2030, the number of the undernourished will be 656.8 million, as projected in the latest FAO report on the state of global food security38. In this report, country-specific undernourished numbers for 2030 are not available. To understand the requirement of calories to overcome undernourishment and population change in 2030 per country, we scale each country\u2019s current number of undernourished population with 656.8\/633.98. Scaling thus assumes that all undernourished countries will make the same identical progress between now and 2030, which is a scenario.\nWe explored 15 other potential scenarios using three different periods of country-wise undernourished information: (1) the entire undernourished population (19 years; 2000\u20132002 to 2018\u20132020); (2) ten years before and including the latest year (2009\u20132011 to 2018\u20132020); and (3) five years before and including the latest year (2014\u20132016 to 2018\u20132020). First, we note that undernourished population numbers have high inter-annual variability and thus are not easy to model. Sometimes the entire 19-year data appear visually erratic, while at other times only sections of the data, such as the latest ten years or the latest five years of data, appear erratic. We fit the observed undernourished data as linear trends and project the (linear) trends forward to 2030. When the linear fit is not significant at theP=\u20090.05 level, we default to the 2014\u20132016 to 2018\u20132020 average undernourished population in the country. We studied more scenarios using the past five years of the observations as we felt that it was more likely that recent progress will continue. However, fitting with fewer data points also resulted in fewer significant linear model fits. We find that at the lower limit, the shortfall in calories in undernourished countries as ~587.2 trillion kcal per year based on the MDER level of nutrition requirement in 2030 and ~880.7 trillion kcal per year based on the more realistic ADER level of nutrition requirement in 2030 (Supplementary Data3). On the higher end, the numbers were ~1,269.3 and ~1,755.6 trillion kcal per year shortfall based on the MDER and ADER level of nutrition requirement in 2030 (Supplementary Data3).\nReducing crop yield gaps39,40,41is one of many ways to reduce the undernourished population (others include better access to food, reducing civil strife42and climate change impact planning based on predictions35,36). While there are many studies on the existence and closing of yield gaps, we do not explore them here and instead directly deal with the scenarios of reducing the undernourished population (that may stem from closing yield gaps among many other levers that control undernourishment). Of particular use would be studies that measure the change in yield gaps over time, because yield gaps are a dynamic function of both the production at the location in question and the ceiling against which it\u2019s being compared. Yield gap studies that compare against static ceilings miss an important component of these trends.\nNote that even though we queried the FAO database for all the countries for undernourished population, several potential current countries with undernourished populations, such as Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Niger, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe, were not returned from our search. Because we scale each country by global ratios, these countries are implicitly included but could not be reported at the individual country level. Thus our global-scale totals in Supplementary Data2for the calories required for the undernourished in 2030 is an underestimate, and in Fig.3b,c, such countries are not reported as having a shortfall in calories for the undernourished. Generally, these countries are unable to harvest enough calories to feed their increased population and thus it is very likely that they will be unable to meet the demand of undernourished, but we do not have the undernourished numbers to project for 2030. We used the latest MDER and ADER values (year 2020) as those for 2030 (MDER and ADER values do not change much, and in most countries, we did not find trends that could be expressed simply, making any projection unreliable).\nThe FAO FBS and crop data are from sources given in citations 1 and 16, respectively.

Limited land resources, climate change and yield stagnation during recent years have once again raised concerns about the capacity of the region to remain as a large net exporter. Here we use a modelling approach to map rice yield gaps and assess production potential and net exports by 2040. We find that the average yield gap represents 48% of the yield potential estimate for the region, but there are substantial differences among countries. Exploitable yield gaps are relatively large in Cambodia, Myanmar, Philippines and Thailand but comparably smaller in Indonesia and Vietnam. Continuation of current yield trends will not allow Indonesia and Philippines to meet their domestic rice demand. In contrast, closing the exploitable yield gap by half would drastically reduce the need for rice imports with an aggregated annual rice surplus of 54 million tons available for export. Our study provides insights for increasing regional production on existing cropland by narrowing existing yield gaps.\nSoutheast Asia has made remarkable progress in raising rice production over the past 50 years, mainly by increasing cropping intensity (that is, the number of crops grown on the same piece of land during a 12-month period) and average yield1,2. As a result, the rice systems located in the river basins and deltas of this region now produce a large and stable surplus of rice that not only meets the regional demand but also makes a substantial contribution to global food supply1,3,4. As a whole, the region accounts for 26% and 40% of global rice production and exports3, respectively, being a major rice supplier for other regions of the world such as Africa and the Middle East5. Given the projected 30% increase in global rice demand by 2050, the continuing rise in rice trade and the limited scope available for other main rice-producing countries (for example, China and India) to generate a rice surplus2,6,7, Southeast Asia will continue to play a critical role in ensuring global rice supply8.\nThe new millennium has brought a number of challenges to rice systems in Southeast Asia. First, despite global equilibrium models on food supply and demand previously predicting an abrupt decline in rice demand per capita9, we now know that this parameter will remain relatively stable for most countries7,10. Hence, by 2050, rice demand in Southeast Asia will increase by approximately 18% simply due to population growth3,7,10. Second, the two most populous countries in the region (Indonesia and Philippines), totalling nearly 380 million people, depend on rice imports to meet their domestic demand. Third, after a few decades of a steady increase in average rice yield, there is now evidence of yield stagnation in four of the six major rice-producing countries in Southeast Asia region (Indonesia, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam) (Fig.1aand Supplementary Table1). Finally, the rice harvested area has remained stable or even declined slightly in some countries recently (Fig.1b) and is under growing threat of conversion for residential and industrial uses11. Meanwhile, irrigated rice-area expansion is unlikely to occur due to lack of investments in irrigation infrastructure, physical and economic water scarcity and environmental concerns12. Additionally, there is limited scope for further increasing cropping intensity, considering that two and up to three rice crops are now being grown in most of the rice systems in the region13(Supplementary Fig.1). Although it has been demonstrated that rice yields can be maintained in such intensive monoculture systems, it has also proven to be very difficult to raise them further, even with the best available varieties and technologies14.\na,b, Panels show trends in average yield (a) and harvested area (b) for rice in six major rice-producing countries in Southeast Asia: Cambodia (CA), Indonesia (IN), Myanmar (MY), Philippines (PH), Thailand (TH) and Vietnam (VN) during the past 30 years (1990\u20132019). Fitted linear or linear-plateau models are shown in Supplementary Table1. Data from FAOSTAT3, provided in Source Data Fig. 1.\nSource data\nOver the past decades, through renewed efforts, countries in Southeast Asia were able to increase rice yields, and the region as a whole has continued to produce a large amount of rice that exceeded regional demand, allowing a rice surplus to be exported to other countries4. At issue is whether the region will be able to retain its title as a major global rice supplier in the context of increasing global and regional rice demand, yield stagnation and limited room for cropland expansion. Here we follow a data-intensive approach to estimate yield gaps (the difference between yield potential and average farmer yield,Methods) across the major rice-producing countries in the region to determine whether there is still sufficient potential for increasing production on existing land and provide insight on whether the region can remain a major global rice supplier.\nWe estimated yield gaps based on the simulated yield potential (irrigated crops) or water-limited yield potential (rainfed crops) across the six major rice-producing countries in Southeast Asia (Cambodia, Indonesia, Myanmar, Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam), which together account for 97% of total rice production in the region3. Our assessment included both irrigated and rainfed lowland rice systems, which roughly account for 98% of total rice production in these six countries13,15, while deep-water and upland rice were not included. For irrigated rice, our definition of yield potential assumed no water and nutrient limitations and the absence of weeds, pests and diseases. The same definition applied to rainfed rice except for the inclusion of water limitation as a factor influencing the yield potential. At a regional level, yield potential averaged 8.9\u2009Mg\u2009ha\u22121per crop, ranging from 5.5\u2009Mg\u2009ha\u22121per crop to 10.2\u2009Mg\u2009ha\u22121per crop across the 11 country\u2013water regime combinations included in our analysis (Fig.2). Variation in yield potential portrayed differences in water regime and climate, with the highest values observed in irrigated systems or favourable environments for rainfed lowland rice production such as Indonesia and Philippines. In contrast, average water-limited yield potential was the lowest (5.3\u2009Mg\u2009ha\u22121per crop) for less productive but high-value aromatic (jasmine) rice varieties grown in water-limited environments in Thailand (Supplementary Fig.2). The average annual yield potential in Southeast Asia was much higher in irrigated versus rainfed rice cropping systems because of higher seasonal yield potential in irrigated versus rainfed crops and because irrigation allowed production of two and up to three rice crop cycles within the same year, while most rainfed environments allowed cultivation of only a single rice crop (Fig.2and Supplementary Fig.1). Yield potential was also influenced by the difference in weather between crop seasons, with yield potential being approximately 10% higher during the dry season compared with the wet season due to higher solar radiation13(Supplementary Fig.3).\na\u2013d, Panels show average yield potential and water-limited yield potential for irrigated (a,c) and rainfed (b,d) rice, respectively, for the six major rice-producing countries in Southeast Asia: Cambodia (CA), Indonesia (IN), Myanmar (MY), Philippines (PH), Thailand (TH) and Vietnam (VN) on a per crop (a,b) and annual basis (c,d). Solid and empty portions of bars indicate the average farmer yield and the yield gap, respectively. Vertical lines above solid and empty bars indicate standard errors of the mean (n\u2009=\u20095). Values inside the empty portion of the bars indicate the average yield gap as percentage of yield potential (irrigated) or water-limited yield potential (rainfed). Also shown are the regional area-weighted averages of Southeast Asia (SEA) for each water regime. Data provided in Source Data Fig. 2.\nSource data\nAt the regional level, the average yield gap represented 48% of the potential (Fig.2). This value represented the average across countries, water regimes, crop sequences and soil types after weighting by their relative share of total rice area. However, average values hid substantial differences in yield gaps among water regimes and countries. For example, average yield gaps were 42% and 55% for irrigated and rainfed rice, respectively. While the previous analysis focused on the average yield gap, the cropping intensity was also important to determine the available room for increasing annual rice production. For example, despite irrigated rice having a smaller yield gap than rainfed rice, its annual yield gap was larger due to higher cropping intensity (7.5\u2009Mg\u2009ha\u22121per year versus 5.2\u2009Mg\u2009ha\u22121per year) (Fig.2). Regarding differences among countries, the yield gaps for irrigated rice were smaller in Indonesia and Vietnam (37\u201339%) than in Cambodia, Myanmar, Philippines and Thailand (51\u201360%). In the case of rainfed rice, Indonesia exhibited a relatively smaller yield gap (49%) compared with Cambodia, Myanmar, Philippines and Thailand (54\u201366%).\nOur analysis also identified regions at the subnational level with the largest opportunities for increasing rice yield and production. For example, the yield gap was larger in the Red River delta compared with that of the Mekong delta in Vietnam (46% versus 39%). In some cases, the magnitude of the yield gap was related to the previous history of intensification of rice production in the country. For example, in the case of Indonesia and Philippines, yield gaps were smaller in typical Green Revolution areas such as Java and Central Luzon, respectively, compared with other comparably newer rice-producing regions within these countries (Fig.3). Our analysis also identified differences in the magnitude of the yield gap between cropping seasons. For example, we found a 7\u201316% larger yield gap for irrigated rice grown during the dry versus wet season in Indonesia and Philippines, but this pattern was the opposite in the case of irrigated rice in Cambodia and Vietnam (Supplementary Fig.3).\na\u2013f, Panels show average farmer yield (a,b), yield potential (c,d), and yield gap (as a percentage of yield potential) (e,f) for irrigated (a,c,e) and rainfed (b,d,f) lowland rice for the six major rice-producing countries in Southeast Asia at the climate zone level. Other countries in Southeast Asia not included in our yield-gap analysis are shown in grey. Data provided in Source Data Fig. 3. The base map was applied without endorsement using data from the Database of Global Administrative Areas (https:\/\/gadm.org\/).\nSource data\nThe current average (2019\u20132020) rice self-sufficiency ratio (SSR) in the entire Southeast Asia region was 1.10, with an estimated surplus of 17 million tons (Mt) (Fig.4). However, there were contrasting patterns among countries with rice production largely exceeding domestic consumption in Thailand and Vietnam, while Indonesia and Philippines relied on rice imports (Fig.4, Supplementary Fig.4and Supplementary Table1). The latter two countries have struggled consistently to meet their rice demand from their own production and considering strong population growth and agro-climatic constraints8,16, this situation is not likely to change easily. The degree to which Southeast Asia can remain a net rice-exporting region in the future will ultimately depend upon changes in average yields and harvested area. Given the limited room for cropland expansion and cropping intensity, as one can infer from recent trajectories in harvested area (Fig.1), we focused here on investigating rice SSR and surplus for different scenarios of yield increase during the next 20 years, assuming that net harvested area remained unchanged. We investigated three scenarios: continuation of current yield trends (S1), full closure of the exploitable yield gap (S2) and half closure of the current exploitable yield gap (S3) (Fig.4). For the calculation of the exploitable yield gap, we assumed that achieving 80% of the yield potential for irrigated crops and 70% of the water-limited yield potential for rainfed crops was a reasonable goal for farmers with access to markets, inputs and extension services17,18,19. Such levels of productivity have also been consistently achieved in well-managed long-term experiments14.\na\u2013d, Panels show the rice SSR (a,b) and rice surplus (c,d) for the baseline (2019\u20132020) (a,c) and three scenarios of yield increase towards year 2040 (b,d): continuation of historical yield trends (S1, red), full closure of exploitable yield gap (S2, yellow) and half closure of exploitable yield gap (S3, green). Separate values are shown for each country: Cambodia (CA), Indonesia (IN), Myanmar (MY), Philippines (PH), Thailand (TH) and Vietnam (VN). Also shown are the aggregated values for the entire Southeast Asia (SEA) region (including six major rice-producing countries analysed in this study plus the other five countries located in this region as a whole,Methods). S3 is not shown for Cambodia as the current yield gain is adequate to achieve half closure of the exploitable yield gap by 2040. In (a,b), the horizontal dashed line shows SSR\u2009=\u20091 (that is, production equals demand) as a reference Data provided in Source Data Fig. 4.\nSource data\nAssuming current trends in rice yield remains unchanged until 2040 (S1), the Southeast Asia regional SSR will drop from the current 1.10 to 1.03, almost eliminating the rice surplus at a regional level and with Indonesia and Philippines failing to achieve rice self-sufficiency (Fig.4). In contrast, a scenario in which the exploitable yield gap is completely closed by 2040 (S2) would allow the six countries to be rice self sufficient, leading to a regional SSR of 1.55 and an aggregated rice surplus of 100\u2009Mt, which is approximately six times larger than the current value. Closing the exploitable yield gap would require much faster rates of annual yield gain, ranging from 79\u2009kg\u2009ha\u22121per year to 135\u2009kg\u2009ha\u22121per year across countries, which may be difficult to achieve for the entire region and within the short time frame (20 years). Hence, we explored a more realistic third scenario in which the exploitable yield gap is closed by half (S3). In this scenario, the Southeast Asia regional SSR would increase to 1.29 and almost triple the rice surplus up to 54\u2009Mt, allowing Indonesia to become self sufficient in rice and drastically reducing the need for rice imports in the Philippines. Achieving the level of yield-gap closure set as the target for S3 would require annual rates of yield gain ranging from 36\u2009kg\u2009ha\u22121to 67\u2009kg\u2009ha\u22121with the largest and smallest rates corresponding to Myanmar and Thailand, respectively.\nConcerns about rice shortages are not new in Southeast Asia. In the early 1960s, the threat of famine was a major driver for the Green Revolution that resulted in increased cropping intensity, higher yields, lower rice prices and greater food security throughout the region4,8. The initial step was a steep rise in the harvested rice area during the 1960s and 1970s. This was followed by a period of rapid yield increases in the decade from the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s due to nearly complete adoption of the first generations of the new rice varieties, associated increases in input use and other technology improvements3,8,20. Interestingly, while this initial Green Revolution period ended in the mid-1980s in Indonesia and Philippines, it steadily continued in Vietnam for several decades21. In the 1990s, concerns were raised about stagnating or even declining yields or total factor productivity in some of the most intensively cropped rice areas of Southeast Asia, reiterating the urgent need for closing existing yield gaps22. The concerns about rice shortages are back now. Our analysis shows that the Southeast Asia region will not be able to produce a large rice surplus in the future with the most recent rates of annual rice yield gains. Failure to increase yield on existing cropland area will drastically reduce the rice exports to other regions and the capacity of many countries in the region to achieve or sustain rice self-sufficiency. It also means that many countries in the region would need to rely on regional trade to meet their domestic rice demand, which in itself is not necessarily a disadvantage if rice market liberalization takes place23. Hence, although achieving rice self-sufficiency at the country level should not be taken as the ultimate goal, we note that reaching a reasonable level of SSR for key staple crops is desirable for countries with limited capacity to purchase and distribute large amounts of food imports24. Furthermore, for practically all Southeast Asian countries, rice is of strategic importance in terms of food security, political stability, economy and export potential.\nGovernments from many countries in Southeast Asia have made explicit their desire to secure stable food prices, completely avoid rice imports in the future and\/or increase income from exports25,26. Our analysis shows that this is possible but only for a scenario where large and strategic investments in agricultural policies, innovation and research and development help accelerate rates of yield gains so that the exploitable yield gap is narrowed down substantially within the next 20 years. We believe that this is feasible considering that current yield gaps in Southeast Asia are comparably larger than those in other rice-producing countries such as China and the United States27,28, especially in Cambodia, Myanmar, Philippines and Thailand where current yield gaps are 50\u201370% of yield potential. Also, we note that the required rates of annual yield gain to narrow down the exploitable yield gap by half are modest in relation to the historical yield gains observed over the past 30 years in these countries (Fig.1and Supplementary Table1). The importance of maintaining the capacity of Southeast Asia to produce a large rice surplus goes beyond the region as it can help reduce global price volatility and provide a stable and affordable rice supply to many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East8,20.\nOur estimated yield gaps are of similar magnitude to those reported by previous studies for specific countries or rice seasons in Southeast Asia29,30,31. However, the regional extent of our study, together with the level of detail in relation to spatial and temporal variation in yield gaps and specificity in terms of cropping systems is unique, providing a basis for prioritizing agricultural research and development and investments at regional, national and subnational levels32. These regional and seasonal differences in yield gaps would not have been detected using top-down modelling approaches that ignore the complexity and diversity of rice systems in Southeast Asia33. For example, while rainfed rice exhibits a larger yield gap, our study shows that closure of yield gaps in irrigated rice can lead to a larger impact on annual rice production due to higher cropping intensity. We note that our study did not include the negative potential impact of climate change on yield, which may reduce our estimates of rice production and add further pressure on yield-gap closure34. Climate change impacts on rice yields will require adaptation strategies to sustain yield growth against a backdrop of rising temperatures and seawater levels, which particularly affect the mega deltas of Southeast Asia35. However, climate change operates over longer time scales and its impact on rice yield trends are typically overwritten by agro-ecological, seasonal and management effects36. A previous study suggested that a global increase in temperature of 1\u2009\u00b0C is likely to reduce rice yield by an average of 3.3% globally37. However, there is also evidence that climate change would be comparably smaller during the first half of the century38with average global surface temperature increasing 0.3\u2009\u00b0C during the 2021\u20132040 period39. Hence, the magnitude of the impact of climate change on yield potential by 2040 is relatively small compared with the size of the yield gap reported in our study. Likewise, we also note that the effect of climate change on crops will depend not only on temperature but also other variables including precipitation and atmospheric CO2concentration, together posing a large uncertainty of the ultimate impact on rice yield potential40,41,42. It is also reasonable to assume that numerous adaptation measures will allow farmers to adapt their cropping systems and practices to a changing climate. Therefore, we believe it is reasonable to ignore the effect of climate change on rice production for our assessment considering our relatively short time frame (20 years) and the challenges in modelling changes in yield and crop management as determined by climate change17,43.\nOur estimated yield potential was similar to that reported in previous studies. For example, the range of yield potential for irrigated rice reported here, from 9.5\u2009Mg\u2009ha\u22121per crop to 10.2\u2009Mg\u2009ha\u22121per crop, compared well with that of approximately 10\u2009Mg\u2009ha\u22121per crop reported for modern rice varieties in tropical environments44,45,46and with measured yields in well-managed field experiments in Philippines, Vietnam and Indonesia47,48,49. Likewise, our water-limited yield potential of 5.3\u2009Mg\u2009ha\u22121per crop for rainfed lowland aromatic rice was consistent with that reported for similar varieties in northeastern Thailand (5.3\u2009Mg\u2009ha\u22121per crop) and measured yields in field experiments, ranging from 5.1\u2009Mg\u2009ha\u22121per crop to 5.5\u2009Mg\u2009ha\u22121per crop50,51,52. Our study does not consider the improvement in genetic rice yield potential over time48,53, including adaptation to rising temperatures or more frequent droughts or floods. However, we are cautious about the associated timeline and potential impact. For example, we note that the yield potential of inbred rice varieties has not changed substantially over the past 65 years48,53. Similarly, efforts to achieve a step change in rice yield potential by incorporating a C4photosynthetic pathway will not lead to any commercially available variety in the near future (if ever)54. In the case of hybrid rice, which can produce 15\u201320% higher yield than inbred rice55, we note that its adoption has been limited in Southeast Asia (less than 5% of regional harvested area) due to high seed prices and trade-offs with grain quality56,57. Even when yield potential can be increased, increasing production would still require continuous agronomic improvements to exploit the resulting larger yield gap. Finally, we recognize that besides yield-gap closure, there may be other opportunities to increase the total milled rice output, for example, by reducing harvest and post-harvest losses and improving milling rates58.\nIn terms of the required interventions that are needed to close the current yield gap, improving crop management practices, especially nutrient and water management, and control of biotic factors are likely to play a central role22,25,59,60. Production risk is also important for prioritizing agricultural research and development. This is particularly the case of rainfed lowland rice, which accounts for nearly one-third of harvested rice area in Southeast Asia14, where uncertainty in rainfall (either too much or too little) makes farmers reluctant to adopt improved crop management technologies and use external inputs such as fertilizers and pesticides13,59. Use of pumps and crop insurance can help these farmers to deal with inherently higher risk of growing rice in rainfed lowland environments. Closing of these gaps requires not only fine tuning of crop management but also the concerted effort of policymakers, researchers and extension services to facilitate farmers\u2019 access to technologies, information and markets. It is also important to recognize a number of challenges in achieving this next and greener \u2018Green Revolution\u2019 for rice in Southeast Asia. The first challenge is how to foster yield increases without substantial trade-offs in grain quality, which might limit rice acceptance in local and global markets, which is of critical importance for export countries such as Thailand and Vietnam8,20. Another challenge is how to increase yield while minimizing the negative environmental impact associated with intensive rice production35. We believe a number of lessons can be learned from the past. For example, we know now that knowledge-based site-specific nutrient management can help tailor nutrient management to each environment, helping to increase yield and farmer profits while reducing nutrient losses22,61. Likewise, integrated pest management is a knowledge-intensive but valuable approach if applied correctly and holistically to reduce yield losses to weeds, pests and diseases while minimizing excessive use of pesticides and associated risks to the environment and people62. While fluctuation in input and grain prices may influence producers\u2019 access to yield-enhancing technologies and practices, we note that the projected increase in global demand together with the strong desire of governments in Southeast Asia to avoid rice imports and\/or increase rice exports will help maintain a favourable grain-to-input-price ratio in the foreseen future63,64,65. It can be argued that rearrangement of crop sequence in terms of sowing and harvest windows can also be explored as a way to increase productivity. We note, however, that farmers are often restricted in how they can allocate labour, time and resources within their socio-economic context, which may limit reconfiguration of current crop sequences66. Regardless of the means to achieve this next and greener \u2018Green Revolution\u2019, we note that failure to do it will not only cause political instability but also put additional pressure on land and water resources, thus risking further encroachment into natural ecosystems such as forests and wetlands20,26,35.\nThe six major rice-producing countries in Southeast Asia were selected for our analysis: Cambodia, Indonesia, Myanmar, Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam (Supplementary Table2). Altogether, these countries account for 97% of total harvested rice area and production in Southeast Asia3. Rice cropping systems were diverse across Southeast Asia, including different ecosystems (lowland and upland), water regimes (rainfed and irrigated) and cropping intensity (single, double and triple)13. Here we focused on irrigated rice and rainfed lowland rice production. Only irrigated rice was considered for Vietnam as rainfed rice production was small. Similarly, we excluded rainfed upland rice and deep-water rice from our analysis as they account for only 3% of national rice production across our six selected rice-producing countries, and their contribution to national rice production has declined steadily over time14,19. Hence, our analysis included a total of 11 country\u2013water regime combinations.\nWe followed the protocols established by the Global Yield Gap Atlas (www.yieldgap.org) to estimate yield potential and yield gaps67,68. Following these protocols, a number of representative sites were selected and site-specific data on weather, soil and crop management and a well-validated crop simulation model (ORYZA version 3) were used to estimate yield potential (irrigated rice) and water-limited yield potential (rainfed lowland rice)69. In relation to site selection, we first used the Spatial Production Allocation Model map (SPAM 2010;www.mapspam.info) together with expert opinion from local researchers to identify the spatial distribution of the rice harvest area in each country separately for each of the 11 country\u2013water regime combinations (Supplementary Information Text Section2and Supplementary Fig.5). Second, based on the current distribution of meteorological stations, we selected reference weather stations (RWS) for each country\u2013water regime combination. In each country, climate zones accounting for >5% of total harvested rice area for each water regime were identified. Each climate zone represented a specific combination of annual growing-degree days, water balance and temperature seasonality68. Circular buffer zones with a 100\u2009km radius were created around each RWS and clipped by the climate zones where the RWS was located in each country. For each country\u2013water regime combination, buffers were iteratively selected starting from the one with largest harvested rice area, avoiding the buffers that overlapped with the selected buffers by 20%. This process was repeated until the sum of rice coverage across selected buffers reached at least 50% of the national total harvested rice area for each water regime. In the case of Indonesia and rainfed rice in Thailand, we created eight and three additional buffers (also further referred to as RWS buffers), respectively, to cover the rice area in Indonesia and the important rainfed lowland rice-producing area in northeastern Thailand that were not included due to the lack of meteorological stations. As a result, a total of 69 and 61 RWS buffers were selected for irrigated and rainfed lowland rice in the six selected rice-producing countries, respectively (Supplementary Information Text Section2and Supplementary Table3).\nLong-term measured daily weather data were required for robust estimation of yield potential and its variability. Simulation of yield potential for irrigated rice required solar radiation and maximum and minimum temperature, and in the case of rainfed rice, precipitation and relative humidity were also needed. Daily measured data from the most recent ten years were available for the selected RWS buffers in our study except for the additional 11 buffers created for Thailand and Indonesia (Supplementary Information Text Section3and Supplementary Table4). For these 11 sites, we used gridded data from the NASA-POWER Agro-climatic database70. Following Van Wart et al.71and Grassini et al.34, both measured and gridded weather data used in this study were subjected to quality control measures to fill in missing data and\/or identify and correct erroneous values.\nFor irrigated rice, soil properties were not specified as yield potential is not influenced by soil properties, that is water and nutrient supply were not considered limiting for plant growth69,72. In the case of rainfed rice, simulation of water-limited yield potential required specification of soil properties related to the soil\u2013water balance, including water holding capacity, soil depth and water table depth69. In our study, default soil parameters from PADDYIN (a soil template file included in ORYZA version 3) for a clay soil were applied to simulate water-limited yield potential for rainfed lowland rice in Indonesia, Myanmar, and Philippines. However, soil parameters were modified for our simulations of water-limited yield potential for rainfed lowland rice in northern and northeastern Thailand to portray the coarse-texture soils that prevail in these regions73,74,75. In the case of Cambodia, separate simulations of water-limited yield potential for rainfed lowland rice were performed for clay and coarse-texture soils as these two soil types were important in the rice-growing area in Cambodia76.\nThe dominant rice cropping systems were identified in the major rice-producing regions in each country. A rice cropping system was defined as a unique combination of ecosystem (lowland, upland), water regime (irrigated, rainfed) and rice cropping intensity (single, double, triple) as defined by the number, type,and temporal cycle of crops planted on the same piece of land over a 12-month period. As such, a total of 182 RWS buffer\u2013cropping system combinations were identified in our study. For simulating yield potential, information on crop management including water regime, crop establishment method, sowing or transplanting window, maturity window, probability of drought and rice variety name were collected for each rice cycle in each cropping system via structured questionnaires completed by local agronomists and extension personnel in each country (Supplementary Information Text Section4). Selected crop calendars for typical rice cropping systems in each country were shown in Supplementary Fig.1. Data on average farmer yields and rice harvested area were retrieved from official statistics at the regional\/state level for the most recent four years for Myanmar, at the regency administration level for the most recent six years for Indonesia and at the provincial level for at least the most recent five years for the other four countries (Supplementary Information Text Section4and Supplementary Table5). Data on farmer yield were adjusted to a standard moisture content of 140\u2009g\u2009H2O\u2009kg\u22121rice grain.\nYield potential (irrigated rice) and water-limited yield potential (rainfed lowland rice) were simulated using the crop growth and development model ORYZA version 3 and data on actual crop management, measured daily weather, soil characteristics and characteristics of representative rice varieties69. This model has been well validated in field experiments established in a wide range of environments and extensively used to simulate yield potential in various rice cropping systems worldwide77,78,79,80. To the extent that it was possible, we attempted to simulate modern rice varieties with broad adaptability that represented varieties widely grown in each of the six countries as determined based on expert opinion and national reports77,81,82,83. These varieties included Inpari 32 (Indonesia), OM1490 (Vietnam and Cambodia), PSBRc80 (Philippines) and PSBRc10 (Myanmar). An exception was the aromatic (jasmine) rice variety KDML105, which was used for simulation of water-limited yield potential in the rainfed lowland rice environment in northeastern Thailand as these types of variety prevailed in this region. Genetic coefficients of Inpari 32 were obtained from Agustiani et al.77, and crop parameters of OM1490, PSBRc80 and PSBRc10 were retrieved from Li et al.84. Briefly, the calibration and validation of the crop model in these previous studies were conducted with two independent datasets using measured data collected from well-managed field experiments. Genetic parameters were derived through iterating calibration and validation processes with initial values of crop parameters obtained from a well-characterized variety, IR72. Unfortunately, experimental data from well-managed crops were not available to calibrate model parameters for aromatic rice varieties. Hence, parameters of KDML105 were derived by using the crop parameters from OM1490 as initial values and subsequent addition of photoperiod sensitivity and lower partitioning to grain so that the simulated harvest index was around 0.40. These adjustments in model parameters for aromatic rice were based on previously published studies for aromatic rice in northeastern Thailand and elsewhere31,74,85,86.\nWe simulated the yield potential (or water-limited yield potential in the case of rainfed lowland rice) for each rice cycle within each dominant cropping system for each of the RWS buffers selected for the 11 country\u2013water regime combinations. For irrigated rice, we assumed no water limitation, while simulation of rainfed lowland rice considered precipitation, vapour pressure and soil properties influencing the soil\u2013water balance, including soil texture and groundwater depth. For rainfed lowland rice, there was high uncertainty in relation to groundwater depth across sites, seasons and landscapes and its influence on rice yields87. Given the range of possible scenarios and associated uncertainties, we simulated water-limited yield potential for rainfed lowland rice for different scenarios of groundwater depth during the entire crop cycle (shallow, medium and deep). These three scenarios basically portrayed no water limitation (shallow), moderate-drought (medium) and drought-prone (deep) environments (Supplementary Information Text Section5). A sensitivity analysis was performed for two selected locations with different degrees of water limitation to understand the impact of soil texture and groundwater depth on water-limited yield potential (Supplementary Fig.6).\nFor each rice cycle, the yield gap was calculated as the difference between yield potential (irrigated rice) or water-limited yield potential (rainfed lowland rice) and average farmer yield18. Average yield gap for each RWS was estimated by weighting yield potential and average yield based on the fraction of rice harvested area within each buffer accounted for by each cropping sequence\u2013crop cycle combination. The annual yield gap was calculated based on the average rice cropping intensity in each RWS. In all cases, the yield gap was estimated separately for each country\u2013water regime combination.\nCurrent (2019\u20132020) annual domestic rice demand was set as a baseline in our study. Current national rice demand in each of the six selected major rice-producing countries was estimated as the average annual national rice production, imports, exports and stock change during 2019\u2013202088(Supplementary Table6). Future (2040) rice demand for each country was estimated by multiplying the projected population derived from the medium fertility variant (https:\/\/population.un.org\/wpp\/) by the per capita rice demand by year 2040. The latter was estimated based on the relative change in average per capita rice demand between the baseline (2019\u20132020) and year 2040 derived for each country from the outputs of three econometric food supply\u2013demand models: the International Rice Research Institute Global Rice Model89, the International Model for Policy Analysis of Agricultural Commodities and Trade model10and the Rice Economy Climate Change model90(Supplementary Table6). Projected total rice demand by year 2040 is expected to be higher than the current (2019\u20132020) demand for all countries except for Thailand and Vietnam where it will remain relatively similar. In this study, we also analysed total rice demand and production at the regional level by considering all 11 countries in Southeast Asia, that is, the six selected major rice-producing countries included in this study plus other five countries: Brunei, Laos, Malaysia, Singapore and Timor-Leste91. To do this, current rice demand in all of Southeast Asia was estimated as the average of annual regional total rice production, import, export and stock variation (average of 2019\u20132020)88. We noted that the five countries not included in our analysis (Brunei, Laos, Malaysia, Singapore and Timor-Leste) are net rice importers and their aggregated annual rice demand represents 5% of that calculated for the six countries selected for our study88. Hence, future (2040) total rice demand in Southeast Asia was estimated by multiplying the projected rice demand from the six countries by 1.05. In our study, all rice yield, production, per capita rice demand and total rice demand were reported as paddy rice at a standard moisture content of 140\u2009g\u2009H2O\u2009kg\u22121rice grain. We noted that per capita rice demand was converted to paddy rice by dividing originally reported milled rice from the US Department of Agriculture databases and the three models by rice milling rate of each major rice-producing country10,88,89,90(Supplementary Table6).\nWe assessed rice production potential and its impact on rice surplus by comparing the projected rice production against rice demand by 204017,18,19. We performed scenario analyses individually at the national level for the six selected major rice-producing countries and separately for the entire Southeast Asia. Similar to other studies assessing food supply\u2013demand scenarios92,93, we used 2040 as the target year for our scenario assessment. A 20-year time span would be long enough to facilitate long-term policies, investments and technologies devoted to closing exploitable yield gap and it is short enough to minimize long-term effects from climate change on crop yields and cropping systems. Similarly, we noted that population growth rates will start to decline for the majority of the countries in Southeast Asia around or after 2040 (https:\/\/population.un.org\/wpp\/).\nReaching 80% of the yield potential (irrigated crops) or 70% of the water-limited yield potential (rainfed crops) is a reasonable yield goal for farmers with good access to markets, inputs and extension services as evidenced by rainfed wheat in Germany and France, rainfed maize in the United States and irrigated rice in Egypt and China18,94(www.yieldgap.org). Hence, the exploitable yield gap was defined here as the difference between 80% of yield potential (irrigated) or 70% of water-limited yield potential (rainfed) and current average farmer yield. For our scenario assessment, we considered three scenarios of yield-gap closure. The first scenario was business as usual (S1), that is, continuation of current yield trends based on most recent rates of yield gains as derived from our analysis (Fig.1and Supplementary Table1). To quantify the available scope for increasing rice production on existing harvested rice area, the second scenario (S2) assumed full closure of the exploitable yield gap between now and 2040 so that average yield reached the attainable yield for white rice, ranging from 7.6\u2009Mg\u2009ha\u22121per crop to 8.2\u2009Mg\u2009ha\u22121per crop (irrigated) and 5.5\u2009Mg\u2009ha\u22121per crop to 6.5\u2009Mg\u2009ha\u22121per crop (rainfed lowland) across countries and 3.7\u2009Mg\u2009ha\u22121per crop in the case of rainfed lowland aromatic rice in Thailand (Fig.2and Supplementary Fig.2). Because it is difficult to achieve full closure of the exploitable yield gap for the entire population of rice farmers in Southeast Asia in only 20 years, we explored a more realistic third scenario (S3) that assumed 50% closure of the existing exploitable yield gap by 2040.\nWe assumed that the current harvested rice area remained unchanged for all three scenarios, which was reasonable considering the flat trajectories in harvested area over past decades. Indeed, our assumption can be considered optimistic considering current pressure on converting lowland rice fields for urban and industrial uses or diversifying into other crops95. We also assumed no change in upland rice production, which currently accounted for less than 3% of national production across the six countries, although its area may decline further over time. We also assumed no change in the fraction of irrigated rice area, given lack of investments for irrigation schemes, physical and economic water scarcity and environmental concerns12. At a regional level of Southeast Asia, total rice production was estimated as the sum of projected rice production from the six selected rice-producing countries and that from the other five countries in each of the three scenarios. We assumed that rice production in the other five countries remained unchanged (in relative terms), which totalled an annual average of 5.6\u2009Mt from 2019 to 2020, representing 3% of rice production in the six selected countries88. We noted that for the current baseline and for each of the three scenarios by 2040, we calculated the aggregated rice production, rice surplus and the SSR. Rice surplus and SSR were estimated as the difference and ratio between annual rice production and annual rice demand, respectively17(Fig.4).\nFurther information on research design is available in theNature Research Reporting Summarylinked to this article.\nData on yield potential from the Global Yield Gap Atlas are available atwww.yieldgap.org.

Here we propose a new method to assess long-term (LT) regional sustainable nitrogen inputs. The core is a novel scaled response function between normalized yield and total net nitrogen input. The function was derived from 25 LT field trials for wheat, maize and barley in Europe, Asia and North America and is fitted by a second-order polynomial (R2=\u20090.82). Using response functions derived from common short-term field trials, with soil nitrogen not in steady state, gives the risks of soil nitrogen depletion or nitrogen pollution. The scaled LT curve implies that the total nitrogen input required to attain the maximum yield is independent of this maximum yield as postulated by Mitscherlich in 1924. This unique curve was incorporated into a simple economic model with valuation of externalities of nitrogen surplus as a function of regional per-capita gross domestic product. The resulting LT sustainable nitrogen inputs range from 150 to 200\u2009kgN\u2009ha\u22121and this interval narrows with increasing yield potential and decreasing gross domestic product. The adoption of LT response curves and external costs in cereals may have important implications for policies and application ceilings for nitrogen use in regional and global agriculture and ultimately the global distribution of cereal production.\nFinding a balance between the benefits of nitrogen fertilizer use for food production and the impacts of agricultural nitrogen pollution on human health and ecosystems is a challenge from the regional to the global scale1,2. Current global anthropogenic addition of new nitrogen from the Haber\u2013Bosch process, cultivation of nitrogen-fixing crops and combustion of fossil fuels more than doubles the natural input of reactive nitrogen3, thereby exceeding the assumed planetary boundary of nitrogen4and causing high environmental costs3,5. The use of synthetic fertilizers and manures across the nearly 40% of Earth\u2019s ice-free land devoted to agriculture6comprises the largest source of ammonia, nitrate and nitrous oxide pollution globally, with severe impacts on ecosystems, human health and climate change3,7.\nA pivotal relationship for improving the agronomic and environmental performance of food systems is the response of crop yield to addition of nitrogen fertilizer. This relationship sets the yield increase per unit of fertilizer input (known as the agronomic efficiency (AE)) and is the basis for estimating nitrogen surplus and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE, the ratio of nitrogen removed by crops to nitrogen input8). The nitrogen response curve, together with prices for crops and nitrogen fertilizers, informs farmers about how much nitrogen fertilizer they need to apply in a given year to obtain the most profitable crop yield, and informs strategies for developing regions to achieve food security without depleting soil nitrogen9,10. In today\u2019s increasingly globalized agricultural markets, profit margins for most crops are narrow and farmers struggle to achieve a consistent return on investment11,12. Proper management of nutrient resources is a relevant factor in this quest, but the societal costs of nitrogen pollution are only rarely incorporated into economic decisions for farming. Establishing policies that promote societally optimal nitrogen rates, often substantially lower than optimal rates for private economic returns13,14, also relies upon accurate characterization of nitrogen\u2013yield responses.\nLong-term field experiments (LTEs) are essential to quantify the nitrogen response for assessment of economic and environmental performance of alternative nutrient management practices15,16,17, because the time to establish steady state between nitrogen input, crop yield, nitrogen losses and the soil nitrogen pool can exceed decades, depending on soil organic matter fraction and quality (for example, C\/N ratio) and the history of fertilizer use15. Although numerous short-term experiments (STEs; single-year trials) are carried out across the globe to inform extension activities, LTEs represent a substantial investment of research time and resources, and are therefore scarce for areas such as Latin America and Africa18. STEs can inform yearly management decisions but they cannot correctly characterize the long-term impacts, and associated costs and benefits, of changing nitrogen management policies. Improved understanding of LT nitrogen response functions across regions is critically needed and here we address this knowledge gap.\nDrawing upon the generic principles governing nitrogen transformations and uptake when nitrogen input, crop yield and soil nitrogen pools are in near steady state, in this article we propose a generic LT nitrogen response relationship for cereals that can be used to inform policy decisions. We focus on the three major global staple cereals, wheat (16% of global crop area for 2013\u2013201719), maize (14%), barley (3.4%), and also address lowland rice (12.5%). We collect and analyse a global set of LTEs for Europe, North America and Asia, and use the Broadbalk long-term wheat experiment in the United Kingdom (which began in 1843)20to establish a conceptual model describing the differences between ST and LT nitrogen responses.\nOver the past 175 years the combined effects of different amounts of nitrogen\u2013phosphorus\u2013potassium fertilization, use of manures, improved cultivars, pesticides, liming and fallowing has been demonstrated and explained by analysis of crop and soil characteristics in the Broadbalk LTE (Rothamsted, UK)20. The LT response of wheat in rotation (Fig.1) was taken from observations in the Broadbalk experiment from 1985 to 2018, where plots were given the same annual nitrogen fertilizer rate (nitrogen rate) every year21. This LT response was compared to the ST (first year after adjustment of nitrogen rate) response at commercial wheat trials in different parts of England between 1994 and 1998 (Supplementary Note2).\nThe LT nitrogen response as observed in the Broadbalk LTE (N=\u2009245,R2=\u20090.84) and the common first-year nitrogen response for representative commercial sites in different parts of the United Kingdom (N=\u2009105,R2=\u20090.55). Dashed lines, 95% confidence intervals. See also Supplementary Note3.\nSource data\nGrain yield at zero nitrogen input (Y0) for the commercial STEs (5.0\u2009t\u2009ha\u22121) is substantially higher than for the Broadbalk LTE (1.7\u2009t\u2009ha\u22121) because more nitrogen is available from fertilizer residues and mineralization of the soil organic matter and crop residues originating from previous higher fertilizer inputs. For LTEs such as Broadbalk, the mean net supply of nitrogen from the soil is low and the dominant nitrogen sources forY0are nitrogen deposition (DEP) and natural biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) from free-living bacteria. However, the mean maximum attainable yields (Ymax) for the LTEs and STEs both converge to 9.1\u2009t\u2009ha\u22121. TheYmaxfor LTEs for continuous wheat in the Broadbalk experiment is lower (Supplementary Note2).\nWith continued application of a certain nitrogen rate to soil-cropping systems, ST nitrogen response curves gradually shift to the LT nitrogen response (Fig.2). When the LT nitrogen rate is higher than the historic rate, grain yields will gradually increase due to soil nitrogen accumulation, causing increased soil nitrogen delivery through greater returns of mineralized nitrogen from nitrogen in roots and crop residues to the soil21,22, and an overall improved soil fertility and quality. When the LT nitrogen rate is lower than the historic rate, grain yields will gradually decrease due to soil nitrogen depletion causing decreased soil nitrogen delivery from mineralization. The first case typically applies to developing regions in Africa and south Asia where nitrogen rates are increased to meet the market demand or reduce regional food and feed insecurity; the second case applies to industrialized regions such as Europe where environmental policies restrict nitrogen fertilizer use to reduce nitrogen pollution23,24.\nST nitrogen response of wheat grain yields in the United Kingdom in a trial with a history of high nitrogen inputs (150\u2009kgN\u2009ha\u22121(ref.25); red line), and a ST nitrogen response in a trial with a history of low nitrogen inputs (60\u2009kgN\u2009ha\u22121; blue line), as compared to the LT generic nitrogen response where soil nitrogen is in steady state for all nitrogen inputs (dashed green line, Broadbalk LTE). As time passes, both ST responses will converge into the single LT response due to changes in soil status as indicated by the arrows. The dots with two colors (either green and blue or green and red) indicate a ST response which overlaps with the LT response when historic and current nitrogen rates are the same.\nGiven its long duration, the soil nitrogen and carbon status at every rate in the Broadbalk experiment is in near steady state with its constant annual nitrogen rate. Every observation year between 1985 and 2018 delivers a nitrogen response curve with its ownYmax, which ranges between 6 and 12\u2009t\u2009ha\u22121, and aY0ranging between 0.23 and 3.62\u2009t\u2009ha\u22121(Fig.3a). Differences inYmaxreflect differences in annual weather conditions and changes in cultivars (new cultivars were introduced in 1991 and 2013), whileY0is also affected by annual nitrogen mineralization.\na, Second-order polynomial fits of annual nitrogen response curves from unscaled observations and mean curve (red).b, Yields indexed to maximum annual yield and nitrogen rates per year of observation transformed to available nitrogen by adding estimates of non-fertilizer sources, and fitted with a second-order polynomial with zero intercept (equation (1), black dashed line).\nSource data\nWe hypothesize that the observed LT nitrogen response can be approximated with a single curve, which describes the relative (normalized) yield (Yr=Y\/Ymax=\u2009yield index) in steady state as a function of total available nitrogen (Nav).Navis defined as the sum of nitrogen from fertilizers and soil nitrogen supply, including atmospheric deposition (DEP) and biological fixation (BNF). The amount of available nitrogen from soil, DEP and BNF is referred to as SN, which governs crop production in unfertilized plots. This curve in Fig.3bwas derived by first scaling observed annual yields to the annualYmax, and then convertingNratetoNavby addition of SN (Supplementary Note 3). For each observation year, bothYmaxand SN were estimated from a second-order polynomial fit to the observations, where SN is the intercept on the horizontal axis. SN ranged between 4 and 64\u2009kgN\u2009ha\u22121. Mean SN is 30\u2009kgN\u2009ha\u22121and shows no trend in time; with a local DEP of 20\u2009kgN\u2009ha\u22121in 2017, this would suggest a BNF of 10\u2009kgN\u2009ha\u22121, which is in accordance with averages for the United Kingdom26. Finally, all scaled observations were fitted again with a second-order polynomial with zero intercept (Fig.3b). The resulting nitrogen response relationship for Broadbalk wheat in rotation is expressed by:\nThe same procedure was applied to observations for continuous wheat in the Broadbalk LTE and gives an almost identical quadratic yield response (R2=\u20090.903; Supplementary Note3). One LTE of relatively long duration (since 1961) for maize in Nebraska (United States) was comparable in set-up to Broadbalk (six nitrogen and three phosphorus rates)27. As for Broadbalk, the scaled annual nitrogen response data fit a quadratic function (R2=\u20090.934; see Supplementary Note4for details). On average,Yrat a givenNavfor maize in the United States is somewhat (11%) higher than for winter wheat in the United Kingdom, indicating that maize has a stronger nitrogen response than wheat. Maize is a C4 crop with nitrogen dilution different from that in C3 crops such as wheat28, causing the grain nitrogen content in maize to be somewhat lower (1.5% versus 1.9% (ref.29)). Furthermore, the harvest index of maize tends to be somewhat higher30.\nBack-transformation of the scaled curves to the nitrogen response curves, as needed to plan regional long-term nitrogen requirements for a certain cereal yield target, would require independent estimates of site-specific SN andYmax.\nWe next seek to examine whether the LT nitrogen response established in the Broadbalk LTE holds for other cereals in experiments around the globe. The transformations using individualYmaxand SN values that allowed coalescence of data from the respective years in the Broadbalk LTE into a single curve were also applicable to a set of 25 global LTEs for wheat, maize and barley in Europe, North America and Asia. These 25 LTEs cover a wide range of soils, climates and practices, with nitrogen rates ranging from 0 to 300\u2009kgN\u2009ha\u22121andYmaxfrom 2.8 to 12.8\u2009t\u2009ha\u22121(Table1and Fig.4a). The second-order polynomial fit of pooled scaled nitrogen response data for global cereals was:\nUnscaled (a) and scaled (b) LT nitrogen response data for wheat, barley and maize trials in Europe, North America and Asia and second-order polynomial fit with zero intercept, as compared to the fit for Broadbalk wheat in rotation.\nSource data\nThe maximum SN was 88\u2009kgN\u2009ha\u22121. The nitrogen response in equation (2) is very similar to Broadbalk wheat in rotation (equation (1) and Fig.4b), but somewhat steeper, which could be the effect of maize in the United States (Supplementary Note 4).\nDespite their empirical nature, models of the quadratic form\\(Y_{\\mathrm{r}}=(a \\times N_{\\mathrm{av}}^2) + (b \\times N_{\\mathrm{av}})\\)do satisfy some \u2018general principles of biology\u2019:\nRelative yield,Yr=\u20090 forNav=\u20090; in the long term there cannot be dry matter production (by photosynthesis) without nitrogen.\nThe law of diminishing returns; with increasing nitrogen inputs the internal nitrogen concentration increases and the dry matter production per unit of nitrogen input (AE) decreases; the quadratic coefficient represents the rate of diminishing returns.\nThe presence of anYmaxinduced by other negative feedbacks at high biomass or high tissue nitrogen concentrations; in cereals examples of such feedbacks are lodging or increased pest incidence.\nThe validity of the LT generic nitrogen response curve was verified by back-calculation of the original unscaled cereal grain yields for every LTE, using 25 alternative second-order polynomial fits of the dataset of indexed yield as a function ofNav, each time leaving out the observations for the validation site. The high correlation (0.945) between original and back-calculated yields (Supplementary Note6) and the low root mean square error of the prediction (0.52\u2009t\u2009ha\u22121) shows that our generic curve indeed represents the local nitrogen response of cereal yields across a wide range of soils and climates and suggests that it can be used as a first approach for regions where LT curves are not available, such as in Africa and Latin America, provided that local SN andYmaxare known. Because we found a similar scaled nitrogen response as that in the Broadbalk LTE for the 25 global LTEs,Ymaxcan signify either mean attainable yield over many years, or the attainable yield for a given year, depending on the purpose.\nIn general, fertilizer rates and practices in countries change slowly and hence soils can be expected to be in near-equilibrium with nitrogen rates. Therefore we sought confirmation of our generic LT response curve using national data on crop yields and nitrogen fertilizer use. Modelled yield responses in Europe corresponded well with national data for rain-fed wheat, barley and maize31(Ymaxat 90% ofYw;R2=\u20090.796; Supplementary Fig.10) and for wheat32(R\u00b2\u2009=\u20090.579; Supplementary Fig.11). In developing countries these national data are often absent or unreliable. As an alternative, we compared maize response in nine countries in sub-Saharan Africa10, using modelled nitrogen requirements for target yields according to the Global Yield Gap Atlas33, withYmaxset to 80% of water-limited yield potential (Yw). We found a reasonable fit (R2=\u20090.671; Supplementary Fig.12), although in this sub-Saharan Africa study the modelled nitrogen requirements were proportional toYmax, which is not the case in our generic response curve. The applicability of the generic curve for Africa was further verified against trial results in Niger and Malawi (Supplementary Figs.13\u201315).\nNotably, the LT generic nitrogen response curve seems not to be applicable for lowland rice. A first provisional scaled nitrogen response curve based on four LT trials for lowland rice in India and Nepal, with wheat as a winter crop as common in South Asia, showed a much weaker increase of yields withNav(Supplementary Note8) and noYmax, probably because of higher rates of non-symbiotic BNF as compared to wheat and maize34, high ammonia loss from urea fertilizers and redox conditions promoting denitrification, all factors weakening yield response to nitrogen fertilizer addition35,36.\nThe very close relation between absolute nitrogen rate and relative yield implies that the amount of fertilizer nitrogen required to produce, for example, 70% ofYmaxis fixed, that is, is independent of the value ofYmaxitself. This might be unexpected and is only possible if the conversion of fertilizer nitrogen into grain biomass becomes more efficient with risingYmax. The agronomic use efficiency of the applied nitrogen (AE\u2009=\u2009(Y\u2212Y0)\/Nrate) expresses the efficiency with which applied nitrogen is converted to grain yield37. The long-term AE is achieved when the soil nitrogen supply is in steady state with the annual input rate10, and can be estimated from LTEs. For the ensemble of 25 LTEs for wheat, maize and barley in Europe, North America and Asia, the AE was calculated for eachNrateand LTE and could be fitted accurately as a linear function ofY0,Ymax,Nrateand two interaction terms (equation (3) and Fig.5).\nAE increases withYmaxand decreases with increasingNrate(visualized with isolines of applied nitrogen fertilizer withY0set at the mean observed value in LTEs of 2.9\u2009t\u2009ha\u22121). Data points are unscaled observations for the 25 LTEs, with AE at observedNrateadjusted to the nearestNrateisoline using equation (3).\nSource data\nThis expression explains the positive impact ofYmaxand the negative impact of nitrogen rate on the NUE, the latter causing diminishing returns from nitrogen input (Fig.1). The positive impact ofYmaxexemplifies Liebscher\u2019s law38that the use efficiency of a yield-constraining factor (here nitrogen) increases as the other factors become more optimal (here expressed inYmax, which comprises genotype, weather, soil and crop husbandry factors). De Wit39demonstrated that Liebscher\u2019s law holds for nitrogen responses in various crops, and showed that it relies on higher efficiencies in both nitrogen uptake and conversion into grain, at higherYmax. Taken to its extreme, this law leads to Mitscherlich\u2019s assumption40that the activity coefficient for any nutrient in the exponent of his response function is independent of other factors. In the words by De Wit on Mitscherlich: \u2018This heroic assumption \u2026 implies that the absolute amount of nutrient needed to reach a certain fraction of the maximum yield is the same whether yields are low or high. Of course, such universal constants do not exist, but this does not exclude the possibility that constant activities manifest themselves in more restricted domains and yield ranges.\u2019 Our present analysis of LTE data indicates the existence of this (near) constancy of nitrogen requirement. We find that the nitrogen requirement to reachYmax(or a certain fraction thereof) is uncorrelated withYmaxitself.\nThe AE function in equation (3) can be converted to aYrrelation withNrate. AE models derived for STEs also approximate the long-term response when using low values ofY0(see Supplementary Note7for an example of an STE for maize in Nebraska). Global application of AE models for derivation of long-term sustainable nitrogen inputs requiresY0data, which are increasingly available but not for all regions. In addition,Y0depends on DEP, which changes over time. Regional SN, required for equation (2), is available from global models26.\nOur finding of a generic nitrogen response curve for wheat, maize and barley in Europe, the United States, South Asia and China, withYmaxranging between 2 and 13\u2009t\u2009ha\u22121, implies that theYmaxis attained in a fairly narrow range ofNav. ThisNavatYmax(referred to asNmax) is found by solving equation (2) for dY\/dNav=\u20090.Nmaxfor equation (1) was 234\u2009kgN\u2009ha\u22121, and the meanNmaxfor the 25 LTEs was 217\u2009kgN\u2009ha\u22121(s.d., 41\u2009kgN\u2009ha\u22121). The observed range ofNmaxacross the 25 sites is 143\u2013307\u2009kgN\u2009ha\u22121andNmaxis uncorrelated withYmax(R2=\u20090.055). This implies that AE (and also NUE) at given relative yieldYrincreases withYmax. One explanation for a highYmaxin a specific region or year is a good synchrony between crop nitrogen demand and nitrogen availability from soil and fertilizer41. This leads to high AE when nitrogen fertilizer rates are not excessive42(Fig.5). One could also reason that a highYmaxis the result of a favourable climate, crop physiology and crop\u2013soil system, including a well-functioning root system, allowing maximum interception and utilization of available nitrogen in addition to water and other nutrients.\nThe hypothesis of NUE increasing withYmaxcould only be tested for nitrogen trials in the Broadbalk LTE, where the nitrogen content of grain and straw were also measured (Supplementary Note9). For a nitrogen rate range of 144\u2013288\u2009kgN\u2009ha\u22121, similar to that givingYmaxfor global cereals, NUE increased substantially (R2=\u20090.166,N=\u200964), and almost proportionally withYmax, with an average NUE of 40% for anYmaxof 6\u2009t\u2009ha\u22121, increasing to 80% at 10\u2009t\u2009ha\u22121.\nFarmers need insight into the marginal response of yield to nitrogen rate to determine the economic optimal nitrogen rate (EONR43), which is lower thanNmaxdue to the cost of nitrogen fertilizer. Our EONR applies to the scale of national or regional cereal sectors. Marginal response depends on the time horizon of optimization and the choice of response curve. The net economic return is the gross return from crop sales minus the costs of labour, capital and nitrogen fertilizer inputs, and depends on prevailing prices of grain and nitrogen fertilizer. The nitrogen rate giving maximum financial return is a proxy for the mean optimal nitrogen rate for regional or national cereal farming. Taking into account the external cost of nitrogen pollution provides a proxy for the optimal nitrogen rate for society and provides guidance for fertilizer and nitrogen policies13,44.\nThe calculated range of nitrogen rates delivering a high net positive financial is reduced by: (1) using the ST nitrogen response, (2) using the LT nitrogen response and (3) including external costs. The corresponding ranges of nitrogen rates for price levels in the Netherlands, using ST and LT nitrogen response curves for wheat in rotation in the Broadbalk LTE, are: (1) 219\u2009kgN\u2009ha\u22121(range, 14\u2013233\u2009kgN\u2009ha\u22121), (2) decreasing to 157\u2009kgN\u2009ha\u22121(range, 61\u2013218\u2009kgN\u2009ha\u22121) and (3) decreasing further to 90\u2009kgN\u2009ha\u22121(range, 45\u2013135\u2009kgN\u2009ha\u22121) (Supplementary Note10). In other words, including the external costs will reduce the optimal nitrogen level by 40% in this case.\nFor global cereals, we variedYmaxfrom 2 to 12\u2009t\u2009ha\u22121and GDP from US$2,000 to US$50,000 per capita (Fig.6). The marginal costs of crop production and nitrogen pollution for countries are estimated using an income (GDP) elasticity of 0.85 (Supplementary Note11). The optimum nitrogen rate for farming profits increases with the maximum attainable yield. This increase is independent of GDP but depends on the prices of grain and fertilizer. In many regions with high market access, world market prices apply, but in some regions of the developing world, production and consumption of cereals are more controlled by local markets; for example in Kenya prices for wheat and nitrogen fertilizer are up to 1.5\u20132 times higher than in Europe and North America45. For economic analysis at a society scale we considered that the virtual price per kilogram of cereal on the \u2018food plate\u2019 is higher than at the farm gate. For this we ran scenarios with price ratios of 1 and 3. We did not account for feedback effects of reduced cereal supply on prices or for subsidies on cereal and fertilizer, although these are present in many regions; for example, nitrogen fertilizer subsidies are up to 70% of the world market price in India46.\nIncrease in societal optimal nitrogen rates for global cereals with increasing yield potential (Ymax; from 2 to 12\u2009t\u2009ha\u22121) and with decreasing GDP (from US$50,000 to US$2,000 per capita) using the generic LT response of yield to nitrogen availability (equation (2)), a \u2018farm gate to food plate\u2019 price ratio of 1 and a decrease in the marginal cost of nitrogen pollution with GDP. For comparison, the optimal nitrogen rate for farming in the European Union is shown.\nSource data\nThe optimal nitrogen rate for society (SONR) is lower than the optimal rate for farming, and the difference between these values increases strongly with GDP. At anYmaxof 6\u2009t\u2009ha\u22121and a GDP of US$50,000 per capita, the optimal values for farm and society are 207 and 88\u2009kgN\u2009ha\u22121, respectively, and for a GDP of US$2,000 capita the corresponding values are 209 and 197\u2009kgN\u2009ha\u22121, respectively. However,Ymaxalso tends to increase with GDP because of better access to technology and high-yielding cultivars and better farm management. The lower the GDP, the lower the difference between the optimal nitrogen rates for farming and society. The higher the potential yield, the smaller the difference between the optimal nitrogen rates for countries.\nFor regional farm nutrient management and national environmental management, knowledge of the safe operating space for nitrogen application is more relevant than knowledge of the optimum point values. The concept of \u2018safe space\u2019 of nitrogen application47can be defined as the nitrogen range where yields are high, pollution is low and where net economic benefits for both farming and society are in balance48. This \u2018safe space\u2019 of nitrogen rates is illustrated for three GDP levels, US$50,000 per capita (typical for North America and the northwestern European Union), US$25,000 per capita (typical for the central and southern European Union), US$10,000 per capita (typical for Eastern Europe and South America) and for two \u2018food plate to farm gate\u2019 cereal price ratios.\nThe minimumYmaxallowing \u2018safe\u2019 (beneficial) application of nitrogen fertilizer decreases with increasing GDP (Fig.7). The safe range of nitrogen rates, with robust net benefits for both farming and society, is fairly constant, increasing only slightly with GDP. However, the optimum range with high benefits for both farming and society strongly decreases with increasing GDP and price ratio. With increasing GDP, society is increasingly willing to pay to prevent the impacts of nitrogen pollution and the fixed farm costs per hectare increase (for both, we use a GDP elasticity of 0.85).\nNitrogen application as calcium ammonium nitrate equivalents at a fertilizer price of US$1\u2009kgN\u22121and assuming no other nitrogen inputs than background (SN) of 25\u2009kgN\u2009ha\u22121. Grain price is US$0.2\u2009kg\u22121. Damage cost per kilogram of nitrogen surplus increases with GDP (by US$4, US$10 and US$20\u2009kg\u22121for GDPs of US$10,000 (right panels), US$25,000 (middle panels) and US$50,000 (left panels) per capita, respectively), as does fixed farm cost (US$185, US$480 and US$980\u2009ha\u22121, respectively). The \u2018robust\u2019 range of nitrogen rates is set at 0.25 of the range with net benefits.\nWhen food prices are high\u2014for example, in the event of food shortage or food hedonism\u2014people tend to accept more nitrogen pollution. Our welfare analysis is simple and we did not consider feedback effects of regional changes in cereal production on prices of grain and land. If SONR were to be applied globally, global yield supply would not change very much as lower nitrogen rates and yields in developed regions would be compensated by increases in developing regions. Furthermore, the farm gate price of raw cereals contributes about 10% to the price of cereal food products in the United States and the European Union (Supplementary Note13). Therefore the LT effects of a modest change in global cereal supply on cereal prices will be modest, in spite of the relative inelasticity of cereal demand49.\nEONR is more sensitive to the shape of the LT nitrogen response curve than to the price of cereal. SONR is most sensitive toYmaxfor highYmax(8\u2009t\u2009ha\u22121) and high GDP (US$50,000 per capita), while for mediumYmax(4\u2009t\u2009ha\u22121) and medium GDP (US$10,000 per capita) it is also sensitive to GDP. Uncertainty in EONR is also dominated by uncertainty in the shape of the LT nitrogen response curve, while uncertainty inYmaxcontributes most to uncertainty in SONR (Supplementary Note12). Uncertainties in SONR (6\u20138%) are higher than for yield (1\u20132%) and do not affect our welfare analysis, which is intended to illustrate the direction and approximate size of effects ofYmaxandNrateon SONR, focusing on high- and middle-income countries. For low-income countries (GDP\u2009<\u2009US$1,000 per capita) SONR converges to EONR (Figs.6and7), but our welfare analysis is less applicable here due to the lack of valuation data for nitrogen pollution.\nFor the Netherlands, which has a GDP close to US$50,000 per capita, currentYmaxranges between 8 and 10\u2009t\u2009ha\u22121, while current (mineral) fertilizer equivalent nitrogen rates range between 150 and 200\u2009kgN\u2009ha\u22121(Supplementary Note12). This current range overlaps with the safe space, but current nitrogen rates exceed the optimal nitrogen rates for society by 15\u201330\u2009kgN\u2009ha\u22121. The same conclusion applies to France (GDP\u2009=\u2009US$35,000 per capita), while for Romania with a GDP of US$9,000 per capita, current nitrogen rates of between 50 and 100\u2009kgN\u2009ha\u22121are about 50\u2009kgN\u2009ha\u22121below the safe space (Supplementary Note12). Transposing 30\u2009kgN on a hectare under wheat from the Netherlands to Romania would increase the societal benefit, without yield loss. For countries with a GDP\u2009<\u2009US$5,000 per capita, optimal nitrogen rates for farming and society converge. For China (GDP\u2009=\u2009US$3,200 per capita; rainfed wheatYmax=\u20096\u20139\u2009t\u2009ha\u22121), current nitrogen rates of 200\u2013300\u2009kgN\u2009ha\u22121exceed the farming optimum of 200\u2013225\u2009kgN\u2009ha\u22121. In India (GDP\u2009=\u2009US$1,000 per capita,Ymax=\u20093\u20136\u2009t\u2009ha\u22121) current nitrogen rates are around 100\u2009kgN\u2009ha\u22121which is about half of EONR and SONR, while urea fertilizer is subsidized. In Kenya (GDP\u2009=\u2009US$1,200 per capita,Ymax=\u20093\u20136\u2009t\u2009ha\u22121) current rates are around 50\u2009kgN\u2009ha\u22121, and about 30% of EONR and SONR.\nGaps between current nitrogen rates and the safe operating space may appear quite modest but will tend to increase in the future for different reasons. In the European Union this gap will increase due to stricter environmental nitrogen policies and ambitions for extensification and nature inclusiveness, which both will tend to reduce yields per hectare. In Kenya and India, as examples of developing regions, increasing GDP will increase willingness to pay to reduce pollution and therefore increase marginal external nitrogen costs per kilogram of nitrogen surplus. The shape of the safe range ofYmax\u2013Nratecombinations illustrates that for nitrogen rates above 150\u2009kgN\u2009ha\u22121development and access to higher-yielding cultivars is a better strategy for more sustainable agriculture than strategies to increase application of synthetic nitrogen.\nBased on 25 LT field experiments with maize, wheat or barley we found a generic relationship expressing the responses of both cereal yield and agronomic nitrogen efficiency to nitrogen application rate. The relationship is applicable globally and for a wide range of conditions. It is very different from the short-term responses that are commonly used. The generic relationship applies forYmaxin the range 2\u201316\u2009t\u2009ha\u22121as in the underlying observations. AYmaxlower than 2\u2009t\u2009ha\u22121indicates strong growth limitation by water or other factors, hampering normal crop development and response to nitrogen fertilizer, while aYmaxabove 16\u2009t\u2009ha\u22121may apply to special cultivars or management practices. The LT trials used in this study do not include use of manure, but our generic curve is probably also applicable for organic fertilizers using replacement values for manure nitrogen by assuming an observed LT fertilizer replacement value of 1 (ref.50). While initial results for lowland rice are promising, more LTEs for other regions are needed for global applicability. Global application can be improved by compilation and analysis of observations of SN andY0. The mere existence of these curves may point to universal principles of plant metabolism and scalable mass relationships as found by West et al.51. Application of our generic response curve has important implications for optimal nitrogen rates for agriculture and society as needed to ensure farm income, food sufficiency and sustainable agrofood systems. As an illustration for agriculture, we recalculated the global maize production reported by Mueller et al.52using our generic response curve. This reduced the global maize yield by about 120 Mt (20%) for the same global amount of nitrogen fertilizer use. This implies that the LT nitrogen fertilizer needed to achieve a target maize yield (here, for 2000) is higher by 6 MtN (40%) than that based on the ST response. This indicates that current global maize production relies on unsustainable net soil nitrogen depletion (Supplementary Note12). As an illustration for society, we find that the inclusion of external costs of nitrogen fertilizer use in intensive, high-income countries reduces optimum nitrogen rates for cereals by almost 25% compared with current optimum rates for farm economy. Using our generic response function, the nitrogen rate that safeguards robust farm returns, regional food sufficiency and more acceptable nitrogen pollution levels varies greatly across the world. \u2018Too little\u2019 regions need more nitrogen fertilizer to jump-start crop yields and replenish nitrogen-depleted soils, whereas \u2018too much\u2019 regions with high GDP need to reduce nitrogen fertilizer input3,48. Policies to implement SONR globally will both reduce and redistribute global use of synthetic nitrogen and may have important consequences for the current food system, for example, changes of land use (and land prices and rent), choice of cultivars and rotations to increase NUE, and possibly higher food prices and farm gate prices to compensate for lower yields per hectare. The route towards SONR needs to be evaluated against other options to reconcile nitrogen pollution and food sufficiency, both regarding farm nitrogen management (not only the nitrogen rate but also precision nitrogen timing and placement and use of fertilizer products with higher nitrogen efficiency) and nitrogen policies (for example, nitrogen regulation versus nitrogen taxation). Our long-term nonlinear response of yields to changed input of synthetic fertilizer could be incorporated in computable general equilibrium models to improve projection on how markets respond to changes in fertilizer regimes or policies. Our calculation of the external cost of nitrogen pollution could be used to define nitrogen pollution taxes as part of policies to offset the regressive distributional effects of internalizing external effects. Implementation of more inclusive nitrogen policies that account for environmental costs comes with the risk of increased land demand and will change the spatial allocation of cereal production and regional import\/export of cereals (for example, in Europe53). These risks can be mitigated by additional policies to reduce food waste and change food choices54to prevent export of nitrogen polluting agricultural activities from high- to low-GDP countries44. Dealing with nitrogen problems in global agriculture requires a holistic nitrogen55and food system approach, balancing risks and opportunities for changes in land use and resource security for agriculture, rural livelihoods and dietary choice56.\nWe used results from the Broadbalk LTE at Rothamsted Research to construct LT nitrogen response curves for winter wheat in rotation and continuous wheat20. Results apply to trials at the Broadbalk site for the period 1985\u20132018, where only mineral fertilizer was used and phosphorus, potassium, magnesium and pesticides were adequately supplied. Mineral nitrogen application levels were 0, 48, 96, 144, 192, 240 and 288\u2009kgN\u2009ha\u22121. Phosphorus fertilizer rates were 0 and 35\u2009kgP\u2009ha\u22121, and the potassium rate was fixed at 90\u2009kgK\u2009ha\u22121. At low nitrogen levels, grain yields for 35\u2009kgP\u2009ha\u22121were somewhat higher but not significantly so (95% confidence interval; Supplementary Fig.2). Therefore, the results for 0 and 35\u2009kgP\u2009ha\u22121were pooled for the analysis of nitrogen response. The zero-fertilizer plots further offer insight into effects of changing air pollution and climate on crop yield over the past 150 years. Interestingly, the yields of winter wheat in the zero-fertilizer plots have varied considerably over the past 150 years, between 0.5 and 1.5\u2009t\u2009ha\u22121but showed no net increase or decrease. However, yields of optimally fertilized plots in crop rotation showed a yield increase by a factor of 5 for winter wheat.\nThe wheat varieties used were Brimstone (1985\u20131990), Apollo (1991\u20131995), Hereward (1996\u20132012) and Crusoe (2013\u20132018); data for 2015 were excluded from the analysis as spring wheat was sown that year, due to very wet autumn weather conditions preventing the usual sowing of winter wheat. For wheat in rotation preceding crops were mostly potato or forage maize.\nData for the ST nitrogen response of winter wheat in rotation are based on 15 trials for commercial crops in different parts of England representative of the main arable areas in 1994\u2013199825. Mineral nitrogen application levels were 0, 80, 120, 160, 2000, 240 and 280\u2009kgN\u2009ha\u22121, that is, in the same range as in the Broadbalk experiment (and without explicit information on the rotation).\nThe ST\u2013LT distinction is to some extent arbitrary. The most relevant consideration is that soil nitrogen should be sufficiently close to steady state that the yield response to a change in fertilizer input can be quantified, which could also be formulated as that response curves have adequate curvature to determine SN andYmax. For Europe we used 11 LTEs for winter wheat and two for barley57. We used eight LTEs for wheat in South Asia and found two for China. For maize we found three LTEs for the United States (Supplementary Note4) and two for China. This added up to a total of 27 LTEs (Supplementary Note1). These 27 LTEs cover a wide range of soils, climates, cultivars, fertilizer types and management regimes. In all trials, other nutrients were not deficient. Two of the 27 trials were discarded, a wheat trial in Bologna, Italy with SN\u2009=\u2009103\u2009kgN\u2009ha\u22121and one in Punjab, Pakistan with SN\u2009=\u2009389\u2009kgN\u2009ha\u22121). We considered SN values exceeding 100\u2009kgN\u2009ha\u22121as an indication that soil nitrogen was too far from steady state.\nSoil types were mostly loam and clay soils. Climates were temperate (mean annual temperature, 9\u2009\u00b0C; annual precipitation, 700\u2009mm), continental (mean monthly minimum temperature, \u221210\u2009\u00b0C; maximum temperature, 30\u2009\u00b0C; annual precipitation, 450\u2013800\u2009mm) and tropical (mean monthly maximum temperature, 35\u201345\u2009\u00b0C; minimum temperature, 7\u201314\u2009\u00b0C; annual precipitation, 1,500\u20131,800 mm). Fertilizer types in Europe and the United States were mostly ammonium nitrate and in Asia mostly urea with sometimes part of the nitrogen fertilization from diammonium phosphate. Fertilizers were applied as one to three dressings, but the number of dressings probably had little effect on nitrogen response58.\nExperimental nitrogen response data were scaled and fitted by second-order polynomials, assuming scaled observations for multiple sites were uncorrelated. For scaling, two transformations were applied,\nyaxis: transformation of observed absolute site yield to yield index by dividing byYmax. Theyindex ranges from 0 to 1.\nxaxis: transformation of the rate of added nitrogen in mineral fertilizer to total nitrogen input rate, including nitrogen inputs from nitrogen deposition, biological nitrogen fixation and net soil nitrogen mineralization. The sum of nitrogen inputs from these other nitrogen sources was approximated by thexintercept of the second-order polynomial fit (Supplementary Fig.I3).\nThe assumption that the 119 scaled observations for the 25 LTEs are uncorrelated while in fact being stratified was tested by comparing the fitted second-order polynomial on the total dataset (equation (2)) to the 25 fitted polynomials for the individual sites. Equation (2) proved to be identical to the median regression line after sorting the 25 regressions byYrforNav=\u2009100\u2009kgN\u2009ha\u22121.\nWhile nitrogen fertilizer input is generally the main driver for increasing cereal yields, overfertilization and poor timing and placement of fertilizer is a major cause of nitrogen pollution48,59. Data on nitrogen content in grain and straw were only available for the Broadbalk LTE and not for the 25 global LTEs. The NUE in the Broadbalk LTE is expected to be higher than for most global practices in view of better management and assumed near steady state. The nitrogen content in grain for wheat in rotation in the Broadbalk LTE is about 1.5% up to a total nitrogen input of 100\u2009kgN\u2009ha\u22121, increasing linearly up to 300\u2009kgN\u2009ha\u22121(Supplementary Note9). A linear model ofN% withYmaxandNavwas fitted to observations between 1985 and 2016, in whichYmaxfor a given year varied between 6.5 and 12.9\u2009t\u2009ha\u22121.\nwhereN% is the nitrogen percentage in grain. The nitrogen dilution effect with increasingYmaxand the nitrogen enrichment withNavare both highly significant (>99.9%) and relevant, but the statistical significance of the effect ofNav(t-statistic, 24.5) is larger than that ofYmax(t-statistic, \u22125.6). In view of the LT nature of the Broadbalk LTEs and the application of nitrogen rate scaling, equation (4) has global applicability for wheat cultivation.\nWhile grain yields level off with nitrogen input, the LT nitrogen removal in grain increases from a zero intercept almost proportionally with nitrogen input up to 250\u2009kgN\u2009ha\u22121, which is in line with previous findings for arable systems on a country scale59(Supplementary Fig.22b). Nitrogen surpluses and the subsequent risk of nitrate leaching start at a total nitrogen availability of 180\u2009kgN\u2009ha\u22121, which for Broadbalk corresponds to a nitrogen fertilizer rate of 150\u2009kgN\u2009ha\u22121(Supplementary Fig.22c). The mean NUE for the 32 years of observation increases from 40% at 50\u2009kgN\u2009ha\u22121to a peak at about 80% at a total nitrogen availability of 150\u2009kgN\u2009ha\u22121and gradually decreases again to 60%. AnNavof 150\u2009kgN\u2009ha\u22121in the Broadbalk LTE corresponds to a nitrogen fertilizer rate of 120\u2009kgN\u2009ha\u22121(Supplementary Fig.22d). The observed initial increase in NUE may be caused by increased tillering and root development with addition of nitrogen fertilizer, promoting efficient uptake of available nitrogen and internal nitrogen allocation (sink strength governed by tiller and grain numbers).\nIn this paper we combine approaches from microeconomics (production economics, individual optimizing agents), environmental economics (price on externalities) and macroeconomics (regional to global agriculture, society, welfare). Our basic macroeconomic analysis considers differences in prices and costs around the world, but does not account for multiple interacting markets and their effects on cereal prices when cereal supply changes. We calculate two economic optima for nitrogen application: for cereal farming and for society. In both cases, the optima depend on the slope of the nitrogen response curves (Supplementary Figs.23and24). The net benefit functionBis:\nwherePyis the crop price (US$\u2009kg\u22121), PN is the fertilizer price (US$\u2009kgN\u22121),Cfixedis the cost of seed, tillage, harvest and other inputs, and CNpollutthe external cost of nitrogen pollution. For farming, CNpollutis not considered. By considering prices for both farming and welfare, equation (5) combines production economics and environmental economics because it addresses both producers and consumers. How both agents will respond to these prices to maximize their utility will depend on policy context. The negative externalities can be implemented as a tax on nitrogen and in that case the two optimal nitrogen applications would be the same. Alternative communication of nitrogen issues and design of nitrogen policies can make farmers beneficiaries of reduced nitrogen pollution and consumers virtual payers of improved nitrogen fertilizer management (for example, by food labelling and nitrogen footprinting,http:\/\/www.n-print.org\/).\nThe economic optimum for farming can be determined from the following equation:\nwhere dY\/dNavis the first derivative of the unscaled nitrogen response function as derived from equations (1) or (2), using case-specific values ofYmaxand SN. For the calculation of the optimum nitrogen rates the quadratic global relation between cereal yield andNav(equation (2)) is substituted in equation (6). The minimum value ofNavis calculated by solving equation (5) forB=\u20090. This minimum nitrogen rate depends strongly onCfixed;Cfixedincreases per unit of yield with decreasing yield and provides the penalty for farmers when decreasing nitrogen input too much. The resulting equation forBcan also be expressed as a second-order polynomial of nitrogen rate, and optima and cross-points simply follow from standard calculus for solution of quadratic functions.\nThe calculation of the optimum nitrogen rate for society also accounts for the increase in nitrogen pollution with increasing nitrogen input:\nPyis not the farm gate price of cereals as such, but the price equivalent as paid by those who are bearing the cost of nitrogen pollution. This virtual \u2018food plate\u2019 price of rough grain could be higher than the farm gate price and accounts for value creation in food processing after correction for assignable costs (for example, labour and energy for milling and baking) and reflects the cost of shareholder dividends, risk insurances or market imperfections in the cereal supply chain. Because this price is uncertain, we solved equation (7) forPyequal to the farm gate price and three times this value. A ratio of 3 is consistent with the relative increase of gross added value of all agricultural commodities in food processing in the European Union (ratio of 2) and the United States (ratio of 3). A ratio of 3 is also consistent with a ratio of 1.2\u20132.6 based on the farm gate price of bread wheat in northwest Europe (US$0.25\u2009kg\u22121) and in bread (US$0.3\u20130.6\u2009kg\u22121) (Supplementary Note13). To include the cost of the various impacts of nitrogen pollution,\\(N_{{\\mathrm{pollut}}_i}\\)(where subscriptirefers to various nitrogen pollutants, for example, NO3, NH3, N2O) can be expressed in monetary units by multiplying the pollutant flux by their respective unit damage costs (US$\u2009kgN\u22121)11. Pollutant fluxes are estimated as fractions of nitrogen inputs or nitrogen fluxes. Here we approximatedNpollutby nitrogen surplus and a lumped unit damage cost per kilogram of nitrogen surplus (Supporting Note10). Nitrogen surplus was calculated as:\nwhereNremovalis the nitrogen removed by the crop, calculated as:Y\u00d7N%\/100 (whereN% is calculated from equation (4)). The resulting relations betweenBandNavcan be expressed as third-order polynomials and optima and cross-points were determined using the SOLVER function in Excel.\nTo calculate the optimal values and safe ranges ofYmaxandNavwe used a ceteris paribus approach, and did not take into account consequential effects of changes in cereal production onPyorCfixed, the latter caused, for example, by effects of land prices and rent. This would require application of computable general equilibrium models to model global supply, demand and trade of cereals, and would involve many assumptions, for example, regarding changes in relative use of cereals for food, feed and fuel. Our simple economic approach is to demonstrate the effect of using LT instead of ST response curves and considering the social cost of nitrogen surplus and the safe operating range ofNav.\nThe current nitrogen rate for wheat on sandy to loamy soil in the Netherlands is 165\u2009kgN\u2009ha\u22121and 60% of nitrogen is applied as manure60. For the calculation of total allowable nitrogen rate, it is assumed that 1\u2009kg of manure nitrogen has a fertilizer equivalence of 60% of 1\u2009kgN applied as calcium ammonium nitrate, and manure nitrogen input for arable systems is limited to 170\u2009kgN\u2009ha\u22121(ref.60). Current Dutch environmental legislation limits the total fertilizer equivalent nitrogen rate from synthetic fertilizer and manure for winter wheat to 165\u2009kgN\u2009ha\u22121for sandy soils and to 190\u2009kgN\u2009ha\u22121for loess. These rates are economically suboptimal for farming, irrespective of the use of ST or LT curves. However, winter wheat is grown in rotation which provides residual soil nitrogen for the subsequent wheat crop. For the fixed cost of (contracted) labour for planting, tillage, crop management and harvest for wheat cultivation in the Netherlands we used a value of US$680\u2009ha\u22121yr\u22121, and for other inputs such as phosphorus, potassium, pesticides and energy we used a value of US$430\u2009ha\u22121yr\u22121(Supplementary Note10).\nFor quantification of the cost of nitrogen pollution for other countries we used a GDP-dependent cost per unit of nitrogen surplus (UC), derived from results for 27 EU countries3,44(Supplementary Note11):\nIn the EU27 dataset the mean national GDP between 2010 and 2014 ranged from US$7,000 per capita in Bulgaria to US$59,000 per capita in Denmark (excluding the US$108,000 per capita for the very small country of Luxembourg), the nitrogen surplus in 2008 between 23\u2009kgN\u2009ha\u22121of used agricultural land in Romania and 176\u2009kgN\u2009ha\u22121in the Netherlands, and the UC ranged from US$2\u2009kgN\u22121(Bulgaria) to US$43\u2009kgN\u22121(Denmark). The GDP effect reflects increasing willingness to pay to prevent nitrogen pollution, making GDP a major determinant for external costs of nitrogen pollution of waters in Europe13, but less so for the United States and the rest of the world61.\nIn the Netherlands and many other areas with intensive use of manure or urea fertilizer, ammonia losses are mainly associated with manure, and the impacts of ammonia-containing aerosols on human health dominate nitrogen pollution cost3,44. Globally, ammonia losses depend on the choice between ammonia (often urea) or nitrate-type fertilizer (often calcium ammonium nitrate), the use of manure and the application of low-emission techniques. All these factors will change considerably in the near future due to improved management to increase cost-efficiency and as a consequence of environmental regulation.\nFurther information on research design is available in theNature Research Reporting Summarylinked to this article.\nSummaries of nitrogen response data for the Broadbalk winter wheat experiments at Rothamsted Research and for global cereals are provided in theSupplementary Information; details are available upon reasonable request.

Using a resource-allocation model, we compared the effects of circularity on the supply of animal-source nutrients in Europe with the nutritional requirements of the EAT-Lancet reference diet. We found the two to be compatible in terms of total animal-source proteins but not specific animal-source foods; in particular, the EAT-Lancet guidelines recommend larger quantities of poultry meat over beef and pork, while a circular food system produces mainly milk, dairy-beef and pork. Compared with the EAT-Lancet reference diet, greenhouse gas emissions were reduced by up to 31% and arable land use reduced by up to 42%. Careful consideration of the feasible substitutability between animal-source foods is needed to define potential roles of animal products in circular human diets.\nThe global food system is responsible for about a quarter of all human-induced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, one-third of global terrestrial acidification and the majority of global eutrophication, and is occupying 40% of the world\u2019s ice- and desert-free land1,2. The global trend of a growing affluent population, thereby shifting diets towards resource-intensive foods (for example, meat), is raising concerns that the Earth\u2019s biophysical limits will be exceeded3. To halt this progression, numerous healthy and environmentally friendly dietary guidelines have been proposed4,5,6,7. Such dietary guidelines aim to improve health outcomes by reducing the risk of non-communicable diseases (for example, cardiovascular disease, colorectal cancer and type 2 diabetes), while simultaneously reducing environmental impacts (for example, GHG emissions, deforestation, eutrophication and biodiversity loss)3,5,8. One prominent example of healthy and environmentally sustainable dietary guidelines is the one proposed by the EAT-Lancet Commission. Compared with conventional diets consumed in the European Union and the United Kingdom (EU-27 + UK) the EAT-Lancet dietary guidelines contain increased quantities of plant-source food, such as vegetables, legumes and nuts, and decreased quantities of animal-source food, such as meat, milk, eggs and fish4.\nThe foods that European societies consume, and the way in which these foods are produced, contribute substantially to destabilizing several planetary boundaries9,10. Although there is a general consensus that the consumption of animal-source food in the EU-27 + UK should decrease, there is no consensus about the degree of reduction of animal-source food to achieve environmentally sustainable diets11. Some studies suggest that it would be best for the planet if we were to consume only plant-source foods (for example, ref.12), while others show that farm animals reared under a circular paradigm can play a crucial role in feeding humanity13,14,15,16,17. Circular food systems aim to optimally utilize resources by prioritizing arable land to produce plant biomass for human consumption, thus avoiding feed\u2013food competition18,19. Currently about 40% of our global arable land area is used to produce high-quality feed for farm animals, which to a large extent is human-edible20. From a resource-efficiency point of view farm animals could instead be fed what is currently considered low-opportunity-cost biomass (LCB). LCB includes co-products from the food industry (for example, wheat middlings or slaughter waste from farm animals which is currently prohibited), food waste and grassland resources15. In the current food system, humans cannot or do not want to consume these resources; instead, LCB can be fed to farm animals to increase their resource-use efficiency and potentially reduce the environmental impact of animal-source food17,21.\nOur aim was to assess whether adhering to the circularity principle of feeding LCB to farm animals within the EU-27 + UK is compatible with the recommended animal-source food consumption in healthy and environmentally friendly dietary guidelines. We took a reference diet derived from the EAT-Lancet guidelines as an example of a future healthy diet that was the product of a food system with environmental impacts that remained within planetary boundaries4. To adhere to circularity principles applied to the EU-27 + UK, animals were fed co-products and food waste resulting from the plant-source fraction of the EAT-Lancet dietary guidelines (Fig.1). In addition, grassland resources and slaughter by-products from farm animals could be used as animal feed. A resource-allocation model was used to distribute the LCB among animal production systems (dairy, beef, pigs, broilers, laying hens, Atlantic salmon and Nile tilapia) to maximize protein production while respecting recommended animal-source food intake levels of the EAT-Lancet dietary guidelines and to calculate land use and GHG emissions. We did not consider the economic consequences of feeding LCB to livestock. Crop and animal production systems in the EU-27 + UK were based on current management and yields (that is, kg per hectare or kg per animal). The nutrient adequacy of any changes to the EAT-Lancet dietary guidelines was assessed against the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) human nutrient intake requirements22. Four explorative theoretical scenarios were investigated (Table1), which assess the impacts of changing diets on land use and GHG emissions (although we remain aware that agricultural practices are driven by a larger array of factors): (1) an EAT-Lancet reference scenario which represented the EAT-Lancet dietary guidelines in their current form (EL Reference); (2) a healthier wholegrain diet with a fixed composition of animal-source food (EL Circular Wholegrain Fixed); (3) a refined grain diet with a fixed composition of animal-source food (EL Circular Refined-grain Fixed); (4) a wholegrain diet with an unrestrained quantity of animal-source food to demonstrate the production potential of animals fed LCB (EL Circular Wholegrain Potential). The EL Circular Wholegrain Fixed and EL Circular Refined-grain Fixed scenarios offer insights into how grain consumption can influence the role of animals when adopting circularity principles. Consuming wholegrains is preferred from a health perspective; however, consuming refined grains results in additional by-products for animal feed derived from cereal processing15,23. This is meant as an example because processing often impacts the potential production of animals fed LCB and health, for example, rice or potatoes with or without peels. The EL Circular Wholegrain Fixed and EL Circular Wholegrain Potential Scenarios provide insight into the debate about which and how many animals to keep in a circular food system and the trade-offs and synergies with health recommendations.\nExample shown represents the EL Circular Wholegrain Fixed scenario. All flows are in grams fresh matter per human capita per day except grass which is in grams dry matter (DM) per human capita per day. Green flows indicate modelled flows. Dashed line indicates flow of slaughter waste back to co-product.\nOur analysis revealed that animals exclusively fed LCB were unable to provide the combination of meat, milk, eggs and fish recommended in the EAT-Lancet dietary guidelines, largely due to an insufficient quantity of high-quality LCB. In total, the reference diet derived from the EAT-Lancet dietary guidelines contained 71\u2009g of meat and fish, 250\u2009g of milk and 13\u2009g of eggs per capita per day. It was, nevertheless, possible to fulfil the \u2018total\u2019 recommendations by adjusting the share of meat and fish while respecting the healthy range. The reference value for pork, for example, is 7\u2009g, while the healthy range is 0\u201314\u2009g pork per capita per day.\nIn the EL Circular Wholegrain Fixed scenario, the recommended quantities of milk and fish could be met while meat was only 1% short; eggs were 100% short of meeting the recommended intake in the EAT-Lancet dietary guidelines. No eggs were produced in the EL Circular Wholegrain Fixed scenario. In the EL Circular Refined-grain Fixed scenario, the recommended quantities of meat, milk, eggs and fish could be met and exceeded (meat and fish, 12%) due to the additional LCB available from the refining of grains (for example, wheat bran). However, adjusting the shares of meat and fish was still required. Compared to the EL Circular Wholegrain Fixed, the EL Circular Refined-grain Fixed scenario could produce more poultry meat (12\u2009g versus 2\u2009g of poultry meat) and meet the recommended intake of eggs in the EAT-Lancet dietary guidelines (13 eggs per capita per day). From a health perspective, the consumption of poultry meat is preferred over the consumption of beef and pork4. Broilers and laying hens, however, were limited in their ability to upcycle all types of LCB and mainly required the co-products from refined grains. This creates a trade-off between consuming healthy wholegrains or producing healthy white poultry meat and eggs.\nThe EL Circular Wholegrain Potential scenario showed the optimal allocation of LCB (in terms of maximizing protein production) to different animals (Fig.2). This scenario resulted in an increase in pork production (to 44\u2009g per capita per day) due to the ability of pigs to convert low-quality co-products and food waste into animal-source food. Milk production also increased (to 523\u2009g per capita per day) as dairy cattle are efficient converters of LCB (especially grassland) to protein. Increased milk production increased the supply of cull cows which produced additional beef. The increase of pork and milk was at the expense of poultry and fish production, thus showing a trade-off between optimally utilizing LCB and producing the preferred white meat.\nOn this graph \u2018100%\u2019 is equal to the recommended daily intake in the EAT-Lancet dietary guidelines, that is, 28\u2009g of fish, 7\u2009g of pork, 13\u2009g of eggs, 29\u2009g of poultry meat, 7\u2009g of beef and 250\u2009g of milk.\nOur results showed that all EL Circular scenarios increased the supply of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)\/docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), zinc, iron, vitamin B12 and protein compared to the EL Reference. The supply of calcium and energy was only increased compared to the EL Reference in the EL Circular Wholegrain Potential scenario.\nCompared to the EFSA dietary nutrient requirements, the EL Circular Wholegrain Fixed, EL Circular Refined-grain Fixed scenarios and the EL Reference did not meet zinc, calcium and vitamin B12 requirements (Fig.3and SupplementaryInformation). Notably, the EL Reference also fails to meet EPA\/DHA average nutrient requirements (Fig.3). The EL Circular Wholegrain Potential did meet the calcium and vitamin B12 requirements but not zinc, however, largely due to an increase in milk production (250\u2009g versus 523\u2009g). For all nutrients except EPA\/DHA (due to less fish), nutrient supply was greatest in the EL Circular Wholegrain Potential scenario. Besides calcium and fat, all three circularity diets outperformed the EAT-Lancet diet on available nutrients.\nOn this graph \u2018100%\u2019 refers to the daily average nutrient requirements outlined by EFSA (see SupplementaryInformation). Nutrients are shown from animal-source food (solid fraction) and plant-source food (shaded fraction). Total daily dietary nutrient supply includes the solid and unshaded fractions.\nOverall, GHG emissions were 31% and 23% lower in the EL Circular Wholegrain Fixed and EL Circular Refined-grain Fixed scenario compared with the EL Reference diet. The reduction in emissions was due to the avoided emissions related to the production of animal feed (for example, nitrous oxide (N2O) from nitrogen fertilization) and the EL Circular Wholegrain Fixed scenario requiring less grain production (that is, more grain was destined for human consumption, due to no refining). Figure4shows GHG emissions and animal-source food protein produced from all three EL Circular scenarios and the EL Reference diet. Higher quantities of animal-source food (and therefore protein) were produced in the EL Circular Wholegrain Potential and lower quantities in the EL Circular Wholegrain Fixed scenarios which influenced GHG emissions (Fig.4). The EL Circular scenarios include a default GHG emission value (according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) tier 2 approach) and a range of uncertainty to reflect the uncertainty in GHG emissions. Optimally utilizing LCB (to maximize protein production from animal-source food) in the EL Circular Wholegrain Potential scenario increased default GHG emissions to 483\u2009kg CO2e per capita per year from 390\u2009kg CO2e per capita per year in the EL Circular Refined-grain Fixed scenario (largely due to an increase in milk and pork production, SupplementaryInformation). The types of animal-source food produced impacted the ratio of GHG emissions; in the EL Circular Wholegrain Potential scenario additional dairy increased the contribution of methane (CH4) to total GHG emissions (Figs.2and4). The default GHG emission values of all scenarios were within the safe operating space of the planetary boundaries\u2019 framework (511\u2009kg CO2e for food production per capita per year4). In all EL Circular scenarios, the upper limit to the range of uncertainty was beyond the safe operating space (Fig.4).\nGHG emissions (kg CO2e capita per year) and protein intake from animal-source food (g per capita per day) of the EL Circular scenarios compared to the GHG emission results calculated by the EAT-Lancet Commission for its reference diet (red dot). Range indicates uncertainty in GHG emissions. Pie charts indicate midpoint (default) GHG emissions and contribution of each GHG (N2O and CH4).\nOverall, cropland use was lower in all EL Circular scenarios than in the EL Reference diet (Fig.5). However, it is important to note that cropland use for the EAT-Lancet reference scenario was based on a global cropland use average and could overestimate EU cropland use per capita; all EL Circular scenarios were based on EU cropland-use data specific for the EU. Further, utilizing cropland to produce animal feed also led to an increase in land use in the EAT-Lancet reference scenario. Cropland use was lowest in the EL Circular Wholegrain Fixed and EL Circular Wholegrain Potential scenarios due to the use of wholegrains requiring less land (that is, lower amounts of co-products from wheat result in less land required), although differences with using refined grain were marginal. Grassland use of the EL Circular Wholegrain Fixed and EL Circular Refined-grain Fixed were similar while the EL Circular Wholegrain Potential scenario resulted in higher grassland use because the use of grassland resources was increased for milk production (Fig.3).\nCropland use (hectares per capita per year) from the EL Reference diet (which is an estimate for the entire globe, calculated by the EAT-Lancet Commission) compared to cropland and grassland use in the EU-27 + UK for the three EL Circular scenarios.\nThe production of milk and beef in circular food systems is highly dependent on the availability of grassland. Variation exists in the data on the quantity and quality of current grassland in the EU-27 + UK depending on the study and definition of grassland (that is, between managed and natural grassland) and available data sources. We compared the animal-source food output (for example, milk) of the EL Circular Wholegrain Potential scenario with different areas of managed grassland resulting from three different studies\/models24,25,26. Milk production and beef (from dairy cattle) ranged, respectively, from 291 to 748 and 11 to 32 g per capita per day (SupplementaryInformation). Including natural grasslands could further increase the output of animal-source food.\nOur results show that the overall quantity of animal-source protein in the EAT-Lancet dietary guidelines can be met, but that the precise levels of inclusion of different animal-source foods in such a diet cannot be achieved by only feeding LCB to animals. The extent to which the recommended quantities of animal-source food could be met largely depended on the availability of LCB. The EL Circular Wholegrain Fixed scenario versus the EL Circular Refined-grain Fixed scenario revealed that the role animals can play in circular food systems will be narrowed as we move towards healthier consumption of plant-source foods. With today\u2019s food consumption patterns, several food groups are consumed in highly processed forms, resulting in additional by-products on the one hand, but increasing the risk for non-communicable diseases on the other hand27. The example employed here, wheat, results in by-products such as wheat bran and wheat germ if wheat is consumed in a refined manner. If it is, however, consumed as wholegrain, as recommended in the EAT-Lancet dietary guidelines, no by-products occur. Potatoes, vegetables and fruits would be other examples; if potatoes, for example, are industrially processed, their peel can be collected and used as animal feed.\nAlthough dietary guidelines could not be met, it was possible to meet the nutrient recommendations when the EAT-Lancet diet restrictions were removed (that is, the EL Circular Wholegrain Potential scenario). Comparing the two EL Circular Fixed scenarios with the EL Circular Wholegrain Potential scenario showed that some animal species were more efficient at upcycling LCB (for example, dairy cattle and pigs) than others (for example, poultry). Grass resources, for example, were utilized most efficiently by dairy cattle because ruminants are well adapted to value this feed. Wet or fibrous food leftovers are used most efficiently by pigs, which are known to have a high feed intake capacity. Milk, furthermore, includes relatively high amounts of calcium, and beef and pork are high-quality sources of bioavailable vitamin B12 and zinc28. In other words, each animal has its own unique capacity to convert LCB into specific nutrients. The nutrients provided by animals are of high bioavailability and some, such as vitamin B12 and the omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA, are predominantly provided by animal-source foods and are almost absent in plant-source foods28.\nThe EL Circular scenarios, and in particular the EL Circular Wholegrain Potential scenario, showed that animals raised in a circular food system can play an essential role in providing nutrients. This is in line with earlier findings of, for example, R\u00f6\u00f6s et al.29, van Hal et al.15and van Zanten et al.14. None of those studies, however, assessed the importance of the dietary recommendations. Our results clearly show that although the EL Circular Wholegrain Potential scenario met all the nutrient recommendations except that of zinc, it exceeded the intake of beef and pork. Evidently, a healthy diet is not only defined by the sum of its nutrients. In fact, since the majority of the EL Reference diet was kept constant and clear bounds were set for the animal-source foods, the endowment for a healthy diet can nevertheless be approximated. However, findings from cohort studies suggest that the occurrence of several non-communicable diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, was associated with a relatively high intake of red meat, that is, beef and pork (for example, ref.30). The higher recommended amounts of poultry as compared with beef in the EL Reference diet was justified by the fact that poultry meat does not show associations with increased mortality, and poultry fat moreover provided a higher content of essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (21% versus 4%)4. The above illustrates that although it is important to optimize essential nutrients from animal-source food, following upper limits of dietary guidelines is essential to avoid dietary-related diseases.\nOur results furthermore showed that when circularity principles were adopted, GHG emissions and land use could be reduced compared with the EAT-Lancet diet because feed\u2013food competition was avoided. In Willett et al.4, broilers perform better than, for example, beef from an environmental perspective due to their favourable feed conversion ratio. However, Willett et al.\u2019s assessment is based on impact intensities (for example, GHG emissions per kg of food product) calculated for the current system; it was not considered whether the feed for broilers would also have been suitable as food for humans, or whether the area on which it was grown would have been suitable to grow food for humans. Our analysis clearly shows that as soon as we move towards a circular food system, and hence restrict the role for animals in converting LCB, broilers can no longer compete with, for example, cattle. This has consequences for any dietary guidelines (local or national) that aim to reduce environmental impacts, beyond the global EAT-Lancet diet. This does not mean that broilers cannot play a role in circular food systems, but it demonstrates that the broilers of today are less suited to convert LCB. This stresses the importance of adapting future breeding goals and feeding strategies towards the ability of animals to utilize LCB. This is essential because our results showed that animals can reduce their environmental impact (and the impact of the entire food system) if they increase their efficiency in converting LCB into healthy food.\nOur study and model focused on feeding LCB, including food waste, to animals as a principle of circularity. Preventing food waste in the first instance or revalorizing food waste as food should always remain the priority; only when this is not possible should food waste be used as animal feed31. In other countries (for example, Japan and South Korea), food waste is successfully fed to monogastric animals after a processing and sterilization step before feeding32. In our case we assumed 35% of food waste available is suitable to be fed to animals32. The nutrient content of food waste is highly dependent on the food consumed and discarded, a weighted average based on the amount of food consumed in the human diet and the proportion wasted. By combining these products into one mix the feed value in terms of energy and protein of higher-quality waste products (for example, grains) is diluted by lower-quality waste products (for example, vegetables). Expanding the model employed to separate streams of food waste may increase the amount of animal-source food produced due to a greater availability of high-quality LCB. Further expanding the optimization model to include plant-source food production within the EAT-Lancet diet could offer further opportunities to reduce GHG emissions and land use. In addition, more circularity principles could be captured, including returning nutrients in manure and crop residues to the soil. Applying alternative objective functions (for example, minimizing GHG emissions while meeting the nutrient requirements of the human diet) could also influence the animal production systems selected.\nFinally, it is important to consider the importance of future technologies for our results33. In our work we followed the assumptions made by Willett et al.4. It was, for example, assumed that fossil energy was replaced by renewable-energy sources, causing no CO2emissions, while crop and grass yields were based on current yields and management (obtained from the Miterra-Europe Model and Carlson et al.34). In the coming decades, crop yields might be expected to continue to increase due to ongoing technological developments35,36. Increased crop yields would not, however, alter the main findings of our study because this study focused on the utilization choice of LCB, of which the amount is independent from crop yields. A change in crop yield would affect the environmental impacts of the remaining plant-source food needed to fulfil nutritional requirements. Increased crop yields may lead to lower land-use requirements per capita in each of the scenarios. The impacts of increased crop yields on GHG emissions are less clear. Achieving higher yields is likely to require more nutrient inputs (especially nitrogen37), with associated increases in GHG emissions per tonne of product, but technological developments may also increase nutrient-use efficiencies and thereby play a compensatory role.\nWe demonstrated that feeding LCB to animals has the potential to reduce GHG emissions and land use. Our results showed that the quantity of animal-source protein in EAT-Lancet dietary guidelines could be met, but that the precise animal-source food composition of the EAT-Lancet dietary guidelines could not be met by only feeding LCB to animals. Dietary guidelines recommend poultry meat over beef and pork, whereas in a circular food system mainly milk, dairy-beef and pork are produced. Careful consideration of the feasible substitutability between animal-source foods is urgently needed to define the role of animal products in the human diet. In this way the circularity principle of only feeding animals with LCB can be integrated into healthy and environmentally sustainable diets to further reduce environmental impacts.\nIn this study we extended the resource-allocation model developed by van Hal et al.15to include GHG emissions and land use. This model allocates co-products, food-waste resources (from the EAT-Lancet example diet derived from the EAT-Lancet dietary guidelines4) and grassland resources. We compared environmental impacts of the EL Reference diet with three EL Circular scenarios. Each scenario varied based on the type of grain (wholegrain or refined grain) and the animal-source food composition (Table1).\nWe took a reference diet developed by the EAT-Lancet Commission (derived from the EAT-Lancet dietary guidelines) as a starting point for this study. To better reflect the EU diet, some adjustments were made to grain consumption (that is, more wheat and less rice; the total quantity of grain remained unchanged) based on FAOSTAT4,38.\nTo calculate the amount (that is, tonnes) and area of crop required, and co-products available, reverse calculations were made using food consumption. Quantities of co-products (for example, wheat bran) from crops (for example, wheat) were calculated using FAO technical conversion factors39,40. In some scenarios grains were refined to increase the availability of co-products as animal feed and to better reflect current dietary habits (for example, wheat bran; Table1). Quantities of food waste were calculated using food waste fractions developed by Gustavsson et al.41. This process was performed for each of the EU-27 + UK countries.\nThe model of van Hal et al.15is a resource-allocation model of the EU-27 + UK developed in General Algebraic Modelling System v.30.3. The objective of the model is to maximize animal protein output from a given availability of animal feeds while meeting the nutritional requirements of the animals.\nAnimal systems include livestock (dairy cattle, beef cattle, pigs, broiler chickens and laying hens) and farmed fish (Atlantic salmon and Nile tilapia). The two fish systems are a proxy for a range of species with similar characteristics (for example, rainbow trout for Atlantic salmon). Livestock systems include three productivity levels (high, medium and low) while farmed fish only include a high productivity level. The model included the parent stocks (for example, sows in the pig system) and reproduction stocks (for example, heifers in the dairy system) to account for the entire life cycle of the animal. The nutritional requirements of livestock and farmed fish can be found in the SupplementaryInformation.\nLivestock and farmed fish were exclusively fed co-products, food waste, grassland resources and animal by-products, referred to as LCB. In our model, co-products and animal by-products could be traded between EU-27 + UK countries, while food waste and grassland must be used in the country in which it is produced. The availability of co-products and food waste was set by the EAT-Lancet reference.\nThirty-five percent of the available food waste could be fed to animals as a wet feed, which is considered achievable if the feeding of food waste to animals were to be legalized32. Food waste could only be consumed by monogastric animals and fish due to food safety risks32. The availability of European grassland was based on the Miterra-Europe model26, and it was assumed grassland could only be consumed by ruminants. Our analysis only included managed grassland due to the uncertainty in quantity and quality of natural grasslands in Europe.\nThe availability of animal by-products was a fraction of the predicted live weight output of each livestock system (reported in ref.42). Cannibalism was prevented in livestock systems; in farmed fish systems cannibalism was allowed due to the species being a proxy of a range of species. This enabled intraspecies recycling of by-products from farmed fish, meaning farmed fish can consume by-products of the same species. The nutritional value of LCB for livestock was obtained from the Dutch animal feed board, known as the CVB system43; the nutritional value of LCB for farmed fish was obtained from the International Aquaculture Feed Formulation Database44.\nIn addition to aquaculture, the model includes capture fisheries. Capture fisheries produce fish for human consumption and fish by-products (for example, fish meal) which can be fed in the animal systems. Quantities of capture fisheries (that is, harvested fish in tonnes of fresh fish) were limited to the maximum sustainable yield.\nTo ensure that changes in the quantity and composition of animal-source food in the EAT-Lancet diet did not reduce the supply of nutrients to humans, the nutrient supply of each scenario was assessed against dietary nutrient recommendations from EFSA22. The nutrient content of each food item was based on the US Department of Agriculture food and nutrient database45.\nThe resource-allocation model developed by van Hal et al.15was extended to include GHG emissions calculations. GHG emissions were based on the IPCC and Dutch GHG inventory methodologies46. It was assumed that fossil energy was replaced by renewable energy sources by 2050, causing no CO2emissions, to keep our assumptions in line with the EAT-Lancet study4. The only contribution to land use from livestock was the grassland used as feed for ruminants. Other livestock systems were considered landless or had a very small, negligible land use because livestock are fed exclusively LCB.\nGHG emission calculations were performed using a food systems approach. A food systems approach assesses emissions from the total diet as opposed to emissions per individual products in a life-cycle assessment. Emissions were limited to those occurring on the farm, including manure management, enteric fermentation and grassland production. No other animal feed emissions were considered due to the food-based allocation method47.\nGHG emissions from terrestrial animals (dairy cattle, beef cattle, pigs, broiler chickens and laying hens) included CH4and N2O from manure management. Methane emissions from manure management were calculated by multiplying volatile solid excretion by the methane conversion factor (that is, the conversion factor for each manure management system),B0(that is, the maximum methane-producing capacity for manure) and 0.67 (that is, the conversion of methane from m3to kg CH4)48. Volatile solid excretion was calculated using digestibility of protein and organic matter of feed consumed by the animal species49. N2O emissions from manure management included direct and indirect emissions (the latter resulting from the volatilization of ammonia and nitrogen (di)oxide) from nitrogen excretion in housing systems48. Nitrogen excretion was calculated by subtracting nitrogen retained in meat\/milk\/eggs from nitrogen intake.\nIn addition, ruminant systems included CH4from enteric fermentation and N2O from grassland fertilization. CH4emissions from enteric fermentation were calculated by multiplying gross energy intake byYm(that is, percentage of gross energy in feed converted to CH4) and dividing by 55.65 (that is, the gross energy content of methane)48. N2O emissions from grassland included direct and indirect emissions (the latter resulting from the volatilization of ammonia and nitrogen (di)oxide and the leaching of nitrate) from nitrogen fertilization and manure excretion while grazing50. Grassland fertilization rates were estimated by the Miterra-Europe model based on the assumption that all organic fertilizer produced by grazing animals is applied to fodder crops (for example, grassland and fodder maize) in the same region and based on FAOSTAT data on nitrogen mineral fertilizer26.\nGHG emissions from farmed fish included N2O emissions from the aquaculture system. Nitrogen in unconsumed feed and excreta (nitrogen intake minus nitrogen retained in body tissue) was multiplied by 1.8% and converted from nitrogen to N2O (ref.51).\nGHG emissions were summed into carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e; 100 yr time horizon, 28 for biogenic CH4and 265 for N2O (ref.52)), and summed with plant-source food emissions (see next section) to calculate total GHG emissions. Results were given in GHG emissions per diet per capita per year.\nFor plant-source food, average national crop yields and nitrogen inputs per hectare were estimated using the Miterra-Europe model26with 2017 as a reference year. For national crop yields and nitrogen inputs, direct and indirect N2O emissions were calculated using an IPCC tier 2 approach50. A food-based allocation method was applied where all GHG emissions were allocated to the main food product (for example, wheat flour)47. To calculate GHG emission intensities and crop yields at an EU level, a weighted average was applied based on harvested area in each country. Not all plant-source food was included in the Miterra-Europe model (lentils, groundnuts, tree nuts and bananas). The GHG emission intensities and crop yields per hectare were then estimated using global data, with a reference year of circa 200034. Processing of crop into edible food products and food waste along the supply chain (LCB from the EAT-Lancet diet) were then considered to calculate GHG emission intensities and land use per kg of plant-source food consumed.\nFurther information on research design is available in theNature Research Reporting Summarylinked to this article.\nData are available fromhttps:\/\/doi.org\/10.4121\/16918732\nModel code is available fromhttps:\/\/doi.org\/10.4121\/16918732.\nGodfray, H.

In the present study, we present an analysis of global cropland area change for the first two decades of the twenty-first century derived from satellite data time-series. We estimate that, in 2019, the cropland area was 1,244\u2009Mha with a corresponding total annual net primary production (NPP) of 5.5\u2009Pg\u2009C\u2009year\u22121. From 2003 to 2019, cropland area increased by 9% and cropland NPP by 25%, primarily due to agricultural expansion in Africa and South America. Global cropland expansion accelerated over the past two decades, with a near doubling of the annual expansion rate, most notably in Africa. Half of the new cropland area (49%) replaced natural vegetation and tree cover, indicating a conflict with the sustainability goal of protecting terrestrial ecosystems. From 2003 to 2019, global per-capita cropland area decreased by 10% due to population growth. However, the per-capita annual cropland NPP increased by 3.5% as a result of intensified agricultural land use. The presented global, high-resolution, cropland map time-series supports monitoring of natural land appropriation at the local, national and international levels.\nGlobal population growth and increasing standards of living inevitably cause the expansion and intensification of global agricultural land use to fulfil growing demands for food, biofuel and other commodities1,2,3. In turn, agriculture expansion and intensification threaten ecosystem functioning and lead to species extinction through habitat loss and fragmentation3,4,5,6. The United Nations\u2019 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) call for balancing increasing agricultural production with maintenance of ecosystem services7. Implementation of SDGs to improve food security, protect freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems, and mitigate climate change requires national policies and international cooperation that are based on consistent, independent and timely data on agriculture extent and productivity8,9. Spatiotemporally consistent satellite observations provide the most accurate and cost-effective solution for global agricultural, land-use mapping and monitoring10. Satellite data have been shown to enable national and global agriculture mapping11,12,13,14,15,16,17. However, no globally consistent, multidecadal, cropland time-series data at locally relevant spatial resolutions (30\u2009m per pixel) exist to date.\nIn the present study, we present a global cropland extent and change dataset that can contribute to monitoring national and global progress towards SDGs. We define cropland as land used for annual and perennial herbaceous crops for human consumption, forage (including hay) and biofuel. Perennial woody crops, permanent pastures and shifting cultivation are excluded from the definition. The fallow length is limited to 4\u2009years for the cropland class. Our definition is largely consistent with the arable land category reported by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the UN18. To create the cropland dataset, we utilized the consistently processed 30\u2009m spatial resolution Landsat satellite data archive19from 2000 to 2019. The Landsat time-series data were transformed into multitemporal metrics that characterize land surface phenology. These metrics were used as independent variables for a machine-learning classification to map global cropland extent. The classification models were locally calibrated using extensive training data collected by visual interpretation of freely available, high-spatial-resolution satellite images. We used a probability sample, stratified based on the Landsat-based global cropland maps, to estimate cropland area and its associated uncertainty, and to analyse pathways of land-use conversion. Sample reference data were collected through visual interpretation of Landsat time-series data and higher-spatial-resolution satellite images. Cropland maps were integrated with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived annual net primary production (NPP)20as a proxy variable for analysing crop productivity. The analysis was performed in 4-year epochs (2000\u20132003, 2004\u20132007, 2008\u20132011, 2012\u20132015 and 2016\u20132019). We created one cropland map per epoch (five maps in total), hereafter referred to by the last year of the interval (for example, the 2019 map represents the 2016\u20132019 epoch).\nUsing probability sample data, we estimated the 2019 global cropland area to be 1,244.2\u2009\u00b1\u200962.7\u2009Mha (the uncertainty represents the 95% confidence interval (CI)). Of the global cropland area, 55% is in Eurasia, 17% in Africa, 16% in North and Central America, 9% in South America and 3% in Australia and New Zealand (Table1; see Extended Data Fig.1for region boundaries). During the first two decades of the twenty-first century, global cropland area increased by 101.9\u2009\u00b1\u200945.1\u2009Mha, equivalent to 9% of the 2003 cropland area (Fig.1). The largest cropland expansion was observed in Africa (by 53.2\u2009\u00b1\u200939.4 Mha, or 34%). South America had the largest relative cropland gain (by 37.1\u2009\u00b1\u20098.7\u2009Mha, or 49%). Australia and New Zealand, as well as south-west Asia, displayed moderate cropland expansion (<0% of the 2003 area). North America, Europe and north and south-east Asia featured small net cropland area change but pronounced gross cropland gain and loss, which balanced each other at the continental scale.\nCropland area was mapped for each 4-year interval. Sample analysis was performed only for the first and the last intervals. The MODIS-based annual NPP represents a 4-year average within the cropland map for the corresponding time interval. The error bars for sample-based cropland area estimates represent the 95% CI whereas the error bars for NPP represent 1\u2009s.d. of annual values within the time interval.\nSource data\nFrom 2003 to 2019, the global population increased by 21% from 6.4 billion to 7.7 billion21. As a result, global per-capita cropland area decreased by 10%, from 0.18\u2009ha per person in 2003 to 0.16\u2009ha per person in 2019. An increase in per-capita cropland area was observed only in South America, while it decreased in all other continents (Fig.2). The largest relative decrease of per-capita cropland area was observed in south-west Asia (by 19%). South-east Asia had the smallest 2019 per-capita cropland area (0.08\u2009ha per person), whereas Australia and New Zealand had the largest (1.34\u2009ha per person).\nThe size of the bubbles reflects regional 2019 cropland area.\nSource data\nA comparison of our 2003 and 2019 sample-based cropland area estimates with national 2003 and 2018 arable land area reported by the FAO22(Extended Data Fig.2) shows sound agreements (R2of 0.94 and 0.98 for the years 2003 and 2019, respectively). Our sample-based cropland area estimate is smaller (by 16% and 11% for 2003 and 2019, respectively) compared with FAO arable land area. The FAO arable land change confirms our findings: both datasets demonstrate a net increase in global cropland area, with Africa and South America showing the largest net gains. The net loss of arable land area in North America, Europe and north and south-west Asia reported by the FAO was not confirmed by our results.\nOf the total 2019 cropland area, 217.5\u2009\u00b1\u200937.7\u2009Mha (17%) represents new cropland established since 2003. In South America and Africa, this proportion is the highest (39% and 34%, respectively). Half of the new croplands replaced natural woody and herbaceous vegetation (49% of gross cropland gain area; Table2). Of that total, 11% represents dryland conversion through irrigation, mostly found in south-west and south-east Asia and North America. The largest proportions of natural vegetation conversion to croplands (excluding dryland irrigation) were found in Africa (79% of all gross cropland gain area), south-east Asia (61%) and South America (39%). Cropland expansion is a major factor of forest loss and wildland fragmentation4,23,24, which illustrates a conflict with SDG 15, specifically, the SDG\u2019s targets to halt deforestation and degradation of natural habitats9. The other half of cropland expansion (51%) was due to pasture conversion and recultivation of abandoned arable land. Nearly all cropland expansion in Australia, New Zealand, Europe and northern Asia was found within pastures and long fallows (with no crop cultivation for >4\u2009years). In North and South America, cropland expansion through the conversion of pastures and long fallows was more common (75% and 61%, respectively) than through clearing of natural vegetation24,25.\nAbandonment or conversion to other land uses affected 10% of the 2003 cropland area (115.5\u2009\u00b1\u200924.1\u2009Mha). Of that area, 52% was either converted into pastures or abandoned (Table2); such conversions may be temporary and followed by crop recultivation years later. Industrial and residential construction and infrastructure development were the second largest driver of gross cropland loss, responsible for 16% of the total cropland area reduction. In south-east Asia, 35% of cropland reduction was due to urban sprawl. A portion (13%) of 2003 cropland was converted to permanent woody crops or aquaculture, with the highest proportion of such transitions in south-east Asia (28%). Flooding caused by surface water increase, water erosion and reservoir construction affected the cropland area on all continents (3% total reduction). The remaining 16% of cropland reduction represented tree plantations or restoration of natural vegetation after cropland abandonment.\nThe global Landsat-based, cropland map time-series is complementary to the sample analysis in characterizing global area dynamics (Fig.3). The sample analysis showed high accuracy of the global cropland maps with variability between regions and lower accuracies for change dynamics (Table3). The cropland map time-series allowed us to disaggregate change over time and conduct national-scale analyses.\nThe map shows the proportion of stable cropland, cropland expansion and cropland reduction within 0.025\u00b0\u2009\u00d7\u20090.025\u00b0 grid cells. The original cropland map time-series has a spatial resolution of 0.00025\u00b0 per pixel, approximately 30\u2009m at the Equator. Country boundaries are from GADM (https:\/\/gadm.org).\nGlobal cropland expansion accelerated over the past two decades, with a near doubling of the annual expansion rate from 5.1\u2009MHa per year to 9.0\u2009Mha per year (Table4). The change in annual cropland expansion rates highlights differences between cropland establishment in Africa and South America. In Africa, cropland expansion accelerated from 2004\u20132007 to 2016\u20132019, with a more than twofold increase in annual expansion rates. In contrast, cropland expansion in South America decelerated by 2019, with an annual expansion rate reduced by almost half compared with the 2004\u20132007 interval.\nAt the national level, the USA had the largest cropland area by 2019, closely followed by India and China (Supplementary Table4). The largest net cropland increases were found in Brazil (by 23.1\u2009Mha, or 77% increase over year 2003 cropland area) and India (by 15.5\u2009Mha or 13%). The largest cropland area reductions were found in Russia (by 5.7\u2009Mha, or 6% decrease over year 2003 cropland area) and Cuba (by 0.5\u2009Mha or 28%).\nPer-country cropland area derived from our 2019 satellite-based map can be compared against the FAO\u2019s arable land estimates for 2018 (ref.22) (R2of 0.97; Extended Data Fig.3a) and with 100-m cropland fraction mapped by the Copernicus Moderate Dynamic Land Cover v.3 dataset17(R2of 0.96; Extended Data Fig.3b). The differences between national cropland estimates for selected countries may be attributed to different factors. We suggest that, in Russia, where crop abandonment is widespread and not fully documented, the arable land is overestimated by the FAO. In Brazil and Paraguay, the Copernicus cropland fraction dataset shows almost twice the size of cropland area compared with our estimate. This overestimation is partly due to misclassification of pastures as croplands by the Copernicus dataset.\nThe global MODIS-derived annual NPP within the cropland area (Extended Data Fig.4) increased by 25% between 2003 and 2019 (from 4.4\u2009Pg\u2009C\u2009year\u22121to 5.5\u2009Pg\u2009C\u2009year\u22121; Fig.1). South America had the highest NPP increase (by 0.38\u2009Pg\u2009C\u2009year\u22121, or 88%) followed by Africa (by 0.29\u2009Pg\u2009C\u2009year\u22121, or 50%) (Table5). The per-capita annual cropland NPP also increased globally by 3.5%, balancing the per-capita cropland area reduction. Two processes contributed to the global cropland NPP increase, namely the increase in cropland area and the increase in crop primary production per unit area. We found that the mean NPP per unit area within stable croplands (croplands presented over the entire 2000\u20132019 interval) increased by 10%, from 402\u2009g C\u2009m\u22122year\u22121in 2003 to 442\u2009g C\u2009m\u22122year\u22121in 2019. The highest NPP increase within stable croplands was found in South America (from 528\u2009g C\u2009m\u22122year\u22121in 2003 to 730\u2009g C\u2009m\u22122year\u22121in 2019, or by 25%). The NPP gain within stable croplands explains 34% of the total cropland NPP increase from 2003 to 2019. Although NPP cannot be used to directly estimate yields, as a measure of vegetation productivity it can be used as an indicator of intensification of crop production.\nThe 2019 global cropland map (Extended Data Fig.5) shows that global cropland distribution and dynamics do not follow national boundaries, but rather reflect agricultural potential, population and land-use history. Major lowland regions of the world have been converted to homogeneous agricultural landscapes, including the Great Plains in North America, the Pampas in South America, the Pontic steppe in Europe, north China and the Manchurian Plains in east Asia, the Indo-Gangetic Plain in south Asia, parts of the Sahel region in Africa and south-east Australia. Cropland expansion in South America occurred synchronously in Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, Bolivia and Uruguay. A similar pattern of simultaneous cropland expansion was observed within Sahelian and Central African countries. In south-west and south-east Asia, cropland gain was mostly found in drylands, whereas tree plantations, orchards, aquaculture and urban areas replaced former croplands in China and the Lower Mekong countries. In Russia, the massive cropland abandonment in the north26was partly compensated by the recent cropland expansion in the southern steppe regions, primarily through fallow land recultivation. The cross-boundary distribution of major cropland areas and synchronous cropland dynamics illustrate the importance of international cooperation to ensure global progress towards SDGs.\nGlobal cropland maps provide spatial context on national, cross-boundary and local cropland dynamics, reflecting the history of land tenure, national policies and abrupt events such as natural and man-made disasters (Extended Data Fig.6). In eastern Europe, the Baltic states and Russia\u2019s Kaliningrad region featured cropland expansion through recultivation of long fallows abandoned after the breakdown of the USSR, whereas the cropland area in neighbouring Poland and Belarus was relatively stable. Cereal, forage and hay production land of the northern Great Plains has different dynamics within Canada, where we observed land abandonment or conversion to permanent pastures, and the USA, where land management has been intensified. The irrigated croplands in Saudi Arabia declined after the depletion of groundwater resources and the implementation of state policies to discourage water-intensive crop production27. The 30-m spatial resolution of the cropland maps supports the analysis of local dynamic factors, for example, cropland abandonment after radioactive contamination following the 2011 nuclear disaster on the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Japan.\nChanges in total and per-capita mapped cropland area from 2003 to 2019 demonstrate the variability of national responses to the need for increased food production to feed a growing population (Extended Data Fig.7). For most countries with moderate cropland area gains, we observed small decreases in per-capita cropland area. In many African nations (for example, Cameroon, Chad, Tanzania and Uganda, among others) the relatively large cropland area increases compensated for population growth and resulted in small changes in per-capita cropland area. In other countries, cropland increase was not adequate to follow population growth, causing a substantial decrease of cropland per capita (for example, in Ethiopia, Nigeria, Pakistan, Senegal and Tajikistan). Per-capita cropland area decreased almost twofold in Niger, which experienced high population growth and slow cropland expansion. Per-capita cropland area reduction can be an indicator of food insecurity in poor countries that rely on subsistence agriculture, whereas rich countries like Saudi Arabia can compensate for cropland area decline with food imports28,29. Several African countries with rapid cropland increase (Angola, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mozambique and Zambia) and South American countries with industrial export-oriented agricultural expansion (Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay and Uruguay) increased per-capita cropland area. The Baltic states of Lithuania and Latvia had the largest increase of cropland per capita due to cropland gain through recultivation of agricultural lands abandoned in the 1990s, coupled with a sharp population decline (>20% reduction since 2000). Despite their small size, these countries are among the top 15 global wheat exporters.\nMore than three-quarters (77%) of the global population live in regions with per-capita cropland area and cropland NPP below the year 2019 global average (Extended Data Fig.8). The lowest per-capita 2019 cropland NPP was in south-west Asia (40% of the global average), which has decreased by 7% since 2003. This finding is aligned with the decrease of per-capita cereal production in western Asia by 14% from 2000 to 2019, reported by the FAO22. The per-capita cropland area in south-east Asia in 2019 was half the global average. In contrast, the per-capita cropland areas and cropland NPP in North America, Europe and north Asia in 2019 were twice the global average. South America had nearly threefold higher per-capita cropland NPP than the global average, and it has increased by 59% since 2003. Although per-capita cropland area and cropland NPP has decreased by >10% in Australia and New Zealand since 2003, the region still led the world in both measures in 2019. Regions with per-capita cropland area and cropland NPP above the global average include the largest grain- and soybean-exporting countries (Australia, Argentina, Brazil, USA and Russia).\nRegional accuracies (Table3) highlight the limitations of the Landsat-based cropland maps. North and South America, which are dominated by large-scale industrial farming, have the highest accuracies. In Europe, Asia and Africa, the global map underestimates cropland area due to spatial resolution limitations in mapping heterogeneous landscapes. Cropland maps in Australia and New Zealand overestimate cropland area due to the inclusion of intensively managed permanent pastures, which are not always separable from crops using Landsat data. In addition, mapping change was shown to be more difficult, with accuracies generally lower across all regions. A probability-based sample analysis is the recommended good practice approach30to estimating the extent of and change in land cover and land use, including croplands. The global cropland map time-series enables a higher sampling efficiency through stratification at the subnational, national and global scales. The difference between our sample-based and map-based cropland area estimates and the arable land area reported by the FAO partly related to the definitional inconsistency. The FAO country reports may include unused arable land and other agricultural land uses10,18, whereas our estimates represent the actively cultivated cropland area.\nThe annual MODIS NPP is the only publicly available, globally consistent data that reflect recent changes in primary production within croplands. NPP correlates with crop yield, biomass production and carbon sequestration, although variation of crop types and management practices precludes direct estimation of the crop yield from cropland NPP31. The MODIS dataset has been shown to underestimate NPP compared with process-based model estimations, especially for irrigated crops32. The difference in spatial resolution between Landsat-based cropland maps and MODIS-based NPP data may impede the analysis of cropland primary production within heterogeneous landscapes. Our Landsat-based, cropland extent time-series data can provide a useful input for improved NPP and crop yield modelling at higher spatial resolution and with better precision.\nHigh-resolution, satellite-based synoptic data on cropland extent and change provide the basis for tracking progress towards sustainable food production and reduction of the environmental impact of agriculture expansion, as well as for applying crop condition monitoring to support decision-making33. Cropland extent is a key variable required to estimate emissions from agriculture and is, therefore, a part of the essential climate variables required for monitoring and modelling the Earth\u2019s climate34. Locally relevant cropland map time-series enable the monitoring of land-use conversion within high-conservation-value ecosystems and protected areas35. The cropland extent map, integrated with other high spatial and temporal resolution data, such as forest change36and surface water extent37, can provide a comprehensive overview of human-induced environmental change, which supports assessing the progress of individual countries towards SDGs.\nThe global boundaries for the cropland mapping were informed by the US Geological Survey (USGS) Global Food Security-Support Analysis Data at 30\u2009m (GFSAD)11. The cropland mapping extent was defined using the geographic 1\u00b0\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u00b0 grid. We included every 1\u00b0\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u00b0 grid cell that contains cropland area according to the GFSAD. Small islands were excluded due to the absence of Landsat geometrically corrected data (Supplementary Fig.1).\nThe cropland mapping was performed at 4-year intervals (2000\u20132003, 2004\u20132007, 2008\u20132011, 2012\u20132015 and 2016\u20132019). Use of a long interval (rather than a single year) increased the number of clear-sky satellite observations in the time-series, which improves representation of land-surface phenology and the accuracy of cropland detection. For each 4-year interval, we mapped an area as cropland if a growing crop was detected during any of these years. In this way, we implemented the criterion of the maximum fallow length: if an area was not used as cropland for >4 years, it was not included in the cropland map for the corresponding time interval.\nWe employed the global 16-day normalized surface reflectance Landsat Analysis Ready Data (Landsat ARD19) as input data for cropland mapping. The Landsat ARD were generated from the entire Landsat archive from 1997 to 2019. The Landsat top-of-atmosphere reflectance was normalized using globally consistent MODIS surface reflectance as a normalization target. Individual Landsat images were aggregated into 16-day composites by prioritizing clear-sky observations.\nFor each 4-year interval, we created a single annualized gap-free 16-day observation time-series. For each 16-day interval, we selected the observation with the highest near-infrared reflectance value (to prioritize observations with the highest vegetation cover) from 4\u2009years of Landsat data. Observations contaminated by haze, clouds and cloud shadows, as indicated by the Landsat ARD quality layer, were removed from the analysis. If no clear-sky data were available for a 16-day interval, we filled the missing reflectance values using linear interpolation.\nThe annualized, 16-day time-series within each 4-year interval were transformed into a set of multitemporal metrics that provide consistent land-surface phenology inputs for global cropland mapping. Metrics include selected ranks, inter-rank averages and amplitudes of surface reflectance and vegetation index values, and surface reflectance averages for selected land-surface phenology stages defined by vegetation indices (that is, surface reflectance for the maximum and minimum greenness periods). The multitemporal metrics methodology is provided in detail19,38. The Landsat metrics were augmented with elevation data39. In this way, we created spatially consistent inputs for each of the 4-year intervals. The complete list of input metrics is presented in Supplementary Table1.\nGlobal cropland mapping included three stages that enabled extrapolation of visually delineated cropland training data to a temporally consistent, global cropland map time-series using machine learning. At all three stages, we employed bagged decision tree ensembles40as a supervised classification algorithm that used class presence and absence data as the dependent variables, and a set of multitemporal metrics as independent variables at a Landsat ARD pixel scale. The bagged decision tree results in a per-pixel cropland probability layer, which has a threshold of 0.5 to obtain a cropland map.\nThe first stage consisted of performing individual cropland classifications for a set of 924 Landsat ARD 1\u00b0\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u00b0 tiles for the 2016\u20132019 interval (Supplementary Fig.1). The tiles were chosen to represent diverse global agriculture landscapes. Classification training data (cropland class presence and absence) were manually selected through visual interpretation of Landsat metric composites and high-resolution data from Google Earth. An individual supervised classification model (bagged decision trees) was calibrated and applied to each tile.\nAt the second stage, we used the 924 tiles that had been classified as cropland\/other land and the 2016\u20132019 metric set to train a series of regional cropland mapping models. The classification was iterated by adding training tiles and assessing the results until the resulting map was satisfactory. We then applied the regional models to each of the preceding 4-year intervals, thus creating a preliminary time-series of global cropland maps.\nAt the third stage, we used the preliminary global cropland maps as training data to generate temporally consistent global cropland data. As the regional models applied at the second stage were calibrated using 2016\u20132019 data alone, classification errors may arise due to Landsat data inconsistencies before 2016. The goal of this third stage was to create a robust spatiotemporally consistent set of locally calibrated cropland detection models. For each 1\u00b0\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u00b0 Landsat ARD tile (13,451 tiles total), we collected training data for each 4-year interval from the preliminary cropland extent maps within a 3\u00b0 radius of the target tile, with preference to select stable cropland and non-cropland pixels as training. Training data from all intervals were used to calibrate a single decision tree ensemble for each ARD tile. The per-tile models were then applied to each time interval, and the results were post-processed to remove single cropland class detections and omissions within time-series and eliminate cropland patches <0.5\u2009ha. Manual masks to remove map artefacts (for example, cropland overestimation over temperate wetlands and flooded grasslands) were applied in some regions to improve the map quality. The final global cropland map time-series are available athttps:\/\/glad.umd.edu\/dataset\/croplands.\nThe sample analysis had two objectives: to estimate cropland area and its associated uncertainty and to assess cropland map accuracy. Sample interpretation and sample-based analysis were done only for the start (2003) and the end (2019) of the cropland-mapping interval. Accuracies of intermediate cropland maps (2007, 2011 and 2015) were not assessed, but were considered to be similar to those of the 2003 and 2019 maps due to implementation of the same classification model and consistently processed Landsat data41. The analysis was performed separately for each of the seven regions outlined in Extended Data Fig.1, as well as globally. The regional boundaries were aligned with national boundaries to enable comparison with national data. Only land pixels were considered; pixels labelled as permanent water and snow\/ice in the Landsat ARD data quality layer were excluded. In each region, we selected five strata based on the map time-series corresponding to stable croplands, cropland gain and loss, possible cropland omission area and other lands (Supplementary Tables2and3). The possible cropland omission stratum (stratum 4) includes areas where omission errors are probable, specifically pixels that were not mapped as cropland and either (1) were identified as crops by the GFSAD11or (2) had the decision tree-based cropland probability between 0.1 and 0.5. We randomly selected 100 sample units (Landsat data pixels) from each stratum (500 samples pixels per region, 3,500 in total).\nSample interpretation was performed visually using available remotely sensed data time-series, including Landsat ARD 16-day data, composites of selected multitemporal metrics and high-resolution images provided by Google Earth (Supplementary Fig.2). Each sample pixel was interpreted by two experts independently and the disagreements were discussed and resolved by the research team. The interpretation legend includes the 2003\u20132019 cropland dynamics categories and land-use transition types. The sample reference data and interpretation results are available athttps:\/\/glad.umd.edu\/dataset\/croplands.\nThe sample-based area estimation was performed following previously published methods42,43. The 2003 and 2019 total cropland area, stable crops, gross cropland loss and gain, and net change were estimated within each region separately, and for the entire world using equation (1). The area and the total number of Landsat pixels for each region and each stratum are provided in Supplementary Table3. For each of the 100 sample pixels sampled in each stratum,puwas defined by class presence, for example, for 2003 cropland,pu=\u20090 (2003 cropland absence) orpu=\u20091 (2003 cropland presence). Thepuwas defined similarly for the 2019 cropland, stable crop, gross cropland loss and gain classes. For the net cropland area change,puhad values of 1 (cropland gain), \u22121 (cropland loss) and 0 (no change).\nwhere\\(\\hat A\\)is the estimated cropland\/cropland change area,\nAhthe area of stratumh,\nHthe number of sampling strata,\n\\(\\bar p_h = \\frac{{\\mathop {\\sum }\\nolimits_{u \\in h} p_u}}{{n_h}}\\)the mean cropland\/cropland change proportion of samples in stratumh; and\nnhthe sample size (number of sample pixels) in stratumh.\nThe s.e.m. of the area was estimated from the variances of cropland (or cropland dynamics category) class values ofpufor sample pixels in each stratum using equation (2). The 95% CI was obtained by multiplying s.e.m. by 1.96:\nwhere\\({\\mathrm{s.e.}}\\left( {\\hat A} \\right)\\)is the s.e.m. of cropland\/cropland change class area and\n\\(s_{ph}^2 = \\frac{{\\mathop {\\sum }\\nolimits_{u \\in h} \\left( {p_u - \\bar p_h} \\right)^2}}{{n_h - 1}}\\)the sample variance for stratumh.\nWe analysed the land-use trajectories of cropland loss and gain using reference sample data within cropland gain and loss strata only. Inclusion of sample pixels from other strata where cropland change was detected would have inflated the area of land-use trajectories that these pixels represent (that is, if a sample pixel from a stable cropland stratum was interpreted as cropland gain due to forest clearing, including the proportion of forest clearing from this large stratum, it will dominate the total regional estimate). The proportion of each land-use trajectory (within cropland gain and loss separately) was estimated from the sample and reported as the percentage of the total gain or loss along with its s.e.m. (Table2). A combined ratio estimator for stratified random sampling43was employed to estimate the percentages (equation (3)).\nwhere:\\(\\hat R\\)is the estimated class proportion expressed as a percentage;\nHthe number of sampling strata;\nAhthe area of stratumh;\n\\(\\bar y_h = \\frac{{\\mathop {\\sum}\\nolimits_{u \\in h} {y_u} }}{{n_h}}\\)the sample mean of theyuvalues in stratumh, whereyu=\u20091 if pixeluis classified as belonging to a specific transition in the reference sample interpretation, andyu=\u20090 otherwise; and\n\\(\\bar x_h = \\frac{{\\mathop {\\sum}\\nolimits_{u \\in h} {x_u} }}{{n_h}}\\)the sample mean of thexuvalues in stratumh, wherexu=\u20091 if pixeluis classified as any cropland loss\/gain in the reference sample interpretation, andxu=\u20090 otherwise.\nThe s.e.m. of the estimated ratio of class proportion expressed as percentage was calculated using equation (4):\nwhere:\\({\\mathrm{s.e.}}\\left( {\\hat R} \\right)\\)is the s.e.m. of the estimated proportion expressed as a percentage;\nNhthe total number of pixels in stratumh;\nnhnumber of sample pixels in stratumh;\n\\(\\hat X = \\mathop {\\sum }\\limits_{h = 1}^H A_h\\bar x_h\\)the estimated total area of cropland loss\/gain expressed in area units; and\n\\(s_{yh}^2\\)and\\(s_{xh}^2\\)the sample variances in stratumh; andsxyhthe sample covariance in stratumhestimated as follows:\nThe map accuracy metrics include overall accuracy (the proportion of correctly mapped sample pixels), user\u2019s accuracy of the cropland class (which reflects the cropland class commission) and producer\u2019s accuracy of the cropland class (which reflects the cropland class omission)42. All accuracy metrics and respective s.e.m.s are presented as percentages (Table3).\nTo estimate overall accuracy, we definedyu=\u20091 if pixel u is classified correctly andyu=\u20090 if pixeluis classified incorrectly. The estimator for overall accuracy is then expressed by equation (5), and s.e.m. for overall accuracy is computed using equation (6).\nwhere:\\(\\hat O\\)is the estimated overall accuracy, expressed as a percentage;Hthe number of sampling strata;Nhthe total number of pixels in stratumh;Nthe total number of pixels in the reporting region; and\\(\\bar y_h = \\mathop {\\sum }\\limits_{u \\in h} y_u\/n_h\\)the sample mean of theyuvalues in stratumh.\nwhere\\({\\mathrm{s.e.}}\\left( {\\hat O} \\right)\\)is the s.e.m. of the overall accuracy, expressed as percentage;nhthe number of sample pixels in stratumh; and\\(s_{yh}^2\\)the sample variance:\\(s_{yh}^2 = \\mathop {\\sum }\\limits_{u \\in h} \\left( {y_u - \\bar y_h} \\right)^2\/(n_h - 1).\\)For estimating user\u2019s accuracy of the croplands class, we definedyu=\u20091 if sample pixeluis correctly mapped as cropland, otherwiseyu=\u20090, andxu=\u20091 if sample pixeluis mapped cropland, otherwisexu=\u20090. For the producer\u2019s accuracy, we definedyu=\u20091 if sample pixeluis correctly mapped as cropland, otherwiseyu=\u20090, andxu=\u20091 if sample pixeluis interpreted as cropland, otherwisexu=\u20090. The estimator of the user\u2019s accuracy and producer\u2019s accuracy was then expressed as a ratio estimator (equation (7)) and their s.e.m. calculated using equation (8), which are similar to equations (3) and (4), except that the strata were weighted by their total number of pixels (Nh) rather than the areas (Ah) for the purposes of map accuracy assessment (with pixel being the primary mapping unit):\nwhere\\(\\hat R\\)is the estimated user\u2019s\/producer\u2019s accuracy, expressed as a percentage.\nwhere\\({\\mathrm{s.e.}}\\left( {\\hat R} \\right)\\)is the s.e.m. of the estimated user\u2019s\/producer\u2019s accuracy, expressed as a percentage.\n\\(\\hat X = \\mathop {\\sum }\\limits_{h = 1}^H N_h\\bar x_h.\\)\nThe cropland NPP was evaluated using the globally consistent Collection 6 MODIS-based, annual year-end gap-filled NPP product (MOD17A3HGF20). The product provides the sum of total daily NPP through the year at a 500-m spatial resolution (kg\u2009C\u2009m\u22122year\u22121). The annual NPP data were resampled to our Landsat ARD data grid and were overlaid with the corresponding 4-year cropland maps to calculate total and per-unit area NPP for each region and each year. We used average annual NPP for each 4-year interval, except for the 2000\u20132003 interval, where a 3-year average was used instead to avoid using the year 2000 when MODIS data were incomplete. The s.d. of the annual estimates is provided as an uncertainty metric.\nFor the national cropland area analysis, we used public geographic information systems (GIS) country boundaries from GADM (https:\/\/gadm.org).\nWe employed the 2019 Revision of World Population Prospects21to calculate global, regional and national population for years 2003 and 2019. As the boundaries of analysis regions (Extended Data Fig.1) are aligned with country boundaries, we were able to summarize the regional population totals from national data. The population data were related to our sample-based (for global and regional estimates) and map-based (for national estimates) cropland area to estimate per-capita cropland area and change. Similarly, we related regional cropland NPP to population data to estimate per-capita cropland NPP for 2003 and 2019.\nFurther information on research design is available in theNature Research Reporting Summarylinked to this article.\nThe global cropland maps for 2003, 2007, 2011, 2015 and 2019, cropland dynamic maps (net cropland gain and loss) and sample data are publicly available fromhttps:\/\/glad.umd.edu\/dataset\/croplands.

In this retrospective longitudinal study including UK and US participants, we collected diet and lifestyle data pre-pandemic (896,286) and peri-pandemic (291,871) using a mobile health app, and we computed a bidirectional health behaviour disruption index. Disruption of health behaviour was higher in younger, female and socio-economically deprived participants. Loss in body weight was greater in highly disrupted individuals than in those with low disruption. There were large inter-individual changes observed in 46 health and diet behaviours measured peri-pandemic compared with pre-pandemic, but no mean change in the total population. Individuals most adherent to less healthy pre-pandemic health behaviours improved their diet quality and weight compared with those reporting healthier pre-pandemic behaviours, irrespective of relative deprivation; therefore, for a proportion of the population, the pandemic may have provided an impetus to improve health behaviours. Public policies to tackle health inequalities widened by the pandemic should continue to prioritize diet and physical activity for all, as well as more targeted approaches to support younger females and those living in economically deprived areas.\nMandatory public health initiatives to control and limit the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have led to dramatic changes in day-to-day routines, resulting in increased social isolation1,2, employment and financial insecurities3, and an altered food environment4. This places most of the world\u2019s population in a unique global experiment on a massive scale. Small European-based studies have observed the exacerbation of unfavourable diet and lifestyle behaviours attributable to these changes, such as increased sedentary behaviour, more snacking, less fresh food consumption and weight gain, although the published data are inconclusive5,6,7.\nAt an individual level, major life events are associated with changes in health behaviours such as alcohol intake8, sleep9,10, diet11,12and physical activity13. The complex interrelation of these health behaviours potentially mediates increases in body weight observed during adulthood14,15,16, impacting the number of adults living with excess weight and consequent morbidities17,18,19,20, which is a significant public health threat21. Understanding how health behaviours change in the context of a prolonged pandemic is therefore critical to improve our understanding of its long-term consequences.\nIn a retrospective longitudinal observational cohort study of 896,286 participants from the ZOE COVID Study, we describe the self-reported impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on diet and health behaviours using a composite disruption index (DI). We determine the association of diet and lifestyle behaviours with weight change during the pandemic, and we explore the relationship between pre-pandemic behavioural patterns and changes in specific diet and lifestyle behaviours.\nThere were large inter-individual changes observed in all of the 46 health and diet behaviours measured peri-pandemic versus pre-pandemic, but no mean change was observed in the total population. Individuals most adherent to less healthy pre-pandemic diet and health behaviours were more inclined to improve their overall diet quality and lose weight, irrespective of relative deprivation, while those most adherent to healthier pre-pandemic behaviours exhibited little change in health behaviours. Disruption of health behaviours resulting from the pandemic was higher in the younger, female and socio-economically deprived segments of the population. However, greater disruption was associated with more variable change in weight and greater weight loss compared with less disrupted individuals, suggesting that the disruption resulted in more favourable diet and lifestyle changes for some people. Structural equation modelling revealed that changes in physical activity and diet quality during the pandemic were the most relevant factors associated with weight change.\nOur data provide quantitative evidence about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on lifestyle behaviours and indicate that the perceived negative impact of the pandemic on health behaviours, and factors that exacerbate this, may not hold true for all people22. Indeed, the pandemic may have provided the impetus to improve many diet and lifestyle behaviours among a large proportion of the population.\nWithin the ZOE COVID Study, we launched a diet and lifestyle retrospective longitudinal observational cohort study (from 31 July to 25 September 2020 in the United Kingdom and from 25 September to 30 November 2020 in the United States). The participants were invited to complete a retrospective questionnaire (Methods) assessing diet quality, diet habits and lifestyle behaviours at two time points: (1) peri-pandemic (the previous month before participant access) and (2) pre-pandemic (the month of February 2020). Baseline participant characteristics including demographics and comorbidities were also assessed from the ZOE COVID Study23. For the UK data, the index of multiple deprivation (IMD), considered a surrogate measure of deprivation across several domains (including income, employment and education) by geographical region24, was assigned to the participants.\nAfter the exclusion of replicates, individuals <18 years old, pregnant women, non-UK and non-US participants and implausible anthropometric measures (Methods), data were available forn=\u2009896,286 peri-pandemic andn=\u2009291,871 pre- and peri-pandemic participants.\nThe characteristics of the participants who completed the diet and lifestyle survey peri-pandemic are summarized in Table1and Supplementary Tables1and2. Compared with the average UK population (Supplementary Table1), the UK participants who completed the survey were older (mean age 52 versus 41 years), had a lower body mass index (BMI) (25 versus 27\u2009kg\u2009m\u22122), resided in less deprived areas (for IMD range 8\u201310, 40% versus 30%; for IMD range 1\u20133, 10% versus 30%) and were less likely to smoke. The proportions of males and non-white UK ethnicities were also lower among the surveyed UK participants than in the general population (33% versus 49% and 4% versus 14%, respectively). The proportions of respondents across geographical regions in the United Kingdom were broadly similar to the UK population distribution. Similar patterns were observed for the US cohort (Table1and Supplementary Table1).\nPrior to data analysis, the UK cohort was divided into discovery (n=\u2009380,847) and validation (n=\u2009448,321) sets, owing to slight differences in data collection processes (Methodsand Supplementary Table2). Data from 67,118 participants from the United States were used as an independent replication cohort (Methods).\nTo quantify lifestyle disruption attributable to the pandemic, we computed a DI including five metrics: diet quality score (DQS)25, alcohol frequency, physical activity, snacking frequency (food consumed outside of main meals) and weekday sleep duration (Methods). These domains were selected to capture the primary diet and lifestyle behaviours associated with multiple health outcomes, including obesity26,27,28,29,30,31. The DI was independent of the direction of change, ranged from 0 (no disruption) to 5 (change in all five domains) and approximated a normal distribution (Fig.1a). In the UK discovery cohort (n=\u2009201,301; pre- and peri-pandemic data), most participants experienced a moderate level of disruption (65%; DI\u2009\u2265\u20092), while 15% had a high level of disruption (DI\u2009\u2265\u20094). The DI (Fig.1a) differed (chi-squared test) according to sex (P<\u20090.001; effect size, 0.122), age category (P<\u20090.001; effect size, 0.268), assigned level of deprivation (P<\u20090.001; effect size, 0.050) and geographical location (P<\u20090.001; effect size, 0.014), with greater DIs among younger individuals, females and participants living in more deprived areas. Similar patterns were observed for the US replication cohort (n=\u200914,473; pre- and peri-pandemic data). Participant characteristics according to the DI scores for the United Kingdom and United States are detailed in Supplementary Table3.\na, Community-level DI on a scale of 0 to 5 including five domains (DQS, snacking frequency, alcohol intake frequency, physical activity and weekday sleep duration), stratified according to sex, age and IMD based on residence in the UK cohort (n=\u2009201,301).b, Change in body weight during the pandemic (pre- minus peri-pandemic values) stratified according to low (\u22641) or high (\u22654) DI in the UK discovery (n=\u2009201,301) and US replication cohorts (n=\u200914,473), coefficient of variation for those with high DI (UK discovery cohort, 2,130%; US replication cohort, 2,288%) and coefficient of variation for those with a low DI (UK discovery cohort, 1,488%; US replication cohort, 970%).c,d, Geographical distribution of DI (c) and change in weight (d) in the UK discovery cohort (n=\u2009201,301). The data are provided in Supplementary Table3.\nFor body weight change (in the UK discovery cohort (n=\u2009201,301; pre- and peri- pandemic data)), only a small mean change (mean (10th percentile, 90th percentile)) of \u22120.2 (\u22124.4, 3.6) kg was observed. However, body weight change was highly variable among individuals, with 33% of participants losing a mean of 4.4 (\u22128.6, \u22120.9)\u2009kg and 34% gaining a mean of 3.7 (0.9, 6.4)\u2009kg during the pandemic (Supplementary Table4). A similar pattern and magnitude of change was also observed for the UK validation and US replication cohorts (Supplementary Table4).\nA greater disruption was associated with a larger and more variable bidirectional change in weight (both loss and gain) in both the UK and US cohorts (Fig.1band Supplementary Table3). Weight loss and gain in the high DI group (mean (10th percentile, 90th percentile)) was \u22125.5 (\u221211.0, \u22121.0) kg and 4.2 (1.0, 8.0) kg, respectively, compared with \u22123.5 (\u22126.4, \u22120.9) kg and 3.3 (0.5, 5.4) kg, respectively, in the low DI group (allP<\u20090.001).\nAfter adjusting for potential confounders (age and sex), the pattern of association between the DI and weight changes was similar but stronger among individuals living in areas with low deprivation (IMD, 8\u201310;\u03b2=\u2009\u22120.035; 95% confidence interval, \u22120.217, \u22120.145) compared with high deprivation (IMD, 1\u20133;\u03b2=\u2009\u22120.021; 95% confidence interval, \u22120.153, \u22120.058). When stratified according to DI group and deprivation index, there was a similar magnitude of weight loss between levels of deprivation, and only a moderately higher weight gain in the UK group residing in more deprived areas (4.4\u2009kg) versus the group in less deprived areas (4.0\u2009kg) within the highly disrupted group (Supplementary Table3). This observation suggests that community-level deprivation factors may not impair the potential positive behavioural effects of disruption but may exacerbate the negative effects to a small extent, with individuals living in more deprived areas being more susceptible to weight gain.\nThe association of changes in the five lifestyle behaviour domains captured by the DI and age32with body weight change (bidirectional) was examined using structural equation modelling (Fig.2a,d). For individuals who gained weight (n=\u200968,607), reductions in physical activity, diet quality and sleep and an increase in snacking were moderately associated with weight gain. Among individuals who lost weight (n=\u200965,327), contrasting associations were observed with an additional moderate association of reduced alcohol frequency with weight loss. This trend remained when examined within strata of community-level deprivation, except for sleep, which was not associated with weight gain or loss in those living in more deprived areas (Supplementary Table5and Fig.2b,c,e,f). In accordance with most population-based strategies, our results show that diet quality and physical activity can be promising targets to prevent weight gain across all socio-economic classes during a global pandemic.\na\u2013f, Structural equation modelling showing the associations between exposures identified by machine learning and outcome (body weight increase\/decrease): overall increase (n=\u200968,607) (a), body weight increase in the subpopulation in low deprivation areas (IMD 8\u201310;n=\u200928,054) (b), body weight increase in the subpopulation in high deprivation areas (IMD 1\u20133;n=\u20096,779) (c), overall decreased body weight (n=\u200965,327) (d), body weight decrease in the subpopulation in low deprivation areas (IMD 8\u201310;n=\u200928,015) (e) and body weight decrease in the subpopulation in high deprivation areas (IMD 1\u20133;n=\u20095,533) (f).

Figure created with BioRender.com.\nTo determine any differential effect of pre-pandemic weight on the relationship between the DI components and weight change, we also stratified according to normal weight (BMI\u2009<\u200925\u2009kg\u2009m\u22122;n=\u200997,915) and overweight\/obese (BMI\u2009\u2265\u200925\u2009kg\u2009m\u22122;n=\u2009103,386) (Supplementary Table4). Reductions in physical activity and DQS and an increase in snacking were most closely associated with weight gain in both groups, with a stronger association in the overweight\/obese individuals (\u03b2=\u2009\u22120.055, \u22120.044 and 0.05, respectively, allP<\u20090.05) versus normal-weight individuals (\u03b2=\u2009\u22120.014, \u22120.019 and 0.028, respectively, allP<\u20090.05).\nThere was minimal population average change in all diet and lifestyle variables in response to the pandemic (in the UK and US cohorts) but large individual-level changes (Table2, Fig.3a\u2013cand Supplementary Tables4,6and7). For example, in the UK discovery cohort (n=\u2009201,301), despite minimal mean change in the DQS (mean (10th percentile, 90th percentile), 0.2 (\u22122.0, 2.0)), more participants increased their score (37% by a mean of 1.7 (1.0, 3.0)) than decreased it (26% by a mean of \u22121.6 (\u22123.0, \u22121.0)). Likewise, a higher proportion of participants (31.0%) increased their daily fruit and vegetable portions (by mean 1.85 (1.0, 3.0), from 4.3 (0.2, 7.0) to 6.1 (3.5, 9.0) portions per day) than decreased them (22.0%) (by mean \u22121.68 (\u22123.0, \u22121.0), from 6.04 (3.0, 9.0) to 4.35 (2.0, 7.0) portions per day), consistent with a level that would confer significant health effects27,33. There was only a minimal mean change in the number of snacks consumed per day (by mean \u22120.1 (\u22121.0, 1.0)), but a large number of individuals increased their intake (16%; by mean 1.4 snacks per day (1.0, 2.0) (from 1.1 per day)) and decreased their intake (23%; by mean \u22121.4 snacks per day (\u22122.0, \u22121.0) (from 2.6 per day)). More people increased their weekday sleep (15%) than decreased it (9%), although the magnitude of change was similar (mean \u00b11.2\u2009h). Interestingly, for frequency of alcohol intake, the proportion of people increasing (18.2%) was greater than the proportion decreasing (11.2%), while the inverse was the case for the amount consumed at each drinking event (10.6% increasing versus 13.4% decreasing units), suggesting that the total amount of alcohol consumption (frequency\u2009\u00d7\u2009units) may have been unchanged. Notably, most participants reported no change (92.8%) in food access, probably a reflection of the survey demographic, although more participants reported a decrease in food access (5.8%) than an increase (1.4%).\na\u2013c, Percentage of the cohort that changed (increased\/decreased) the frequency of dietary intake and lifestyle behaviours from pre-pandemic to peri-pandemic, obtained from the amended LSF-FFQ and others, in the UK discovery (n=\u2009201,301) (a), UK validation (n=\u200975,840) (b) and US replication (n=\u200914,473) cohorts (c). The data are provided in Supplementary Table6.\nA similar pattern of change in the individual variables was observed in the UK validation cohort and US replication cohort except for physical activity levels. In the United Kingdom, the proportions of participants increasing and decreasing their physical activity were similar (in both cohorts), yet in the United States, the proportion of participants decreasing their physical activity (35.4%) was greater than those increasing it (24.6%) (Table2and Fig.3). The moderately greater magnitude of change in the UK validation and US replication cohorts than in the UK discovery cohort is probably a consequence of the different data collection methods (Methods). All other variables from the questionnaire, including full Leeds Short Form Food Frequency Questionnaire (LSF-FFQ) data, are reported for pre- and peri-pandemic (as well as the change) in Supplementary Tables4,6and7.\nTo explore the impact of pre-pandemic diet and lifestyle behaviours on the variable response to the pandemic, we undertook a factor analysis (Methods) identifying two distinct diet and lifestyle patterns labelled as \u2018healthier\u2019 and \u2018less healthy\u2019 on the basis of items and loadings summarized in Fig.4and Supplementary Table8.\na\u2013d, Loadings (\u22650.1) for \u2018healthier\u2019 (a) and \u2018less healthy\u2019 (b) patterns in the UK discovery cohort (n=\u2009201,301) and \u2018healthier\u2019 (c) and \u2018less healthy\u2019 (d) patterns in the US replication cohort (n=\u200914,473). A full breakdown of the loading of each diet and health behaviour variable for the \u2018healthier\u2019 and \u2018less healthy\u2019 patterns can be seen in Supplementary Table8.\nParticipants\u2019 demographic and behavioural characteristics differed between quartiles (n=\u200950,497 per quartile) of the diet and lifestyle patterns (Supplementary Tables9and10). In the United Kingdom, those with the highest adherence to the \u2018healthier\u2019 pattern (quartile 4 (Q4) versus Q1) were on average older (61 versus 53 years), less likely to smoke (1.2% versus 3.9%) and more likely to reside in an area with a lower level of deprivation (44.8% versus 37.7% with IMD 8\u201310) than those with the lowest adherence (allP<\u20090.001) (Table3). A broadly similar pattern was observed in the US replication cohort (Supplementary Table9).\nIndividuals most adherent to the \u2018less healthy\u2019 pattern lost more weight than those reporting higher adherence to the \u2018healthier\u2019 pattern (by 1.1\u2009kg) (Table3). The same trends of association were observed in other diet and lifestyle measures (for both the UK and US cohorts), with larger increases in weeknight sleep, DQS, and fruit and vegetable consumption and a larger decrease in the number of snacks among those most adherent to the \u2018less healthy\u2019 pattern compared with the \u2018healthier\u2019 lifestyle pattern. These findings suggest that participants with less healthy behaviours in the pre-pandemic phase were more likely to implement healthy changes. This may be a consequence of a greater scope for improvement in the \u2018less healthy\u2019 group, while those classified as having a healthy pre-pandemic lifestyle pattern tended to retain their beneficial health behaviours and experienced minimal change. This observation was also reflected in those with a lower DI typically being highly adherent to the \u2018healthier\u2019 pattern while those with a higher DI tended to be adherent to the \u2018less healthy\u2019 pattern (bothP<\u20090.001).\nTo assess whether the population demographics were driving this finding, in the United Kingdom, we stratified individuals most adherent to the \u2018less healthy\u2019 pattern according to their community-level deprivation, age, sex and constituent countries. When stratified according to deprivation (IMD 1\u20133 versus 8\u201310), the improvement in diet quality (0.92 versus 0.94 units) and reduction in body weight (\u22120.71 versus \u22120.99\u2009kg) remained, although attenuated. Age, sex and country also had only small impacts on the change in weight (aged 18\u201325\u2009yr, \u22121.46\u2009kg; versus aged >65\u2009yr, \u22120.58\u2009kg; male, \u22121.16\u2009kg; versus female, \u22120.70\u2009kg; England, \u22120.89\u2009kg; versus Wales, \u22120.81\u2009kg; versus Scotland, \u22120.69\u2009kg; versus Northern Ireland, \u22120.43\u2009kg) and minimal impacts on DQS (aged 18\u201325\u2009yr, 0.88; versus aged >65\u2009yr, 0.82; England, 0.94; versus Wales, 0.98; versus Scotland, 0.90; versus Northern Ireland, 0.70). Therefore, irrespective of community-level deprivation, age, sex and location, individuals most adherent to a \u2018less healthy\u2019 pre-pandemic pattern experienced beneficial changes in diet quality and weight. Consequentially, our data suggest apparent positive diet and lifestyle changes related to the COVID-19 pandemic for a large proportion of the study demographic.\nThe changes in daily routine due to national and local measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic could be viewed as a unique natural experiment of lifestyle disruption, health behaviour change and associated longer-term health outcomes for individuals and populations. We have described the impact of the pandemic on lifestyle behaviour changes in samples of the UK and US populations using data from the largest survey of diet and lifestyle during the pandemic to date.\nThe disruption of health behaviours by the pandemic, which was more pronounced in females, younger participants and those residing in more deprived areas, was associated with a higher and more variable bidirectional change in body weight. This observation is a likely consequence of unpaid care and family responsibilities falling disproportionately to women, particularly younger females, with women over-represented in lower-income households34.\nAlthough we observed no mean changes in diet and lifestyle behaviours in the total population, considerable inter-individual variation exists upon stratifying the data. This variability in the responses of individual health behaviours and weight changes to COVID-19, in concert with minimal mean population change, is in agreement with studies exploring the impact of comparable mandatory public health interventions across Europe5,6,35,36. While direct comparisons between countries can prove difficult due to differences in populations, government lockdown strategies and dietary habits (among other factors), these results suggest some similarities in terms of behaviour change.\nMost surprisingly, those participants who were identified to have a \u2018less healthy\u2019 pattern pre-pandemic were more likely to experience improvements in diet quality and greater weight loss peri-pandemic, irrespective of deprivation status. While this may reflect some bias due to the users of the app being self-selected and typically of a higher socio-economic demographic than the average UK and US citizen, the NutriNet-Sante study also observed that positive health behaviour changes were associated with less healthy pre-pandemic behaviours5. Therefore, for a significant proportion of the population, the pandemic may not have had the detrimental impact on diet and lifestyle behaviours that has previously been speculated and reported in the media37,38.\nExcess body weight has been linked with an increase of COVID-19 severity39,40and chronic disease mortality41and is known to be interrelated with social determinants of health, including systematic racism42and disparities in food security and socio-economic status43,44. Bidirectional weight changes were observed between groups stratified by levels of deprivation, with those reporting less healthy behaviours and residing in more deprived areas experiencing more weight gain than those residing in less deprived areas. However, irrespective of deprivation, physical activity and diet quality were identified as key determinants of short-term weight gain and loss. It is noteworthy that the mean change in body weight was greater than typical daily body weight fluctuations45and, for some, a weight loss of a magnitude to confer improved metabolic function46.\nAs highlighted in the Foresight Report, weight gain and obesity are the result of complex system interactions47; it therefore may be reasonable to assume that the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted many active components across multiple domains. From a public health perspective, future research questions should focus on identifying the higher-level disruptions that impact individual health behaviours\u2014for example, working from home, reduced commuting, food availability, structural inequalities or societal influences. These pose the following questions: if we can identify facilitators and barriers to health behaviour changes, how sustainable are these changes? Furthermore, if body weight changes are maintained in the long term, are they associated with corresponding improvements in metabolic health?\nWhile this study had multiple strengths, including sample size, an independent replication cohort and longitudinal data, we note several limitations. The first is the self-reported nature of the data collected, with the potential of recall bias and the unknown impact of COVID-19 on retrospective data collection48. Further limitations include the data collection methods, which were modified part-way through the study to minimize participant burden and decrease attrition (Methods), although sensitivity analysis displayed minimal population characteristic differences. Additionally, the DI is a crude bidirectional index composed of only five behaviours. Further work is needed to determine how the direction of change in the individual components may contribute to health outcomes. Considerations for future studies would be to collect data on level of isolation, mental health, comorbidities, job role and furlough status to assist in the interpretation of lifestyle behaviour changes in response to COVID-19. The generalizability of our findings to a wider population sample also needs to be determined, given the differences in age, IMD and ethnicity of the ZOE COVID Study cohort compared with the general population. Regression to the mean can be problematic in studies that focus on assessing changes in behaviours in subgroups of the population where only a single follow-up assessment is made. Thus, to some extent, the improvements in health behaviours seen in people recording the least healthy behaviours at baseline could be artificial improvements. Nevertheless, the same degree of change was not observed in people who reported the most healthy baseline behaviours, reinforcing the argument that changes in health seen in either group are likely to be real.\nIn conclusion, this large population-based study has demonstrated that the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted individuals differently, with those most disrupted being more susceptible to weight change.\nThe ZOE COVID Symptom Study mobile application was developed by the technology company ZOE in collaboration with King\u2019s College London, UK, and Massachusetts General Hospital, USA. It was made available for free download for Apple and Android users (on 24 March 2020 in the United Kingdom and on 29 March 2020 in the United States). The application offers a guided interface developed using Expo and ReactNative (JavaScript). The participants were requested to report information including baseline demographics, comorbidities, daily symptoms and COVID-19 testing outcomes.\nUsing the ZOE COVID Study app, a longitudinal, retrospective, observational cohort study investigating diet quality, diet habits and lifestyle changes before and during the pandemic was launched (from 31 July to 25 September 2020 in the United Kingdom and from 25 September to 30 November 2020 in the United States). The participants were recruited via the app interface. At enrolment, the participants consented to the use of their information for research investigations related to COVID-19, diet and lifestyle, and to applicable privacy policies and terms of use. The study was approved by Partners Human Research Committee (protocol no. 2020P000909) and King\u2019s College London ethics committee (REMAS ID 18210; LRS-19\/20-18210). The ZOE COVID Study app is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04331509. Data collected in the app are being shared with other health researchers through the NHS-funded Health Data Research UK (HDRUK)\/SAIL Consortium, housed in the UK Secure e-Research Platform in Swansea, Wales. Anonymized data are available to be shared with bona fide researchers through HDRUK according to their protocols in the public interest. US investigators are encouraged to coordinate data requests through the Coronavirus Pandemic Epidemiology (COPE) Consortium (www.monganinstitute.org\/cope-consortium).\nInformation obtained through the ZOE COVID Study mobile application has been described in detail previously23,49. The participants were requested to complete a retrospective questionnaire investigating diet quality, diet habits and lifestyle at two time points: (1) peri-pandemic, described as the previous month (from user access), and (2) pre-pandemic, described as the month of February 2020. The sections contained identical sets of questions collated by the research team and included the validated LSF-FFQ25developed by Cleghorn and listed in the Nutritools (www.nutritools.org) library (Supplementary Information).\nThe user experience was drafted in a requirements document by the engineering and product team at ZOE. A designer laid out a format optimized for mobile and tablet devices. The format and the requirements document were reviewed by the researchers. The answer options were developed using a library of standard form components, including a dropdown list, multi-select checkboxes and user input validation. Interstitial pages provided guidance to the users on how to answer these questions. A prominent callout label displayed the time period at the top of every screen to remind users to \u2018Answer for the last 4 weeks\u2019 or \u2018Answer for the month of February 2020\u2019.\nPrior to launching, the release candidate of the app (including the questionnaire) was circulated to internal quality assurance testers and nutrition researchers to check that the delivered software matched the requirements document. The sample data collected from the quality assurance sessions were reviewed and checked to be in an analysable format. The questionnaire was launched via controlled roll-out to a smaller cohort of users before wider dissemination. Existing users were invited to complete the questionnaire using a feature flag, which allows the targeting of specific users before roll-out to a wider user base. A total of 199,230 UK users and 19,079 US users declined the diet study invite in the app.\nThe participants were prompted to complete an additional consent form to allow processing of data for purposes outside of COVID-19 research, to allow for further investigations into diet and lifestyle aspects independent of COVID-19. As users submit questionnaires to the application, the data are submitted in JSON format to REST APIs \/ WebServers that store the questionnaire responses in a Postgres Database that is hosted in the Google Cloud Platform operated by ZOE. These data are anonymized and exported daily into comma-separated value files that are delivered via Secure FTP from ZOE to the research partners for further analysis.\nThe LSF-FFQ interface was developed by the engineering team in conjunction with the designer using a four-by-two grid of the eight FFQ \u2018frequency of consumption\u2019 options. Effort was made to retain the original structure and layout of the paper-based validated LSF-FFQ25. The questionnaire was designed for participants to complete the first section in reference to the previous four weeks (peri-pandemic) and then to complete an identical section for the month of February 2020 (pre-pandemic). Additional food items were included in the LSF-FFQ under general consensus by two dietitians and a nutritionist. These food items included fast food; eggs and egg dishes; refined carbohydrates such as white rice, white pasta and white bread; and live probiotic or fermented foods such as kimchi, live yogurt and kefir (Supplementary Information).\nData were collected via two similar app flows in the United Kingdom (over an eight-week period) and via one app flow in the United States (over a nine-week period). In the United Kingdom, the questionnaire was released to 1% of users on 31 July 2020, 2% on 4 August 2020 and 100% on 6 August 2020. In this first app flow, 380,847 participants completed the questionnaire. After reviewing feedback from UK users, the app flow was altered to limit participant burden and to reduce attrition. On 7 August 2020, a new question was added after the participants had completed the first peri-pandemic section asking \u2018Has your diet changed?\u2019 (\u2018Yes\u2019, \u2018No\u2019 or \u2018Unsure\u2019). If users answered \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018unsure\u2019, they were invited to complete the pre-pandemic section. If users answered \u2018No\u2019, the app flow ended (Extended Data Fig.1). A total of 448,321 participants participated in the second flow. In the United States, the questionnaire was launched to 20% of users on 3 September 2020 and 100% on 28 September 2020 (n=\u200967,118 via the second flow only). The mode completion time for both sections was 14\u201316\u2009minutes. Within the app, individuals reported their height and weight in response to the questions \u2018About how much do you weigh without shoes?\u2019 and \u2018About how tall are you without shoes?\u2019. These were converted (if necessary) to kilograms and metres before calculating the BMI (kg\u2009m\u22122). Participant characteristics are described in Supplementary Table1.\nParticipants were excluded if (1) the primary outcome (BMI) was below the 0.1st percentile or above the 99.9th percentile (excluding 10\u2013150\u2009kg\u2009m\u22122), (2) they were pregnant, (3) they were less than 18 years old, or (4) they left questionnaire sections incomplete (the full details are given in Supplementary Table11). Additional exclusions were made per analysis, with the application of percentiles on the consensus of the research team (S.B., R.G., M.M. and E.R.L.). The participants were divided into cohorts relative to the flow of the app (Extended Data Fig.1) and by country: the discovery cohort (n=\u2009380,847) from the first flow, the UK validation cohort (n=\u2009448,321) from the second flow (\u2018Has your diet changed\u2019) and the US replication cohort (n=\u200967,118). A sensitivity analysis was performed to assess significant population differences between the discovery and validation cohorts. We defined \u2018change\u2019 and \u2018no change\u2019 groups within both cohorts relative to a >1-point multi-directional change in DQS (no change, \u22641 and \u2265\u22121). Demographic characteristics were compared between the \u2018change\u2019 and \u2018no change\u2019 groups (Supplementary Table2). The interaction was plotted between the primary outcome (BMI) and the primary exposure (DQS). To minimize bias, all analyses in this study were performed using the discovery cohort. The DI as well as diet and lifestyle pattern analyses were replicated in the UK validation and US replication cohorts.\nA diet and lifestyle DI was developed. The domains sleep (on weekdays), physical activity, diet (DQS and snacking frequency) and alcohol intake frequency were selected on the basis of commonality in previously published healthy lifestyle scores50,51. A bidirectional change was determined as one point for any change (either positive or negative) for each variable, with the maximum disruption score as 5 and the minimum as 0 (Supplementary Table3).\nIn the discovery cohort, and validated in the UK validation cohort, the mean, s.d., and 10th and 90th percentiles for the pre-pandemic and peri-pandemic periods, the percentage change (between the two time points), and the number of participants who increased\/decreased were applied to the continuous and categorical variables (Supplementary Tables4,6and7). For the continuous variables, the quantity of increase\/decrease was also described. Changes in body weight, BMI, DI, physical activity, alcohol intake (units), snacking, fruit and vegetable intake (combined) and diet quality were visualized across UK geographical regions using the Python package geopandas v.0.7.0. IMD was estimated according to small geographical location, or neighbourhood, ranking areas according to multiple deprivation parameters (least deprived\u2009=\u200932,844, most deprived\u2009=\u20091). Further reference to deprivation throughout is related to IMD status24. Deciles for England, Wales and Northern Ireland were pre-generated by the official data source24. For Scotland, the same deciles were applied by the research team.\nFactor analysis with orthogonal transformation (varimax procedure) was used to construct a distinct \u2018healthier\u2019 diet and lifestyle pattern and a \u2018less healthy\u2019 dietary pattern (the loadings and input variables are depicted in Supplementary Table8). The dietary patterns were stratified into quartiles to compare demographic characteristics and body weight changes (Supplementary Tables9and10).\nStructural equation modelling was used to describe the relationship of exposures of changes in sleep (on weekends and weekdays), physical activity, diet (DQS and snacking frequency) and alcohol intake (frequency and quantity) (Supplementary Table5). Age was included in the model owing to its established relationship with BMI32. Changes in body weight were categorized as (1) an absolute bidirectional change, (2) an increase in body weight or (3) a decrease in body weight from pre-pandemic to peri-pandemic weight status. Furthermore, stratified models were also developed on the basis of a low and high IMD. The model was fitted under a maximum likelihood framework using covariance matrices. Relative model fit was assessed using the comparative fit index (0, no fit; 1, perfect fit)52, and the absolute fit by the root mean square error of approximation. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS (IBM Corp), R v.3.5.1 (Foundation for Statistical Computing;https:\/\/www.R-project.org\/) and AMOS53.\nThe King\u2019s College London Ethics Committee approved the ethics for the app, and all users provided consent for non-commercial use. An informal consultation with TwinsUK members over email and social media before the app was launched found that they were overwhelmingly supportive of the project. The US protocol was approved by the Partners Human Research Committee.\nDeidentified participant baseline data collected in the ZOE COVID Study smartphone app can be shared with other health researchers through the NHS-funded Health Data Research UK and Secure Anonymised Information Linkage consortium, housed in the UK Secure Research Platform (Swansea, UK). Anonymized data are available to be shared with researchers according to their protocols in the public interest (https:\/\/web.www.healthdatagateway.org\/dataset\/fddcb382-3051-4394-8436-b92295f14259). Researchers must apply to gain access through Health Data Research UK. The data from the Diet and Lifestyle Questionnaire can be made available by application to TREC at the Department of Twins Research and Epidemiology at King\u2019s College London.

Three different agricultural economic models are used to explore how short- and long-term warming effects of methane can affect the cost-effectiveness of mitigation policies and dietary transitions. Results show that the choice of a particular metric for methane\u2019s warming potential is key to determine optimal mitigation options, with metrics based on shorter-term impacts leading to greater overall emission reduction. Also, the promotion of low-meat diets is more effective at reducing greenhouse gas emissions compared to carbon pricing when mitigation policies are based on metrics that reflect methane\u2019s long-term behaviour. A combination of stringent mitigation measures and dietary changes could achieve substantial emission reduction levels, helping reverse the contribution of agriculture to global warming.\nGovernments around the world have committed to reducing their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to limit the global temperature increase to well below 2\u2009\u00b0C, while pursuing efforts to limit the increase to 1.5\u2009\u00b0C1. The Paris Agreement2establishes the framework to define countries\u2019 commitments through the elaboration of nationally determined contributions (NDCs). The targets of the Paris Agreement require careful consideration of the mitigation role of the agriculture sector. According to the Synthesis report by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change secretariat based on the aggregate effect of the 161 NDCs communicated by 189 Parties3, 74% of the countries that have communicated their NDCs include GHG reduction in the agricultural sector and 80% and 77% of the countries cover methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in their NDCs, respectively. Recent updates indicate that 57% and 62% of countries submitting NDCs cover CH4and N2O emissions, respectively4. Mitigation targets for non-CO2GHG emissions from agriculture are mostly conditional for developed countries. However, agricultural emission reduction policies remain a long way from achieving the substantial reductions that are suggested by modelled scenarios compatible with limiting warming to 1.5\u20132\u2009\u00b0C5. In addition, there are ongoing discussions around the role of short-lived GHGs such as CH4, and associated metrics, with particularly relevant implications for agriculture emission reduction policies and how the contribution of the sector to climate change mitigation is perceived.\nGHG emission metrics pursue the goal of comparing the global warming contributions of different climate gases in a transparent and understandable way, without compromising climate scientific knowledge. National GHG inventories, which follow common methodological guidance provided by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)6,7are used to report GHG emissions and removals towards national binding commitments (that is, Kyoto Protocol quantified emission limitation and reduction objectives and Paris Agreement NDCs), and therefore also as accounting tools to check compliance against such commitments.\nNon-CO2GHG emissions are commonly reported as \u2018CO2-equivalents\u2019 (CO2e) and calculated using the 100\u2009yr global warming potential (GWP100)6,7,8NDCs in which nations set out their emission reduction targets, and economic costing tools valuing different emissions (or mitigations thereof) are largely built on this approach. As a metric that provides a single per-emission weighting of each gas, the GWP100fails to capture how the relative impacts of different gases change over time. Due to its short atmospheric lifetime, the impacts of CH4emissions rapidly decline after a few decades. Meanwhile, due to its long lifetime, each CO2emission exerts a relatively stable impact on global temperature into the long term. The relative valuation of CH4to CO2is thus highly sensitive to the metric used, particularly the metric\u2019s time horizon9,10,11.\nProposals to account for this effect include adding supplementary information to NDCs about the emissions levels and\/or separate targets for individual GHGs (for example, New Zealand has a separate target to reduce biogenic CH4emissions), and\/or reporting aggregated emissions using different metrics, such as shifting among conventional GWPs with different time horizons, for example, GWP20 (ref.12), or using alternative metric approaches, for example, GWP* (refs.13,14). While this debate on the usefulness of alternative metrics is still ongoing in the scientific literature, the fact that CH4, as a short-lived gas, has distinct impacts whether viewed over the shorter or longer term is well established.\nAs CH4is responsible for a large proportion of global GHG emissions, changes to the valuation of CH4relative to CO2can strongly affect how much the agricultural sector is forced by policy decision-makers to reduce its GHG emissions and responds to \u2018carbon pricing\u2019. In addition, the contrasting lifetimes of the two gases result in distinct warming dynamics, which should be kept in mind when considering the nature of agriculture\u2019s contribution to global warming. Therefore, these considerations could have substantial implications for how agroeconomic policies are designed and evaluated as well as what policy recommendations are put forward. In this article we explore the impacts of acknowledging the distinct differences between short-lived and long-lived climate gases in mitigation frameworks.\nAn ensemble of large-scale economic land-use models was used to quantify the cost-effective contribution of agriculture to mitigating climate change under different valuations of CH4based on a similar set of counterfactual scenarios as in ref.15). The three economic models (CAPRI, GLOBIOM and MAGNET) provide detailed representations of the agricultural sector, cross-sectoral linkages through factor markets and substitution effects and GHG emissions by agricultural production activity. Our focus was on the reduction of agricultural emissions over time and their effective contribution to climate change, differentiating between sources (for example, ruminant, dairy and rice production) and world producing regions16.\nWe analysed how mitigation policies (focusing either on the short- or long-term effects) affect emission reductions and the consequences for the agricultural sector by way of two mitigation options. First, a global carbon price path on the supply side, inducing both the implementation of technical mitigation options to reduce emission intensity and affecting production (structural changes and production levels) as described in ref.15. Second, a change towards lower consumption of animal-protein-based diets on the demand side (see Table1for an overview of the scenarios analysed). \u2018Carbon pricing\u2019 is widely considered an efficient means to achieve the ambitions set out in the Paris Agreement17,18,19,20. Monitoring of CH4emissions from agriculture is not an easy task due to their biological nature, diverse land-use techniques and widely different farm management practices21,22,23, and therefore direct emission taxation may be problematic. Independent of the practical challenges, carbon pricing has been applied in agricultural economic models as a means to identify the cost-effective potential, or as an approximation of other mitigation policies15,24Moreover, the economic models applied considered a global mitigation cost curve as the estimate of the aggregated mitigation potential and costs of specific mitigation technologies25,26.\nIn this study we explored alternative CH4valuations based on the discussions that have arisen over implications of the short-lived character of CH4by means of scenarios combining two different carbon prices (US$150 and US$500\u2009t\u22121) on non-CO2agricultural emissions and a low-animal-protein diet (Table1). Conventionally, the impact of CH4is made comparable to CO2via the GWP100, describing the integral of the induced radiative forcing over time (100\u2009yr) compared to that of CO2. By using the integral, both short-term strong warming and its fast decay are included. However, when the ambition is to reduce warming in the next few decades, a shorter time horizon might be applied in comparing the effects of CO2and CH4. Moreover, if one wants to stress that CH4only has little effect on warming in the long term, a longer perspective or end-point temperature might be appropriate. The GWP* method13,14stresses that the short-term effect of CH4is four times higher than in the conventional GWP100method, but is only 0.25 of the conventional GWP100(3.75 of the initial 4 is reversed) in the long term (equation (1)). To reflect \u2018short-term\u2019, \u2018conventional\u2019 or \u2018long-term\u2019 perspectives, we applied all three in the pricing schemes. With the GWP100of CH4being 25, this resulted in methane equivalence factors (MEFs) of 100, 25 and 6.25, respectively. The short- and long-term factors, 100 and 6.25, are in fact close to the 20\u2009yr global warming potential (GWP20), 84, and to the 100-year global temperature change potential (GTP100), 4 (IPCC 5th Assessment Report (AR5)), and these two metrics, GWP20and GTP100, have also been recommended as alternative metrics for life-cycle assessment to consider the shorter and longer term27.\nTo analyse effective mitigation by the agricultural sector in these scenarios, we reported both emissions and added warming. Added warming from CO2was assessed by applying the so-called transient climate response to cumulated carbon emissions (TCRE)28. This measure can be applied across all GHGs when using appropriate CO2-equivalence emissions. GWP* was designed so that cumulative GHG emissions are correlated with added warming13, similar to what GWP100does for CO2, N2O and other long-lived gases, but not for short-lived gases such as CH4(refs.13,14) (Methods).\nIn addition to mitigation efforts targeting the supply side, reduced consumption of animal-protein-based diets has also been identified as a promising strategy to curb GHG emissions from the agriculture and global food systems29,30,31. Following ref.15, we assumed a threshold on animal product calories of 430\u2009kcal per capita per day (ruminant, non-ruminant and dairy production). This target excluded food waste and is assumed to be achieved by 2070, such that calorie consumption decreased linearly from current levels. No increase in consumption of vegetable calories was assumed, but it might occur endogenously. Model results showed a decrease in average global calorie consumption by at most 3.8% in 2070. This difference could be replaced by a larger consumption of legumes, increasing global agricultural area by up to 1.5% in 2070 compared with the baseline in that year, or simply left unchanged as a measure to reduce overweight and obesity.\nTable1shows the mitigation and dietary shift scenarios analysed by the three economic models.\nOur business-as-usual scenario (BASE) with no GHG mitigation policy corresponds to the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 2 (SSP2), a \u2018middle-of-the-road\u2019 scenario which depicts a future of global development where developing countries achieve important economic growth32,33. With these assumptions, global agricultural CH4emissions are expected to increase by over 50% between 2010 and 2070, reaching 170\u2013240\u2009Mt\u2009yr\u22121in 2070, depending on the model. This increase comes at a decreasing rate (Fig.1), reflecting a certain convergence of red meat and dairy consumption worldwide. In fact, while developed economies show a stable trend, developing countries continue increasing their intake of animal protein from very low levels. Most of the increase in CH4emissions is to be attributed to higher productivity per animal in ruminant production, with cattle numbers slightly increasing (beef herds) or even decreasing (dairy herds).\nRegional totals for scenarios by baseline year and model (Mt\u2009CH4).

By 2010, about 57% of total agricultural CH4emissions were coming from India, China, Brazil, sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia. By 2050 and 2070, these regions are expected to increase their share to about 62%. In CAPRI and MAGNET, sub-Saharan Africa and India are expected to remain as the largest CH4emitters, with about 40\u201350% of total CH4emissions in all models. China, in turn, is characterized by stable or slightly decreasing emissions, depending on the model projection. GLOBIOM, in turn, projects a larger emission share for China for 2050 and 2070.\nWe present induced warming from both gases (as described above) relative to 2010. Under the baseline, increasing CH4emissions alone induce a warming of about 0.1\u2009\u00b0C, and about 0.175\u2009\u00b0C together with N2O (grey shaded areas in Fig.2c,d).\na\u2013d, World totals by year and model: annual Mt\u2009CH4(a); annual Mt\u2009N2O (b); added warming for CH4emissions (c); and added warming for total non-CO2emissions (d). The shading is the range (distribution across models for respective scenario) compared to the average (thick middle line).\nSource data\nThe implementation of a carbon price of US$150\u2009t\u22121(CP150) to the agricultural sector based on GWP100yields an average reduction of 12%, 28% and 40% in CH4emissions in 2030, 2050 and 2070, respectively, compared to the baseline in those same years (Fig.2a). Similarly, the average impact CP500 constitutes a reduction of 23%, 40% and 53% in CH4emissions for the three projections, respectively (Supplementary Fig.2a). The impact of these CH4emissions for additional global warming is positive for CP150 (that is, causes warming relative to 2010; Fig.2c), but turns negative for CP500 in 2070 (that is, causes cooling relative to 2010; Supplementary Fig.2). High carbon pricing thus leads to a substantial reduction in CH4emissions, partially reversing some of the warming CH4emissions previously caused, as CH4concentrations (and subsequently their contribution to warming) will fall if emission rates sufficiently decline. Despite that contribution, the warming effect of total non-CO2emissions from agriculture remains positive (+0.05\u2009\u00b0C; Fig.2d).\nWe further investigate the effects of a carbon price scheme that focuses on either the short-term or long-term temperature impact of CH4emissions as explained above. For this, we model carbon pricing based on the short-term effects (CP150_ST and CP500_ST) and on the long-term effects (CP150_LT and CP500_LT) derived from the original carbon price scenarios. A carbon price scheme focusing on the short-term temperature effect of CH4considerably reduces CH4emissions (Fig.2a) and turns the implied warming effect of this declining emission path negative (Fig.2c). CP150_ST yields CH4emission reductions of about 41% and CP500-ST 60% in 2070. However, emission reductions are considerably less than proportional to the carbon price increase. In fact, at high carbon price levels technological options for mitigation are exhausted and agricultural systems become very constrained, facing severe income losses (Table2). The results for CP500_ST and CP500-LT can be found in theSupplementary Information. Figure2bshows the indirect impact of the GWP100-based carbon price scheme on N2O emissions and Fig.2dthe aggregated impact on added temperature for both CH4and N2O.\nThe difference in model responses to the carbon pricing schemes comes from the different response of producers and consumers to the increased carbon pricing scheme which results from applying the different metrics. For instance, compared to CAPRI and GLOBIOM, the MAGNET model assumes that consumers are more willing to pay the higher prices for meat that result from the increased carbon prices (and thus are willing to spend a larger fraction of their total income on food). Moreover, in MAGNET part of the sales of the meat sector are going to non-food sectors such as the chemical sector (for example, fats) which can easily pay the increased price. Furthermore, the mitigation options available to the sector are limited after the initial reductions compared to the baseline due to a steeper marginal abatement cost curve for initial carbon prices in MAGNET. The willingness of all consumers to pay more for ruminants is also reflected in the higher producer prices for ruminants in Supplementary Fig.5.\nWhile the simulated dietary shifts lead to further emission reduction on top of carbon pricing, dietary shifts alone have a lower impact than carbon pricing on emission reduction\u2014at least for the given assumptions (Fig.3c). When dietary shifts are combined with carbon pricing, induced warming from CH4compared to 2010 turns negative for both carbon prices.\na\u2013d, World totals by year and model: annual Mt\u2009CH4(a); annual Mt N2O (b); added warming for CH4emissions (c); and added warming for total non-CO2emissions (d). The shading is the range (distribution across models for respective scenario) compared to the average (thick middle line).\nSource data\nAdding dietary shifts to carbon pricing that focuses on either the short-term or the long-term effect of CH4emissions does not change the main results compared to a situation without dietary shifts. However, the magnitude of the impact is different. The additional impact of dietary shifts on reducing induced warming becomes larger (smaller) if the carbon price is based on the long-term (short-term) effect of CH4emissions. Moreover, that effect decreases with the carbon price level consistently across all scenarios: the larger the reduction in warming due to carbon pricing, the less effect dietary shifts will have. This is because higher carbon prices lead to more technical emission reduction measures, reducing the emission intensity of foods and hence reducing the magnitude of the effects of dietary shifts. When mitigation efforts are based on the long-term effects of CH4, carbon pricing becomes a less powerful mitigation tool relative to dietary shifts. The opposite holds when carbon pricing focuses on the short-term effect of CH4. In this case, CH4is priced stronger and the additional effect of dietary shifts decreases (Table2). In all scenarios, in absolute terms, carbon pricing remains more important for mitigation than a dietary shift.\nCarbon pricing and dietary changes lead to a contraction of agricultural production (Table2). Dietary shifts have a larger impact on production than carbon pricing. In the absence of carbon pricing, a dietary shift leads to a 13% reduction in 2070 compared to the baseline. Adding a carbon price has minor additional impact. When dietary changes are considered, production drops between 15% and 18% depending on the carbon pricing regime and the carbon price level. However, if no dietary shifts are considered, production only decreases between 2% and 8% depending on the carbon price regime and level. The reason for this result is twofold. First, carbon pricing allows, and incentivizes, farmers to implement mitigation options without necessarily reducing production. Second, farmers can pass some of the costs on to consumers to better maintain profitability in production. Table2indicates that the prices farmers receive at the farm gate increase in the presence of carbon pricing. In the case of a dietary shift, demand simply decreases and producer prices fall. In fact, in the absence of carbon pricing, producer prices fall by 16%. They still decrease up to 11% in the long term with the lower carbon tax (CP150_LT_D), but the pure price effect from the dietary shifts is mitigated by the carbon tax. Carbon taxes drive up the production costs, which is translated into higher producer prices. This effect is visible in CP500_ST_D, where the carbon tax is highest and price impacts vary from a 2% decline (MEF-LT) to a 26% increase (MEF-ST).\nThe carbon pricing regime seems to have a limited effect on overall agricultural production, but a stronger effect on producer prices. Carbon pricing regimes that focus either on the short-term or the long-term warming impact of CH4emissions result in a 1 percentage point deviation of production compared to carbon pricing using the conventional GWP100. Overall production decreases 4% under a carbon pricing regime based on the short-term warming impact of CH4, while the reduction is 2\u20133% under a GWP100pricing regime with a carbon price of US$150\u2009t\u22121. A decomposition of the production effects reveals that carbon pricing leads to a decline in both crop, non-ruminant and ruminant production under all carbon pricing regimes and for all carbon price levels. As a major source of CH4emissions, ruminant production experiences the largest decrease of the three types of production. At the same time, it is heavily affected by the choice of the carbon pricing scheme. About 40% of the decrease in ruminant production is avoided if a carbon pricing regime based on the long-term warming impact of CH4is employed rather than conventional GWP100with a carbon price of US$150\u2009t\u22121. The carbon pricing regime plays a much smaller role if a dietary shift causes the reduction in ruminant production. In this case, only one-tenth of the drop in ruminant production is reversed.\nProducer prices show larger impacts, in particular when the carbon pricing regime focuses on the short-term warming impact of CH4. For a carbon price of US$500\u2009t\u22121, prices increase by 24% under conventional CP500, but 51% under CP500-ST (Table2). Moreover, the uncertainty expressed through variation in results across models around those price changes is larger for higher carbon prices and short-term focus (Supplementary Fig.4).\nSince the change in diets is also partially taking place through changes in the composition of food supply and reduction in production volumes, we finally compare in Fig.4the impact on livestock calorie consumption of carbon pricing with and without dietary shifts. While global livestock per-capita calorie consumption is reduced in the dietary shift scenarios by about 4\u201318% in 2030, 13\u201331% in 2050 and 23\u201336% in 2070, depending on the model, the reduction is much lower when only considering carbon pricing (around 9% achieved by the CP500_ST scenario). This calorie reduction takes place only in emerging economies with high meat consumption (for example, China, former Soviet Union, Brazil) and developed countries (European Union, United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand).\na,bRegional totals for scenarios including a dietary shift (a) and scenarios with no dietary shift (b).

We show how different valuations of CH4relative to CO2impact the choice of mitigation policies in agriculture and, consequently, affect the sector\u2019s contribution to further global warming.\nWhile a number of earlier studies, such as Smith et al.34, Reisinger et al.35, van den Berg et al.36and Strefler et al.37, have explored the implications of different CH4valuations on emission abatement, only Reisinger et al.35includes a specific breakdown of agricultural impacts. In this paper, we go further, using a multimodel comparison of updated agricultural economic models, including the independent impacts of dietary shifts (that is, shifts to low-animal-protein diets), and reporting the global warming contribution of our agricultural emission scenarios.\nOur research underlines the fact that emission accounting metrics have an impact on climate mitigation policy options. This question deserves further analysis within the IPCC AR6 process and will certainly become more prominent as the share of agricultural emissions post-2030 will increase as widespread decarbonisation will rapidly start reducing emissions from other sectors that currently dominate. Conventionally, the impact of a certain sector on climate is evaluated though its annual GHG emissions, typically aggregated and reported in GWP100. However, due to the short-lived character of CH4, (cumulative) GWP100CO2e emissions do not necessarily correctly reflect implied warming, especially not under stringent mitigation scenarios. We therefore present here explicitly the warming induced by agricultural CH4and N2O emissions.\nDecreasing CH4emissions from agriculture can have a negative warming effect, as revealed when using the GWP* metric (Fig.2c). In this respect, decreasing CH4emission rates have, in terms of overall climate impact relative to current temperatures, the same effect as CO2uptake or carbon capture and storage technologies. This may allow for some leeway in the design of climate policy packages and consideration of whether some emissions may ultimately be considered compatible with climate targets. However, this effect is scenario dependent and does not necessarily apply to agriculture overall when considering all GHGs. Our analysis shows that total agricultural emissions will contribute to further global warming irrespective of the carbon pricing regime and carbon price level. Compared to Frank et al.15, the global warming impact remains unchanged until 2050 and starts decreasing while getting close to 2070, mainly due to a regional convergence of world animal protein consumption and technology adoption induced by carbon pricing. These results are linked to agricultural emission pathways based on medium- and long-term projections of agricultural markets.\nConsistent with earlier studies on the contribution of agriculture to stringent climate mitigation efforts15,38we find that comparable carbon pricing would reduce agricultural CH4and N2O emissions by up to 58% and 53%, respectively, compared to the baseline in 2070 and reduce aggregate warming above 2010 levels to zero in 2070 (from 0.17\u2009\u00b0C in the baseline). Focusing specifically on the short-term effect of CH4will lead to even larger reductions in CH4emissions, but will come with more severe impacts in the agricultural system in terms of prices and production indices. The impact of low-animal-protein diets as a mitigation option strongly depends on the context in which this trend is occurring. Reductions in meat consumption and production will considerably contribute to climate stabilization and become a powerful mitigation technology if carbon pricing is moderate (Fig.3c,d).\nEmission mitigation policies could have an ambiguous effect on livestock production if society gives more value to the long-term effect of CH4. On the one hand, carbon pricing based on the long-term warming impact of CH4relieves pressure to reduce cattle herds. On the other, that pricing regime also highlights the large immediate benefits of reducing CH4, and dietary change has a greater effect in this case, where lower carbon pricing has resulted in fewer technical measures to reduce CH4emissions. Moreover, while carbon pricing leaves farmers with the option to implement less-emitting technologies, a dietary shift simply means fewer cows.\nOur results highlight\u2014beyond the sheer emission and warming effects\u2014the differential impact of various carbon pricing levels and dietary shifts on the agricultural sector. Carbon pricing has in general the largest effect on emissions, but with increasing carbon price levels, the negative economic impacts on the agricultural sector in terms of lower production continue to increase, while further emission reductions are relatively small. This reflects a situation where the technical abatement options are fully applied and further reduction comes from price-induced reduction in consumption38. Consequently, incentives for agricultural mitigation should exploit all technical abatement options that are feasible but also carefully address regionally specific consumption effects.\nIn this context, we note that although multigas mitigation policies are expected to prove more cost effective than CO2-only approaches39, the distribution of costs across different sectors can be uneven, with, for example, higher CH4valuations increasing costs for agriculture and predominantly benefiting the energy sector35. Therefore, while this study focused on agriculture alone, it would be useful for further work to explore interactions with other sectors, and policy formulation should be mindful of distributional issues that may arise from different emission pricing options.\nOur results come with some limitations. First, we apply a comparative-static modelling framework to a dynamic decision problem. Second, our model exercise disregards the costs of monitoring emissions and inducing dietary shifts. Refraining from these transaction costs, our analysis potentially overestimates the efficiency of the investigated mitigation options. More research is needed to develop and analyse how a switch to metrics (or simply modelling approaches that do not require metrics) that better reflect the warming potential of different climate pollutants can be implemented in practice and whether transaction costs will reduce the efficiency of these mitigation options.\nThe CAPRI (Common Agricultural Policy Regionalised Impact) modelling system is an economic large-scale, comparative-static, partial equilibrium model focusing on agriculture and the primary processing sectors. CAPRI comprises two interacting modules, linking a set of mathematical programming models of EU regional agricultural supply to a spatial multicommodity model for global agrifood markets. The regional supply models depict a profit-maximizing behaviour of representative farms in the European Union and candidate countries, taking into account constraints related to land availability, nutrient balances for cropping and animal activities and policy restrictions40. The market module consists of a spatial, non-stochastic global multicommodity model for about 60 primary and processed agricultural products, covering 77 countries in 40 trading blocks. Bilateral trade flows and attached prices are modelled based on the Armington assumption of quality differentiation41. The behavioural functions in the market model represent supply and demand for primary agricultural and processed commodities (including human and feed consumption, biofuel use, import demand from multilateral trade relations), balancing constraints and agricultural market policy instruments (that is, import tariffs, tariff rate quotas, producer and consumer support estimates, and so on). Depending on scenarios, behavioural functions are shifted (for example, to reflect productivity shocks or preference shifts) and the model solves for the new market equilibrium.\nWith regard to GHG accounting, CAPRI calculates EU agricultural GHG emissions for the most important N2O and CH4emission sources based on the inputs and outputs of agricultural production activities, following to a large extent the 2006 IPCC guidelines. It also takes into account detailed technical and management-based GHG mitigation options for EU agriculture. GHG emissions for the rest of the world are estimated on a commodity basis in the market model42,43GHG mitigation in non-European countries is represented by a change in emission factors and a matching change in output prices to reflect the increase in cost, derived from mitigation cost functions from the literature25. In terms of the database the European data are mostly sourced from Eurostat, while the international data are mostly from the Food and Agriculture Organization, for both model parts supplemented by topic-related sources.\nThe Global Biosphere Management Model (GLOBIOM)44is a partial equilibrium model that covers the global agricultural and forestry sectors, including the bioenergy sector. Commodity markets and international trade are represented at the level of 35 economic regions in this study. Prices are endogenously determined at the regional level to establish market equilibrium to reconcile demand, domestic supply and international trade. The spatial resolution of the supply side relies on the concept of simulation units, which are aggregates of 5\u201330\u2009arcmin pixels belonging to the same altitude, slope and soil class, and the same country45. For crops, livestock and forest products, spatially explicit Leontief production functions covering alternative production systems are parameterized using biophysical models such as EPIC (Environmental Policy Integrated Model)46, G4M (Global Forest Model)47or the RUMINANT model48. For the present study, the supply-side spatial resolution was aggregated to 2\u00b0 (about 200\u2009\u00d7\u2009200\u2009km at the equator). Land and other resources are allocated to the different production and processing activities to maximize a social welfare function which consists of the sum of producer and consumer surplus. The model includes six landcover types: cropland, grassland, short rotation plantations, managed forests, unmanaged forests and other natural vegetation land. Depending on the relative profitability of the production activities of primary products, by-products and final products, the model can switch from one landcover type to another. Spatially explicit land conversion over the simulation period is endogenously determined within the available land resources and conversion costs that are taken into account in the producer optimization behaviour. Land conversion possibilities are further restricted through biophysical land suitability and production potentials, and through a matrix of potential landcover transitions. GLOBIOM covers major GHG emissions from agricultural production, forestry and other land use including CO2emissions from above- and belowground biomass changes, N2O from the application of synthetic fertilizer and manure to soils, N2O from manure dropped on pastures, CH4from rice cultivation, N2O and CH4from manure management, and CH4from enteric fermentation. For this study, only results for non-CO2emissions were reported.\nGLOBIOM explicitly covers different mitigation options for the agricultural sector. Technical mitigation options such as anaerobic digesters, livestock feed supplements, nitrogen inhibitors, and so on, are based on ref.49. Structural adjustments are represented through a comprehensive set of crop and livestock management systems parameterized using biophysical models, that is, transition in management systems, reallocation of production within and across regions44and consumers\u2019 response to market signals50. Detailed information on the parameterization of the different mitigation options for the agricultural sector is presented in ref.38. For more information on the general model structure we refer to refs.44,51.\nThe Modular Applied GeNeral Equilibrium Tool (MAGNET) model is a multiregional, multisectoral, applied general equilibrium model based on neoclassical microeconomic theory52,53. It is an extended version of the standard GTAP model54. The core of MAGNET is an input\u2013output model, which links industries in value-added chains from primary goods, over continuously higher stages of intermediate processing, to the final assembly of goods and services for consumption. Primary production factors are employed within each economic region, and hence returns to land and capital are endogenously determined at equilibrium, that is, the aggregate supply of each factor equals its demand. On the consumption side, the regional household is assumed to distribute income across savings and (government and private) consumption expenditures according to fixed budget shares. Private consumption expenditures are allocated across commodities according to a non-homothetic constant difference of elasticity expenditure function, and government consumption according to Cobb\u2013the Douglas expenditure function.\nThe MAGNET model, in comparison to GTAP, uses a more general multilevel sector-specific nested constant elasticity of substitution production function, allowing for substitution between primary production factors (land, labour, capital and natural resources) and intermediate production factors, and for substitution between different intermediate input components (for example, energy sources and animal feed components). MAGNET includes an improved treatment of agricultural sectors, examples include: various imperfectly substitutable types of land; the land-use allocation structure; a land-supply function; substitution between various animal-feed components53,55, agricultural policy (such as production quotas and different land-related payments) and biofuel policy (capital-energy substitution, fossil fuel\u2013biofuel substitution56). On the consumption side, a dynamic constant difference of elasticity expenditure function is implemented which allows for changes in income elasticities when purchasing-power-parity-corrected real gross domestic product per capita changes. Segmentation and imperfect mobility between agriculture and non-agriculture labour and capital are introduced in the modelling of factors markets.\nMAGNET calculates absolute non-CO2GHG emissions resulting from agricultural production which depends on demand (gross domestic product, population, diet and bioenergy use) and productivity. Emission intensities (that is, emissions per unit of production) are determined through model-specific emission factors. In addition, emission intensities change in the SSP2 baseline scenario due to the following assumptions on technological improvements: (1) nitrogen fertilizer substitution with labour, capital and land; (2) yield increases due to exogenous technological improvements (adopted from IMAGE) and endogenous improvements due to substitution of land with fertilizer and land\u2013fertilizer bundle with labour and capital; and (3) exogenous feed use efficiency by livestock (adopted from the IMAGE model57) and endogenous substitution between different feed components.\nIn MAGNET most of the CH4emissions scale with the output of the agricultural sector and so taxing the emissions is equivalent to a tax on output. This is also the case with N2O emissions from the livestock sectors. For the crop sectors, however, N2O emissions come mostly from the application of synthetic fertilizer which can be substituted for land. If the land price rises (declines) the crop sectors will have an increased incentive to apply more (less) fertilizer and use relatively less (more) land. Marginal abatement cost curves are exogenously implemented based on calculations per sector and region from the IMAGE model. For every period the CO2price would correspond to a particular level of emission abatement by technical means (that is, farmers would have an incentive to invest in abatement technology) which would be reflected in a reduction of the emission coefficient for a particular agricultural sector. The additional cost of this abatement would be added to the effective carbon price applied to the sector.\nThe scenarios considered are counterfactual to a long-term \u2018business as usual\u2019 projection of agricultural commodity markets and are presented to provide a more comprehensive perspective of how global mitigation policies and dietary policies could contribute to the temperature target set by the Paris Agreement under GWP100and GWP* metrics. Focus is on the reduction of agricultural CH4emissions over time and their effective contribution to climate change, differentiating between sources (for example, ruminant, dairy and rice production) and world producing regions.\nTo analyse the economic impact of global climate mitigation policies we use a global carbon price path as a proxy for a global mitigation effort15. The impacts of this global carbon price on CH4emissions depends on the emission metric applied, and will differ from the standard GWP100if the GWP* metric is applied due to the introduction of time dynamics in its calculation. This is achieved through the following equation, presented as in the simplified rearrangement from ref.11:\nwhere \u2018CO2-warming-equivalent\u2019 emissions (\\(E_{{\\mathrm{CO}_{2} \\mbox{-} {\\mathrm{w.eq.}}}}\\)) have a large initial effect at the time of release (four times the conventional GWP100valuation), but much of this (3.75 times the conventional GWP100valuation) is considered reversed 20\u2009yr later. Consequently, the reported CO2e valuation of CH4emissions can be higher for those sources where emissions have increased over time and can be negative for those cases where emissions have decreased.\nAdded temperature from CH4emissions is computed in equation (2):\nwhere\\({\\mathrm{AW}}_{{\\mathrm{CH}_{4}}\\left( t \\right)}\\)is the added warming (that is, temperature increase or decrease) in yeartrelative to yeart\u2212\u200920. For TCRE (that is, the transient climate response to cumulated carbon emissions)28, we use the observationally constrained best estimate of 1.8\u2009\u00b0C per TtC13, which is converts into 0.49\u2009\u00b0C per TtCO2.\n\u2018Carbon pricing\u2019 is widely acknowledged as an efficient means to achieve the ambitions set out in the Paris Agreement17,18,19,20; however, it requires a transparent, predictable and practicable monitoring system that reports emissions at their source. Emissions from agriculture differ from emissions from standardized industrial processes due to their biological nature, diverse land-use techniques and different farm-management practices, leading to large variations in emission intensities for identical products21,22,23. In addition, the spatial dispersion of farming renders the accurate monitoring of agricultural emissions at their source almost impossible. Carbon prices have therefore been applied in agricultural economic models as an approximation of other policies that incentivize farmers to implement mitigation options (or penalizes them for not adopting them), while the transaction costs caused by those policies have been neglected15,24.\nNotwithstanding the fact that monitoring emissions in agriculture involves high transaction costs, the change in the GHG accounting metric to GWP* makes the implementation of a carbon price in agriculture more complicated because the warming impact of CH4emissions needs to be based on two points in time, 20\u2009yr apart. In effect, the full impact of emissions is delayed by 20\u2009yr, raising concerns about who can be made responsible for paying the carbon price. GWP100accounts for emissions only in the year in which they originate. On the contrary, GWP* accounting requires the year emissions occur, and 20\u2009yr before, to reflect that short-lived CH4is rapidly destroyed in the atmosphere via natural processes. A carbon price that requires a time span of 20\u2009yr to be calculated is difficult to administer. Neither the farmer nor the firm responsible for the emissions will necessarily be the same after 20\u2009yr. (This 20-yr time span is suggested in ref.13, which has the effect of reducing the volatility in CO2-w.eq. emissions and improving the correspondence with temperature response.)\nFor this paper, we consider two options for the computation of the carbon price: a \u2018short term\u2019 (MEF-ST) and a \u2018long term\u2019 (MEF-LT) one, separating out the two components of the GWP* equation.\nThe MEF-ST option focuses on the strong impact of changing CH4emission rates, computing the carbon price based on the initial valuation at the point an emission occurs, and neglecting the subsequent reversal of most of the emission\u2019s impact in the years ahead. Consequently, the resulting carbon price will be four times higher than a GWP100-based carbon price, leading to strong incentives to mitigate CH4emissions. The MEF-ST option could reflect motives of decision-makers that prioritize reducing overall GHG emissions fast, that is, almost independent from any metric.\nThe MEF-LT option aims at implementing a GWP*-based carbon price assuming that the CH4dynamics are perfectly understood by economic actors and credibly enforced by regulators. Since we apply static models to a dynamic planning problem, we simplify the planning problem by assuming Hotelling\u2019s rule58. This rule states that the optimal price path of a non-renewable, durable resource follows the discount rate. We assume that every CO2emission causes the same damage, and, consequently, no tipping points are considered. In our case, that resource would be the CO2-absorbing capacity of the atmosphere. With constant carbon prices in real terms, the carbon price will be understood as a regime that charges emissions four times the GWP100-based carbon price the year they accrue, but rewards a rebate of 3.75 times that price 20\u2009yr later. The net effect is a price of (4\u2009\u2013\u20093.75\u2009=) 25% of the GWP100-based carbon price. The MEF-LT option thus reflects the fact that \u2018after 20 years much of the warming caused by an individual CH4emitter is automatically reserved\u201911. In our models, the MEF-LT carbon price is implemented with its net effect in the year emissions occur.\nThe two options above only regard the pricing of CH4. The computation of the carbon price for CO2and N2O is not affected by GWP* and follows GWP100in both options. Although N2O is less durable than CO2, it is not considered a short-lived climate gas like CH4. These globally uniform carbon prices are used to estimate the cost-efficient mitigation potential and its distribution across sectors and regions rather than a real-world policy15. We apply two global carbon price trajectories, US$150 and US$500 per tCO2e at 2070, consistent with earlier publications, as higher carbon prices cannot stimulate more technical options, but decrease consumption. In addition to CH4emissions, N2O emissions from agricultural production are priced according to the GWP100N2O price. In line with the focus of this study on non-CO2emissions from agriculture, CO2emissions from deforestation or other land-use change are not priced.\nThe second mitigation option is a shift towards consumption of diet containing less animal protein. The adoption of such a diet has been identified in the literature as a promising strategy to curb GHG emissions from the agriculture and global food systems29,30. This is in line with recommendations by the EAT-Lancet Commission, which proposes a healthier diet where whole grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts and legumes comprise a greater proportion of foods consumed. This diet includes calorie intake targets by food group and a total calorie intake target of 2,100\u2009kcal (refs.31,59,60,61,62,63).\nThe models are run for two options for the computation of the carbon price: MEF-ST (\u2018short-term\u2019) and MEF-LT (\u2018long-term\u2019). Both options use the same carbon price. We distinguish two price paths: US$150 and US$500 per tCO2e in 2005. Following Hotelling\u2019s rule58, the optimal carbon price path follows a discount rate which is set to 5%. This results in the carbon price rates shown in Table3.\nWe base our computation of the carbon price for CH4on the GWP* equation in ref.11, p. 3:\nwhere\\({\\mathrm{GWP}}^*_t\\)measures the global warming potential of CH4depending on emitted CH4in yeartand emitted CH420\u2009yr before (t-\u200920). Emitted CH4intappears a second time in the calculation of GWP* int+\u200920:\nAssuming a carbon price rate CPRt, a given CH4emissionESLCP(t)in yeartis taxed twice and the total amount CPtof that emission is given by:\nSince the path of the carbon price follows the discount rate, the carbon price rate in real prices remains the same in all years, CPt+20=\u2009CPt.\nThe MEF-ST option of the carbon price disregards the flow term, that is, the price reward 20\u2009yr after the emission occurred. Therefore, the carbon price of a CH4emission in yeartdefined in US$ per tCH4becomes:\nThe long-term option of the carbon price regards both terms, and the carbon price of a CH4emission in yeartdefined as US$ per tCH4is computed as:\nAssuming GWP100=\u200925 (AR4), the carbon prices for the two options are shown in Table4. For comparison, the price rates based on GWP100are also shown.\nFurther information on research design is available in theNature Research Reporting Summarylinked to this article.\nThe data that support the findings of this study are available under the data portal of agro-economics modelling of the European Commission (https:\/\/datam.jrc.ec.europa.eu, climate change section).Source dataare provided with this paper.\nAll programming codes are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.\nSchleussner, C.-F. et al.

Here we assess the performance of two widely used \u2018top-down\u2019 gridded frameworks (Global Agro-ecological Zones and Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project) versus an alternative \u2018bottom-up\u2019 approach (Global Yield Gap Atlas). The Global Yield Gap Atlas estimates extra production potential locally for a number of sites representing major breadbaskets and then upscales the results to larger spatial scales. We find that estimates from top-down frameworks are alarmingly unlikely, with estimated potential production being lower than current farm production at some locations. The consequences of using these coarse estimates to predict food security are illustrated by an example for sub-Saharan Africa, where using different approaches would lead to different prognoses about future cereal self-sufficiency. Our study shows that foresight about food security and associated agriculture research priority setting based on yield potential and yield gaps derived from top-down approaches are subject to a high degree of uncertainty and would benefit from incorporating estimates from bottom-up approaches.\nMeeting food demand on existing cropland, without further encroachment of natural ecosystems such as forests, wetlands and savannahs, is one of the greatest challenges of our time1. Orienting investments on agricultural research and development (AR&D) to meet that challenge requires information about where the largest opportunities to increase crop yields exist within the current cultivated area2,3,4,5. The yield gap, defined as the difference between actual farm yield and the yield potential with good management that minimizes yield losses from biotic and abiotic stresses, is a key biophysical indicator of the available room for crop production increase with current land and water resources6. Global assessments of future food security and land-use change published in high-profile journals have followed a \u2018top-down\u2019 approach that relies on crudely calibrated crop models and a gridded spatial framework to organize coarse data on climate, soil, and cropping systems to estimate yield potential and associated yield gaps7,8,9,10(Fig.1and Supplementary Table1). Recent assessments for specific countries suggest, however, that top-down approaches provide estimates of yield potential and yield gaps that are not useful for effective prioritization of AR&D investments11,12.\nSchematic representation of the steps followed by top-down (left) and bottom-up (right) approaches to estimate yield potential in one country.\nAn alternative to the use of top-down spatial frameworks is to follow a \u2018bottom-up\u2019 approach that estimates yield potential and yield gap for a number of sites explicitly chosen to best represent the spatial distribution of crop production area and then upscales the yield potential estimated at those sites to larger spatial scales13(Fig.1and Supplementary Table1). While both spatial frameworks (that is, top down and bottom up) can eventually reach complete coverage of the entire cultivated area, they differ in the means to achieve it and the resulting outcomes. Bottom-up approaches favour the use of measured data on weather, soil and cropping systems and the use of crop simulation models calibrated using data from well-managed experiments where yield-limiting and reducing factors were effectively minimized, which, altogether, should lead to more accurate estimates of yield potential and yield gaps11,14(Extended Data Fig.1). The spatial granularity of the bottom-up approach, in terms of estimating yield potential for a specific combination of climate, soil and cropping systems, allows results to be validated by local experts. Moreover, results for specific locations can be aggregated to regional, national and continental scales by weighting contributions to larger-scale spatial units based on crop production area represented by soil, climate and cropping systems at each location. By contrast, outcomes produced by top-down approaches are difficult to validate because results are necessarily aggregated to the grid level, without differentiating amongst soil types and cropping systems that may exist within the grid. Weather data are also aggregated at the grid scale and may be interpolated from distant weather stations or remotely sensed data.\nYield potential and yield gaps are routinely used as inputs in studies dealing with global food security, biodiversity, land use and climate change6,15,16,17. However, despite the existence of two very different approaches to estimate these two indicators, there has been no explicit attempt to evaluate the performance of top-down versus bottom-up spatial frameworks for estimating yield potential and yield gaps at a local to global scale. We report here a global comparison of the two methods and discuss implications for informing AR&D investments. Our study includes outcomes from two of the most cited studies that utilize top-down approaches: (1) the Global Agro-ecological Zones (GAEZ) model developed by the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis and the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO;http:\/\/www.fao.org\/nr\/gaez\/en\/; refs.18,19) and (2) the median of the model ensemble of the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP) (https:\/\/agmip.org\/; refs.20,21). Yield potential, yield gaps and extra production potential reported in these studies are compared against those derived from the bottom-up approach followed by the Global Yield Gap Atlas (GYGA;www.yieldgap.org; refs.11,13,14).\nBecause effective AR&D requires interventions at different spatial scales, we performed a comparison between top-down and bottom-up approaches at three levels, local, subnational (\u2018climate zone\u2019) and national or subcontinental, with a respective average size of nearly 9,500, 60,000 and 1,000,000 km2. Climate zones are geographic areas with similar temperature and water regimes21. We focus on cereal crops, which account for 45% of global calorie intake (https:\/\/ourworldindata.org\/food-supply). We compare top-down and bottom-up estimates for major cereal crop-producing areas in North and South America, Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia (Extended Data Fig.2). For simplicity, we show examples on four geographic regions and three crops (maize, rice and wheat). The four regions were selected for being important food exporters and\/or importers. As examples of regions with favourable climate and fertile soils (that is, favourable production environments), we include maize in the US Corn Belt, which produces 35% of global maize output, and lowland irrigated and rainfed rice in Asia, which accounts for about 90% of global rice production and about 80% of rice consumption during the 2014\u20132018 period22. As an example of a harsh production environment (less favourable climate and generally infertile soils), we include wheat in Australia, which accounts for 10% of global wheat exports. Maize in sub-Saharan Africa is also included, as this region has rapid population growth rates and domestic cereal demand is projected to increase threefold over the next 30 years23.\nComparison of yield potential derived from top-down (GAEZ and AgMIP) versus bottom-up (GYGA) approaches reveals large discrepancies across all spatial levels. On average, yield potential estimated by AgMIP is 60% lower compared with GYGA across the four case studies (Fig.2), which is consistent with the findings for other crop-producing regions (Supplementary Tables2and3). As a result, AgMIP gives much more conservative estimates of extra crop production potential on existing cropland compared with GYGA across all spatial scales. Agreement between GYGA and GAEZ was better at national and subcontinental scales, although there were still large discrepancies between the two approaches, ranging from \u221250% to +30%. These differences were even larger at smaller spatial scales and for specific regions and crops, with GAEZ estimates differing from GYGA by \u221295% to 480% at local levels (Supplementary Tables2and3). In some cases, yield potential derived from bottom-up and top-down approaches follows the same trend across locations and climate zones, but there remain several substantial disagreements on the absolute level of yield potential. That was the case for maize in the US Corn Belt, where GYGA estimates a yield potential that is 8% and 63% higher than that estimated by GAEZ and AgMIP, respectively (Fig.2a,f). Similarly, estimated yield potential for rainfed wheat in Australia is 46% higher in GYGA than in AgMIP (Fig.2g). Besides poor agreement at the national and continental levels in some cases, other cases show a complete lack of association between the yield potential derived from top-down and bottom-up approaches across locations and climate zones, as it is the case for lowland rainfed rice in Asia and maize in sub-Saharan Africa (Fig.2b,d,f,h). In both regions, the range of yield potential across climate zones is very narrow as estimated following top-down approaches compared with much larger ranges from GYGA. In other words, some of the locations and climate zones reported by GYGA to have the highest yield potential are identified to be among the ones with lowest yield potential by GAEZ and AgMIP and vice versa.\na\u2013h, Yield potential derived from the bottom-up GYGA versus those estimated following the top-down GAEZ (a\u2013d) or AgMIP (e\u2013h) for rainfed (R) and irrigated (I) maize, rice and wheat in four crop-producing regions (United States (a,e), Asia (b,f), Australia (c,g) and sub-Saharan Africa (d,h)) and at three spatial scales: local, regional (climate zone) and national or subcontinental. Each data point represents a long-term average yield potential (10\u201330 years of data, depending on case study). The dashed line indicatesx=y. Comparisons for other cropping systems are shown in Supplementary Tables2and3.\nSource data\nIn addition to evaluating the degree of agreement between top-down and bottom-up approaches, we also assess the quality of yield potential estimation per se by comparing the simulated yield potential against the average farm yield currently achieved in farmers\u2019 fields (actual yields). By definition, the difference between the two, the so-called yield gap (yield potential minus actual yield), cannot be negative. If an estimated yield potential value is considerably lower than average farm yield, then yield potential is clearly underestimated. We find that the top-down approaches give negative yield gaps for a considerable number of cases worldwide (Fig.3and Extended Data Fig.3). At local levels, yield gaps estimated by GAEZ are negative in 13%, 3% and 3% of the 582, 302 and 478 locations evaluated for maize, rice and wheat, respectively. In the case of AgMIP, yield-gap estimates are negative in 39% (maize), 45% (rice) and 25% (wheat) of the cases. In contrast, no negative yield gaps are estimated by GYGA. Because calculation of yield gaps relies on the same source of average actual yield data for both top-down and bottom-up methods (Methods), the substantial number of cases with negative yield gaps as estimated by top-down approaches can be seen as a strong indication of underestimation of yield potential.\nHistogram of yield gap (Yg) estimation for rainfed and irrigated maize, rice and wheat at the local scale using the GYGA, GAEZ and AgMIP frameworks. Arrows indicate the mean yield gap estimated across 582 locations for maize, 302 for rice and 478 for wheat. The vertical dotted line indicates zero yield gap, that is, no difference between yield potential and actual yield.\nSource data\nAlthough achieving food self-sufficiency is not an essential precondition for food security, it can be highly relevant for developing countries with limited capacity to purchase food imports and infrastructure to store and distribute it efficiently24. A key indicator of food security is the self-sufficiency ratio (SSR), which is the ratio between domestic production and total domestic consumption25. Comparison of SSR for different scenarios of yield-gap closure can help assess the degree of food self-sufficiency that a country or region can achieve by increasing productivity on existing cropland26. However, as we showed previously, such an assessment will be influenced by the choice of top-down or bottom-up approach in calculating yield potential, yield gaps and associated extra production potential. For example, self-sufficiency estimates for major cereal crops (maize, sorghum, millet, rice and wheat) vary widely across SSA countries, assuming a production scenario in which average cereal crop yields reach 80% of the yield potential by year 2050 without changes in cropland area (Fig.4). GAEZ forecasts that the region could become self-sufficient for cereal grain by 2050 by an ample margin via narrowing current yield gaps, with the potential production exceeding expected demand by 36% (that is, SSR\u2009=\u20091.36). In contrast, GYGA also estimates that the region could be self-sufficient in cereals if yield gaps are closed, but with production levels very close to the expected demand by 2050 (SSR\u2009=\u20091.03). In the case of AgMIP, estimates of crop production potential fall short of sufficiency, indicating that cropland expansion and\/or increase in food imports will be needed to meet projected cereal demand by 2050 (SSR\u2009=\u20090.96). Discrepancies among approaches become larger when zooming in on specific countries or regions. For example, while GAEZ predicts that yield-gap closure would result in cereal surplus in seven of the ten countries, outputs from GYGA and AgMIP suggest that most of the countries could not meet cereal demand by 2050. While SSR estimates at the subcontinental scale are similar for GYGA and AgMIP, there are large differences in estimated SSR at the national scale, with AgMIP estimations differing from GYGA between \u221224% and 39%.\nThe SSR was calculated as the quotient between production and demand of the most important cereals. The grey portion of the bars represents the SSR by 2050, assuming production level as for 2015; the coloured portion represents the SSR if farmers close the exploitable yield gap (that is, reach 80% of the yield potential). Separate bars are shown for bottom-up (GYGA) and top-down approaches (GAEZ and AgMIP).\nSource data\nA key question for AR&D is where to invest in terms of crops and regions to maximize the return on investment. While yield gap alone is not sufficient to answer this question, together with other biophysical and socioeconomic factors that influence technology adoption, it is an important parameter to guide public and private investments in agriculture, because it specifies where and how much crop production can be increased. Here we show that the choice of spatial framework to make such assessments (that is, top down or bottom up) has important implications for projecting the return on investment. For example, different approaches lead to contrasting answers about the prognosis of a given country to reach a desired level of food self-sufficiency. Even in those cases in which both approaches give similar yield-gap estimates at the subcontinental level, there are large discrepancies when looking at specific countries or regions within each country. The considerable number of locations with a negative yield gap estimated by top-down approaches raises important questions about the accuracy of these approaches in estimating yield potential and gives caution to their use for effective prioritization of AR&D investments. While we focused on extra production potential and food availability, the uncertainty associated with top-down analysis will also apply to other studies focusing on land use, climate change and biodiversity that follow a similar approach to estimate crop production potential7,8.\nCauses of inaccurate estimation of yield gaps following top-down approaches have been investigated elsewhere26,27; here we point out some of them. Top-down approaches are based on secondary (unmeasured) gridded data and coarse global soil maps and cropping systems data (Table1and Supplementary Data Table1), which give a false sense of data quality and availability in spatial grids that are typically 0.5\u20132.0\u00b0 (ca. 3,000\u201350,000 km2at the Equator). Indeed, previous studies have shown important biases when simulating yield potential using coarse gridded weather data compared with simulations based on measured data27,28,29or without proper selection of the dominant soil types within an agricultural area30,31. Similarly, the cropping-system context, including cropping intensity (that is, number of crops per year), crop calendar (sowing window and crop cycle duration) and water regime (irrigated or rainfed), is critical for the estimation of yield potential. While GYGA works with local experts to obtain reliable information about the cropping system context, the two top-down approaches rely on an in silico optimization of the cropping system (GAEZ) or coarse global crop calendars (AgMIP), predicting in many cases crop systems that do not match the dominant existing systems or even systems that simply do not exist (Table1). For example, in the US Corn Belt, the global dataset MIRCA 200032employed by AgMIP sets a maize-sowing window between April and October, but, in reality, producers typically do not sow beyond June to prevent crop loss due to fall frost33. Likewise, top-down approaches generally use generic crop model coefficients that do not account for the specificity of crop cultivars in terms of responses to temperature and photoperiod21,34,35; these models are also rarely validated for their ability to estimate yield potential based on data collected from well-managed crops where yield-limiting and yield-reducing factors have been effectively controlled. In summary, estimates of yield potential and yield gaps derived from top-down approaches are subject to a high degree of uncertainty considering the errors associated with the underpinning data.\nThe accuracy of the spatial sampling framework of the GYGA bottom-up approach has been validated for regions where high-quality and spatially detailed data are available. Hochman et al.36conducted a study on yield gaps of rainfed wheat in Australia following two approaches: (1) the bottom-up approach of GYGA and (2) a data-rich method using high-density data available in the Australian grain zone (both relying on measured weather data). These researchers reported that the two approaches gave similar estimates of yield potential and yield gaps at climate zone and national levels. Similarly, Aramburu Merlos et al.37and Morell et al.38show that national average actual yield estimates for Argentina and the United States, calculated using a limited number of selected locations following the GYGA protocols, were remarkably similar to the reported national average yield based on data from hundreds of subnational-level administrative units covering the entire crop production area. Finally, Van Wart et al.39and van Bussel et al.13showed that variability in weather and simulated yield potential was relatively low for sites located within the same climate zones, which provides further support for a stratified (instead of random) selection of sites and use of the climate zone framework as a basis for upscaling results from location to region and country. Altogether, these studies provide strong evidence of robust estimates of yield potential and yield gaps following the bottom-up approach of the GYGA.\nGiven the \u2018global public goods\u2019 nature of food self-sufficiency estimates across local to global scales, we see an urgent need for robust estimates of yield gaps for major cropping systems worldwide as input to a national and international dialogue on future global food security under climate change. Such a project can be accomplished with a modest investment on a bottom-up approach that gives priority to use primary measured weather data, finer-scale soil maps and accurate cropping systems data for a given location31. We still see a number of areas for complementarity between top-down and bottom-up approaches. For example, the bottom-up approach requires more granular and detailed data on climate, soils and cropping systems than the top-down approaches evaluated in this study, which makes its application difficult in regions where these data are scarce or simply do not exist. In these regions, it may be necessary to rely on top-down approaches that obtain the required data by interpolation and informed guesses using data from coarser spatial scales. Similarly, top-down modellers may benefit from using bottom-up estimates of yield potential, and underpinning weather and soil databases, to evaluate their model outcomes. We conclude that foresight studies of food security, land use and climate change and associated priority setting on AR&D based on yield potential and yield gaps would benefit from using a bottom-up spatial framework and good-quality data to reduce uncertainties in previously reported estimates of food production potential under current and future climates.\nYield potential (Yp; megagrams per harvested hectare) is defined as the yield of a cultivar in an environment to which it is adapted, when grown with sufficient water and nutrients in the absence of abiotic and biotic stress40. In irrigated fields, Yp is determined by solar radiation, temperature, atmospheric CO2concentration and management practices that influence crop cycle duration and light interception, such as sowing date, cultivar maturity and plant density. In rainfed systems where water supply from stored soil water at sowing and in-season precipitation is not enough to meet crop water requirements, water-limited Yp (Yw) is determined by water supply amount and its distribution during the growing season, as well as by soil properties influencing the crop\u2013water balance, such as the rootable soil depth, texture and terrain slope. Actual yield is defined as the average grain yield (megagrams per harvested hectare) obtained by farmers for a given crop with a given water regime. The difference between Yp (or Yw) and farmer actual yield is known as the yield gap11. In the case of irrigated crops, Yp is the proper benchmark to estimate yield gaps, while Yw is the meaningful benchmark for rainfed crops. With good, cost-effective crop management, reaching 70\u201380% of Yp (or Yw) is a reasonable target for farmers with good access to markets, inputs and extension services, which is usually referred to as \u2018attainable yield\u201941,42. Beyond this yield level, the small return to extra input requirement and labour does not justify the associated financial and environmental costs and level of sophistication in crop and soil management practices.\nWe retrieved data generated from two initiatives following a top-down approach: (1) the GAEZ (http:\/\/www.fao.org\/nr\/gaez\/en\/; refs.18,19) and (2) the AgMIP (https:\/\/agmip.org\/data-and-tools-updated\/; refs.20,21). As the bottom-up approach, we used results from the GYGA (www.yieldgap.org; refs.11,31,43). The main features of these databases are summarized elsewhere (Supplementary Table1and Supplementary Section1). In the process of selecting the specific dataset, we explicitly attempted to reduce biases in the comparisons to the extent this was possible. For example, in all cases, we used simulations that meet the yield definitions provided in the previous section. We also tried to be consistent in terms of the time period for which Yp (or Yw) was simulated; however, this was not always possible, because while GAEZ and AgMIP use weather datasets that cover the time period between 1961 and 1990 and between 1980 and 2010, respectively, GYGA uses more recent weather data (Supplementary Table1). Similarly, comparisons between databases were limited to those regions for which there were estimates of Yp (or Yw) for each of the top-down and bottom-up approaches. More detailed information about the three approaches can be found in Supplementary Section1. We acknowledge that, when assessing different approaches, it is conceivable that there would be an inherent bias depending on who performs it and his\/her preference. Although the authors of this current study have all contributed to the development of GYGA, we have maintained neutrality when conducting the analysis and made inferences solely based on the results shown here, avoiding any inherent bias. Additionally, methods and data sources are fully documented and publicly accessible for other researchers who may be interested in replicating our comparison.\nComparison of the three databases needs to account for the different spatial resolution at which the data are reported (grid in GAEZ and AgMIP versus buffer in GYGA). In the present study, we compared Yp (or Yw) among the three databases at three spatial levels: local (also referred to as buffer), climate zone (CZ) and country (or subcontinent). An example of the three spatial levels evaluated in this study as well as the Yw estimated by each of the three databases for rainfed maize is shown in Extended Data Fig.4. We note that buffer is the lowest spatial level at which Yp and Yw are reported in GYGA. For a country such as the United States, where maize production is concentrated on flat geographic areas, the average size of buffers and CZs selected by GYGA is 17,000 and 60,000 km2, respectively; the size is smaller for countries with greater terrain and climate heterogeneity, such as Ethiopia, where the average size of buffers and CZs selected for maize by GYGA is a respective 4,000 and 21,000 km2, or for smaller countries, such as in Europe.\nThe GYGA already provides estimates of Yp (or Yw) and yield gaps at those three spatial levels. Following a bottom-up approach, GYGA estimates the Yp (or Yw) at the buffer level based on the Yp (or Yw) simulated for each crop cycle and soil type (within a given buffer) and their associated harvested area (within that same buffer) using a weighted average. Subsequently, Yp (or Yw) at buffer levels are upscaled to CZ, national or subcontinental levels using a weighted average based on harvested area retrieved from the Spatial Production Allocation Model (SPAM) 201044. Details on the GYGA upscaling method can be found in van Bussel et al.13In the case of top-down approaches, for comparison purposes, it was necessary to aggregate Yp (or Yw) reported for each individual grid into buffers, CZs and countries in order to make them comparable to those reported by GYGA. To do so, Yp (or Yw) from GAEZ and AgMIP was scaled up to buffer, climate zone and country (or subnational levels) considering the crop-specific area within each pixel, as reported by SPAM 201044. For example, for a given buffer, the average Yp (or Yw) was estimated using a weighted average, in which the value of Yp (or Yw) reported for each of the GAEZ or AgMIP grids located within the GYGA buffer was \u2018weighted\u2019 according to the SPAM crop-specific area within that grid. The same approach was used to estimate average Yp (or Yw) at the CZ and country (or subcontinental) levels for GAEZ and AgMIP.\nFor a given buffer, CZ or country (or subcontinent), the yield gap was calculated as the difference between Yp (or Yw) and the average farmer yield (actual yield, Ya). The Yp and Yw were taken as the appropriate benchmarks to estimate yield gaps for irrigated and rainfed crops, respectively. To avoid biases due to the source of average actual yield in the estimation of yield gap, we used the average actual yield dataset from GYGA, because it provides estimates of average actual yield disaggregated by water regime for the most recent time period. Actual yield data from GYGA were retrieved from official statistics available at subnational administrative units such as municipalities, counties, departments and subdistrict. The exact number of years of data to calculate average yield is determined by GYGA on a case-by-case basis, following the principle of including as many recent years of data as possible to account for weather variability while avoiding the bias due to a technological time trend and long-term climate change31. Using the GYGA database on average actual yield for estimation of yield gaps does not bias the results from our study, as GYGA favours the use of official sources of average yields at the finer available spatial resolution, which is the same source of actual yield data used by other databases such as FAO and SPAM22,44. In this study, we opted not to use actual yield data from GAEZ, because they derived from FAOSTAT statistics of the years 2000 and 2005, and thus, they could lead to an overestimation of the yield gap in those regions where actual yields have increased over the past two decades19. Finally, extra production potential was calculated based on the yield gap estimated by each approach and the SPAM crop-specific harvested area reported for each buffer, CZ and country (or subcontinent). The top-down and bottom-up approaches were compared in a total of 67 countries, which together account for 74%, 67% and 43% of global maize, rice and wheat harvested areas, respectively (Extended Data Fig.2). Overall, our comparison included a total of 1,362 buffers located within 870 CZs, with 422 buffers (within 249 CZs) for rainfed maize, 160 buffers (116 CZs) for irrigated maize, 93 buffers (66 CZs) for rainfed rice, 209 buffers (114 CZs) for irrigated rice, 400 buffers (274 CZs) for rainfed wheat and 78 buffers (49 CZs) for irrigated wheat. In all cases, Yp (or Yw), yield gaps and extra production potential were expressed at standard commercial moisture content (that is, 15.5% for maize, 14% for rice and 13.5% for wheat).\nWe assessed the agreement in Yp (or Yw), yield gap, and extra production potential between GYGA and the two databases that follow a top-down approach (GAEZ and AgMIP) separately for each of the spatial levels (buffer, CZ, country or subcontinent) by calculating root-mean-square error (RMSE) and absolute mean error (ME):\nwhereYTDandYBUare the estimated Yp (or Yw), yield gap, or extra production potential for databaseifollowing a top-down approach and for GYGA, respectively, andnis the number of pairedYTDversusYBUcomparisons at a given spatial scale for a given crop in a given country. Separate comparisons were performed for irrigated and rainfed crops.\nWe assessed the impact of discrepancies in Yp (or Yw) between top-down and bottom-up approaches on the SSR, which is an important indicator for food security. To do so, we focused on cereal crops in sub-Saharan Africa, and we calculated the SSR for the five main cereal crops in this region (that is, maize, millet, rice, sorghum and wheat) following van Ittersum et al.23. Millet and sorghum were included in the analysis of SSR in sub-Saharan Africa, because together they account for ca. 25% of the total cereal production and ca. 40% of the total cereal harvested area in this region (average over the 2015\u20132019 period)22. Briefly, we computed current national demand (assumed equal to the 2015 consumption) and the 2015 production of the five cereals to estimate the baseline SSR (that is, in 2015) in ten countries for which Yw (or Yp) data were available in GYGA. Current total cereal demand per country were calculated as the product of current population size derived from United Nations population prospects and cereal demand per capita based on the International Model for Policy Analysis of Agricultural Commodities and Trade (IMPACT)35,45. The annual per-capita demand for the five cereals was expressed in maize yield equivalents by using the crop-specific grain caloric contents, with caloric contents based on FAO food balances46. Current domestic grain production per cereal crop per country (approximately 2015) was calculated as mean actual crop yield (2003\u20132012) as estimated in GYGA times the 2015 harvested area per crop by FAO22. Total future annual cereal demand per capita (2050), for each of the five cereals and each country, was retrieved from IMPACT modelling results35using the shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP2, no climate change) from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change fifth assessment47. Total cereal demand per country in 2050 was calculated based on projected 2050 population (medium-fertility variant of United Nations population prospects;https:\/\/population.un.org\/wpp\/) multiplied by the per-capita cereal demand in 2050 from the SSP2 scenario. In our study, we assumed an attainable yield of 80% of Yw for rainfed crops, which is consistent with the original approach followed by van Ittersum et al.23, but, in our study, we also used 80% of Yp for irrigated crops as an estimate of the attainable yield, instead of 85% as in van Ittersum et al.23, to be slightly more conservative. Because the goal was to understand the level of SSR on existing cropland, we assumed no expansion of rainfed or irrigated cropland and no change in net planted area for each of the cereal crops. Our calculations for sub-Saharan Africa may be too pessimistic if genetic progress to increase Yp is achieved. Historically, genetic progress in Yp has contributed to progress in farm yields, although the magnitude of Yp increase is debatable. Progress in elevating Yp of the major cereals would imply, however, that even larger yield gaps need to be overcome than the already large gaps reported herein. Hence, we did not account for changes in genetic Yp in our calculation of SSR by 2050, also because climate change is likely to have a negative effect on Yp and Yw in sub-Saharan Africa.\nFurther information on research design is available in theNature Research Reporting Summarylinked to this article.\nData on yield potential and actual yield from GYGA are available atwww.yieldgap.org.

Here, we conducted a scoping review of the literature on FO services and their impacts on small-scale producers in sub-Saharan Africa and India. Most reviewed studies (57%) reported positive FO impacts on farmer income, but much fewer reported positive impacts on crop yield (19%) and production quality (20%). Environmental benefits, such as resilience-building and improved water quality and quantity were documented in 24% of the studies. Our analysis indicates that having access to markets through information, infrastructure, and logistical support at the centre of FO design could help integrate FOs into policy. Natural resource management should also be more widely incorporated in the services provided by FOs to mitigate risks associated with environmental degradation and climate change. Finally, farmers who are already marginalized because of poor education, land access, social status and market accessibility may require additional support systems to improve their capacities, skills and resources before they are able to benefit from FO membership.\nThe adoption of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015 signalled a global commitment to combat hunger and improve the well-being of small-scale producers and the environment. Small-scale producers contribute substantially to the food supply1,2,3, yet many experience food insecurity4. They are also highly vulnerable to climate change and environmental degradation5with particular severity in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and South and East Asia6.\nFarmer organizations (FOs) such as associations, cooperatives, producer organizations, self-help and women\u2019s groups, are collective institutions intended to support members\u2019 interests7,8. FOs may help small-scale producers access markets, credit and rural extension services9,10as well as manage shared natural resources11. FOs can build farmer skills in production, marketing and leadership and strengthen psychological well-being12. Building on these contributions to farmers, FOs have become core elements of rural development, agricultural productivity and anti-poverty policies\u2014especially in Africa and South Asia13,14.\nQuestions have arisen about the equity of FOs, including whether they serve mainly middle-class farmers, rather than the poorest and most vulnerable farmers15,16. In some contexts, FO benefits have been shown to vary depending on the crops grown, farmers\u2019 access to resources and membership heterogeneity14,17. Experience from Kenya, Ethiopia and South Africa also indicates that FOs often depend on support from governments and other agencies18,19and that the benefits of FOs to individual members can be limited by production volumes, infrastructure challenges and inadequate banking services, as well as limited managerial and leadership skills16,20.\nMore evidence on the impact of FOs is urgently needed for governments and donor organizations to identify effective interventions to achieve the SDGs, including target 2.1 to fight hunger, 2.3 to improve the income of smallholders and 2.4 to promote environmentally friendly agricultural practices and responses to climate change. Although several studies have reviewed the contributions of FOs towards those objectives, most have focused on a subset of FO types and\/ or individual countries12,21,22. Many have not applied a systematic approach23.\nHere we explore the contributions of FO membership by reviewing the scientific literature on the impacts of FOs on small-scale producers in SSA and India\u2014both of which have a long tradition of cooperatives and other FOs24,25. More specifically, we analyse the findings of 239 studies to elicit the contributions of FOs to income, empowerment, agricultural production, food security and the environment. Details of the literature screening and eligibility criteria can be found in the Methods and inBox 1.\nThe 239 studies included in this scoping review document FOs in 24 countries (Fig.1). All studies were published between 2000 and 2019, most (192, or 80% of the total) since 2010. The majority used quantitative methodologies (53%) and involved at least 100 respondents (64%).\nThe map shows the number of studies analysing FOs included in the review by country (n=\u2009239) in each of the 24 countries considered.\nThe reviewed studies included seven types of FOs (Fig.2b): agricultural cooperatives, farmer associations and groups, rural self-help groups and women\u2019s groups, dairy cooperatives, producer groups, natural resource management groups and rural financial cooperatives.\na, Representation of services in the included studies (n=\u2009239). Most of the studies reported the delivery of multiple services, thus the sum across all the services is above 100%.b, Services with the highest representation in the studies by FO type.c, Services with the lowest representation in the studies by FO type. Most of the studies delivered multiple services, thus the sum across all the services is greater than 100%. Financial cooperatives did not provide any of these services.\nWe characterized the studies by FO membership and crop type, where relevant. Out of 228 studies that provided data on membership, 171 studies (75%) involved FOs with open membership, unrestricted by gender, age or any other qualification. The other studies (25%) had exclusively or mostly women members (Supplementary Fig.1.3).\nOf the 238 studies that provided data on type of production, more than half (132, or 55% of the total) focused on crop production alone and included FOs working with cereals, vegetables, coffee and fruits; 24% (56 studies) focused on livestock only, and 21% (51 studies) focused on both crop and livestock production (Supplementary Figure1.3). Agricultural cooperatives and farmers\u2019 associations had the strongest focus on crop production (73% and 68% respectively). We found only limited information on other FO characteristics, such as membership costs (found for 37 studies, 15%) (Supplementary Fig.1.4).\nThe services FOs provided to their members can be grouped into 11 categories (Fig.2), of which the most common (129 studies, 54%) was \u2018marketing services to increase product sales\u2019 (such as connecting to specific markets to sell products, shared transport or storage of the products and the establishment of contacts between FO members and buyers). The second most common category was \u2018providing access to market information\u2019 on product prices and trends, seasonality and regional changes (111 studies, 46%). The third most common was \u2018extension and educational services\u2019, which both promote improved production and marketing practices, as well as build financial literacy (89 studies, 37%). The first and third categories were widely represented regardless of the type of FO or membership. Other services, such as linking farmers to external programmes, infrastructure development\/management and policy advocacy with local\/sub-national governments, were also found in some FOs, but their frequency in the reviewed studies is low.\nMost studies described FOs that provided multiple services, but 25 of the studies (4%) focused on FOs that solely provided financial services, including financial cooperatives and rural self-help and women\u2019s groups. FOs offering multiple services typically addressed output marketing, market information and extension services and were analysed by 32% of the studies. They were mostly agricultural or dairy cooperatives, farmer associations and groups. Studies focused on the FOs from India show that rural self-help groups and women\u2019s groups tended to deliver financial, extension and education services such as certification and improved production practices, financial literacy, marketing skills and skills for income generation, strengthening members\u2019 access to income, savings, credit and empowerment.\nThe observed FO impacts could be grouped into six categories: income, yield, production quality, environment, empowerment and food security (Fig.3a). Of the 239 studies, 98 (41%) focused on a single measurable impact (that is \u2018improved\u2019 or \u2018not improved\u2019) in response to FO membership.\na, Proportions of studies reporting different types of impact (as percentage of studies in that category,n=\u2009239).b, Positive impacts by type of production and membership in the studies.c, Positive impacts by FO type.d, Positive impacts by FO services. The sum of improvements and no improvements does not add up to 100% for each impact because not all the studies analysed the respective impacts. Most (59%) of the studies delivered multiple impacts, thus the sum across all of the services is greater than 100%.\nSixty-seven per cent of the studies (161) reported only cases of improvement (in one or more impact categories) associated with FO membership; 21% (50) reported both cases of improvements and cases of non-improvements (in one or more impact categories). Finally, 12% of studies (28) reported only cases of no measurable improvement (in one or more of the impact categories studied).\nChanges in income are the most investigated impact, included in 174 studies (73%). Of the 239 studies, 58% identified positive impacts on income and only 15% saw no improvements at all. These income improvements were mostly delivered by FOs engaged in crop production (55%) and with no restriction on membership (67%) (Fig.3b). The proportion of studies that reported improvement in incomes is similar across FO types (Fig.3c), except for natural resource management groups (mostly water and forest user associations), for which only a third of the studies reported positive effects. More than two-thirds of the studies analysing self-help and women\u2019s groups reported improvement in incomes.\nAmong the services offered by FOs, marketing assistance for farm products and services that provide access to market information have the highest association with improvement in incomes (Fig.3d). Extension and financial services also seem to play a positive role, but natural resource management services do not seem to translate into short-term improvement in incomes. Our data, however, do not indicate whether income gains are achieved through a combination of these services or whether a few services on their own have a large influence on improving incomes.\nIn the studies that quantified changes in income (33, or 14%), increases ranged widely from 3% to 70% over the studied period (often between 2 and 5\u2009years). Out of our 239 studies, 7 (3%) reported inconsistent income gains characterized by fluctuations over years and seasons. Such fluctuations were attributed to external and socio-demographic factors such as commodity prices, weather and climate impacts, crop and livestock losses caused by pests and diseases, varying product quality and insufficient family labour, or illness of household members26,27. However, 25 studies (10%) mentioned that FOs assisted famers to stabilize their income through access to reliable markets, higher bargaining power with wholesalers and retailers, and more stable prices through access to consistent and reliable markets. This indicates that FOs have the ability to mitigate risks that cause fluctuations in the incomes of their members.\nAfter income gains, improved production quality was the next most commonly reported impact. Changes in production quality were typically measured in terms of improved quality of crops, especially fruits and coffee, as well as dairy products. Positive contributions to production quality were reported in 48 studies (20%) whereas no improvements in production quality could be identified in 13 studies (5%). Positive impacts on production quality were mostly delivered by FOs engaged in crop production (65%) and in FOs with no restriction on membership (79%) (Fig.3b).\nWith few exceptions, the share of studies that find positive impacts of FOs on production quality is similar across FO types. Studies analysing rural self-help and women\u2019s groups provide few accounts of production quality improvements and there seems to be no association between financial cooperatives and quality improvements (Fig.3c).\nThe reported improvements in production quality are mostly driven by marketing information and output marketing services, as reported in around two-thirds of the studies (Fig.3d). This mostly related to a switch to organic production, stronger connections with buyers and improved value chains, as found by Bezecon28. The provision of extension and input marketing services also seems to matter, as indicated in one-third of the studies, mostly focused on improved practices in the field, collection and storage. Other types of FO services seem to have a limited association with production quality improvements.\nTypically, indicators to measure changes in yield include amount produced per hectare or per animal for livestock, volume of dairy products and reductions in crop losses. Positive contributions to yield were delivered in 46 studies (19%), while no improvements in yield were listed in 27 studies (11%). Positive impacts on yield were mostly delivered by FOs engaged in crop production (70%) with no restriction on membership (87%) (Fig.3b).\nImprovements in yield were mostly driven by producer groups, farmers\u2019 associations and agricultural cooperatives, for which approximately one-quarter of the studies reported yield improvements. Studies analysing other FO types reported yield improvements much less often or, in the case of financial cooperatives, did not report any improvements (Fig.3c).\nAs in the case of impacts on incomes, output marketing services seem to matter the most for yield improvements. Extension services and access to market information are the other two services that are associated with higher yields (Fig.3d). A greater capacity of producers to deploy sophisticated inputs and management practices, as a result mainly of FO extension services in combination with access to inputs, may have a strong effect on members\u2019 yield levels, as found in Chindi et al.29and Wassie at al.30. Extension services provided by FOs have been shown to have positive impacts specifically on the use of fertilizers or high-quality and climate-resilient seeds31.\nIn 57 studies (24%), there were documented improvements in environmental parameters mostly in terms of resilience-building such as flood protection, wetland management to promote nature-based solutions to climate change, water and land conservation practices to respond to climate change impacts, improved water quality and quantity and soil conditions, and reduced erosion. All these factors contribute to longer-term yield improvement, sustainable production and risk reduction, so they can be expected to have measurable long-term effects on farmer income (beyond the period of study).\nHowever, 15 studies (6%) mentioned no improvements or negative impacts on the environment, mostly relating to water pollution and land clearing. Positive impacts on the environment were mostly delivered by FOs engaged in crop production (53%) with no restriction on membership (78%) (Fig.3b).\nUnsurprisingly, positive environmental impacts are predominantly reported by studies focused on natural resource management FOs. Only a few studies concerned with FOs for economic support, such as agricultural and dairy cooperatives, report positive environmental impacts (Fig.3c). However, it is possible that studies that focus on FOs oriented towards economic support do not measure environmental impacts. In these cases, any positive impacts in terms of income and yield may have actually resulted from sustainable practices such as improved soil and water management as well as adaptation responses to climate change impacts. The only substantial impacts were adaptation to climate change and resilience-building (11 studies, or 4.6%) and implementation of organic farming methods (10 studies, or 4.2%). There were also examples of engagement in forest and biodiversity management, addressing water quality and availability and the use of renewable energy. These activities were motivated by production needs such as irrigation or energy for processing and storage (for example Bekele and Ando32) or as the outcome of particular government support campaigns to improve irrigation, for example33.\nEnvironmental improvements were delivered by specific services targeting natural resource management (mostly water, forest and pasture) as well as outcomes of market information and output marketing (Fig.3d). In addition, studies focusing on other types of FOs that deliver extension and marketing services also reported environmental improvements, as some of the promoted management practices aimed at better yields (such as small-scale irrigation and targeted fertilizer application) were provided by FO extension services that in turn contribute to improved water quality and quantity34. Management practices promoted by such FOs, aimed at improving yields and\/or resource use efficiency (such as small-scale irrigation and targeted fertilizer application), were also found to contribute to improved water quality and quantity34.\nFor natural resource management groups, livelihoods were strengthened and made more resilient through improvements in the quality or quantity of forest resources, irrigation water or pasture. More predictable and secure access to forest resources also provided a risk management strategy to deal with income fluctuation, as illustrated by Maretzki26, Ingabire et al.27and others.\nOf the studies on self-help and women\u2019s groups\u2014predominantly located in India\u2014about 20% reported improvements in food security and 31% in social empowerment. Natural resource management groups are the other type of FOs reporting such benefits, although present in very few studies. Empowerment was measured through self-reported increases in confidence and psychological well-being and participation in domestic decision-making, as well as improved business knowledge, leadership and management skills, and engagement in civic affairs. Approximately 20% of the studies mentioned the importance of higher income and access to credit to pay school fees, health care costs or to increase savings. The information on food security benefits is limited, with only 19 studies (8%) addressing this parameter. These studies focused on assistance related to food access through income fluctuations as well as through increasing food availability due to extension support and access to inputs resulting in yield improvements.\nStudies were also assessed for their reporting of factors that could have mitigated or strengthened the impacts of the FOs\u2019 membership and service delivery. These were placed in two groups, concerned with external and socio-economic factors, as detailed below.\nTo assess the reported role of external factors on FO services, we first focused on support provided by national governments to FOs (Fig.4). Of the studies reviewed, 40% reported that FOs received government support in the form of input and investment subsidies, conditional and unconditional cash transfers, infrastructure support programmes to develop roads, irrigation, storage facilities and others, non-targeted support to assist with start-up costs, government-financed extension services and tax exemptions on FO products. Besides government support, 25% of the reviewed studies mentioned support from local non-governmental organization (NGOs), international projects or donor initiatives. Across the various types of FO, the highest rate of government support was reported in studies of natural resource management groups (60%), although a higher share of farmers\u2019 associations and groups received external support when NGOs were included.\nBars indicate the proportion of each type of FO receiving support from national governments. In total, 40% of the reviewed studies reported some sort of support from national governments to FOs. Government support may include input and investment subsidies, conditional and unconditional cash transfers, infrastructure support programmes to develop roads, irrigation, storage facilities and others, non-targeted support to assist with start-up costs, government-financed extension services and tax exemptions on FO products.\nOther external factors beyond government or NGO support have been reported relating to climatic, weather and extreme events that affected production, changes in local administration and migration. From these three factors, climate variability and related effects were mentioned in 30 studies (12.6%) because of their negative implications for production and yield. Local administration was listed in 17 studies (7.1%) which typically stressed the importance of relationships with local governments to improve the ability of FOs to successfully deliver services.\nSome of the reviewed studies identified specific recommendations for government policies to assist in service delivery and strengthen the impacts of FOs. The most common suggestion was to direct government support to FOs through extension services, access to credit and support for market access, as well as infrastructure investment (28 studies, 12%); and strengthening natural resource management policies, mostly on water management and climate change adaptation (27 studies, 11%).\nFinally, our scoping review identified a small number of studies (14, or 6%) that referred to interactions with the private sector in terms of FOs\u2019 contracts with input companies, interactions with private-sector buyers, engagement in contract farming and private sector-driven extension provision.\nFO impacts can vary between members as households are highly heterogeneous in terms of their socio-economic characteristics and ability to take advantage of FO services. Sixty-eight of our studies identified factors influencing membership and service delivery (Table1). These factors (which are inter-related) include gender and gender relations, access to land, education and poverty levels and remoteness\/access to infrastructure. We also found four studies (1.7%) that identified support to purchase inputs for production or access education for poor households21,35.\nAs our scoping review shows, the literature on the impacts of FO membership on small-scale agricultural producers covers different types of FO in multiple countries of SSA and India. Positive impacts on farmers\u2019 income, yield and production were found, as well as some benefits for food security and the environment.\nOur review revealed that FO services that enhance access to markets\u2014for example, product marketing and market information\u2014have positive impacts on member income as well as yield and product quality. This is consistent with the broader literature, which argues that the diverse services that FOs provide to connect small-scale producers to markets lead to positive impacts by assisting the individual members to overcome challenges such as low quantity or quality of products and frequent supply constraints, as well as by assisting with skill development and access to inputs22. In addition, access to financial services was shown in our findings to be critical to achieve improved income23. Member access to credit will be even more crucial for FOs to respond to future challenges such as climate change impacts and risk management, which require additional investments in climate-resilient crops, irrigation or insurance36.\nExtension and educational services delivered by FOs have a substantial presence across all types of FOs in our review and delivered positive impacts. These services addressed skill, knowledge and information deficiencies that the members faced in relation to production decisions and practices. Types of services included information about input application, farming practices and production systems; market information; health and safety; and managerial and business skills\u2014as well as knowledge about environmental stewardship and sustainability. These services would ideally be bundled flexibly and responsively to meet specific and dynamic local production constraints and market opportunities. In practice, however, providing these services to individual ssmall farmers is costly; collectives such as FOs make extension services more cost effective and feasible23. FOs can provide the institutional infrastructure for effective knowledge management, applied research and practical innovation to respond to diverse local production constraints or changing market conditions. Our results reinforce the value of extension services in the context of FOs and are consistent with literature findings that FO extension services benefit smallholders by improving financial literacy and the uptake of sustainable practices to achieve productivity and income gains36,37.\nWe infer from these results that policy development and programming should support FOs in the effective delivery of services that provide access to markets\u2014both input and output\u2014through targeted market information, infrastructure investment to improve market access mostly focused on road development, logistical support and extension to improve outcomes across different forms of FOs. Smallholders would probably benefit from FO provision of financial services such as consolidating and administering small-scale loans, seasonal input financing or crop insurance schemes based on measurable climate parameters (such as rainfall) rather than complex, case-by-case yield calculations. This set of multiple services for extension, infrastructure, market and financial services should be central to the design of FOs.\nIn terms of avenues for future research, our scoping review indicates that the benefits provided by a given FO may differ between individual members14,38. Although we found information comparing benefits for marginalized groups (as discussed below), this aspect of the analysis warrants further research. Similarly, further investigation of the positive spill-over effects39of FOs on non-members and local communities would strengthen the case for FOs in supporting smallholder livelihoods.\nReviewed studies mostly focused on those smallholder households with sufficient resources to benefit from engagement in FOs. Although the broader literature identifies several characteristics, such as farm size, gender of the household head, education and age, that influence FO membership and the heterogeneity of impacts40, our findings reveal that distance of households from markets is also an important variable hindering FO benefits. Gassner et al.41argue for differentiating among smallholders on the basis of the availability of resources. Households engaged in small-scale farming as a livelihood may have varying income and assets, resources to reinvest in agriculture or access to better-paid non-farm jobs to transition out of farming38. Those households that are on the margin and lack resources are likely to incur higher transaction costs to access FO services39and thus need to be supported, while possible barriers and incentives need to be carefully revisited to make FOs more accessible42.\nThe gender of the household head was a prominent factor; studies suggest that benefits such as income, yield and production quality are lower for female-headed farm households40. FOs seem to be less effective for younger, less literate and female farmers, even if they become members. In addition, women (both married and unmarried) are often constrained in their ability to take advantage of FO services to improve crop yield, production systems and marketing. Some studies suggest that the homogeneity of women\u2019s self-help groups positively affected women\u2019s likelihood of joining, as a higher proportion of female members is more appealing to other women43. In India, rural self-help groups and women\u2019s cooperatives show positive impacts on women\u2019s empowerment and access to credit, but often limited impact on domestic gender relations44.\nOur results on gender, combined with our results on the other characteristics of marginalization (for example, distance to market) indicate that marginalized groups of farmers are less likely to participate in or to benefit from participation in FOs. This implies that policy development and programming in Africa and India should focus on the levers that induce them to more actively engage in FOs. Marginalized small-scale farmers may require different support systems to first improve their capacities, skills and resources as well as connections to infrastructure before they are able to benefit from FO membership. With regards to gender, policy development and programming should focus on improving the participation of women in FOs. One way is to mobilize women to form female-focused FOs and provide support through agricultural extension aimed at building the abilities of women farmers in areas such as production technology uptake and marketing45.\nThis scoping review found a very low number of studies evaluating the contributions of FOs to food security compared with studies on improving income. This may also be due to our sample selection criteria, which may have resulted in studies that focused on non-marginalized small farmers for whom food security may not be a research outcome of interest.\nGains to food security attributable to FOs require additional research, as few previous studies examined this relationship. Although marginal, remote and socially disadvantaged households are the ones who typically suffer from food insecurity and who would gain most from FO participation, the studies show that marginalized producers are particularly difficult to engage in FOs for the reasons discussed above. It is also worth further studying food security impacts among more prosperous farmers, as improvements in indicators such as income or yield do not always translate into better food security or nutrition if, for example, households spend additional income on non-food items46.\nWe suggest that a distinction be made by policymakers between food security versus income or poverty reduction when prioritizing interventions in smallholder agriculture. For marginalized farmers who have limited capacity to benefit from FO membership, food security challenges require different interventions. Instead of improving production systems or market access, these might instead focus on, for example, basic social protections, income support, nutritional supplements or seasonal food security packs41.\nNatural resource-based FOs were able to address soil erosion, improve water availability and contribute to reforestation and forest rehabilitation, thereby improving member resilience through access to higher-quality resources. These impacts were mostly achieved using targeted services to strengthen collective management of water, forest and pasture. The extensive work on common pool resources has demonstrated the ability of self-organized collectives to sustain key resources47and our results align well with this body of work. Research more specific to FOs has shown, for example, that FOs designed for collective forest, water and pasture resource management in Africa and other parts of the world48,49have resulted in positive impacts for members.\nSome studies reported that climate change and weather events affected FO members\u2019 ability to produce and sell crops due to negative impacts on harvest and impacts on markets and related infrastructure. To promote sustainable agricultural practices and address climate risk, FOs should reassess whether input use, extension services, production technologies and resource management practices are consistent with sustainability and climate resilience criteria. This could lead to greater attention to sustainable production practices and more judicious natural resource management to preserve ecosystem function under increased climate stress. These additional complexities will challenge FOs to devote more resources to innovation but they will become increasingly important to ensure the sustainability of agricultural production systems and risk-adjusted returns to farmers50.\nOur findings show that fluctuations in farmers\u2019 incomes in FOs is at least partly because of climate change-induced uncertainties, but at the same time we find that very few types of FO offer natural resource management services. The type of FOs that predominantly focus on natural resource management seem to be successful in delivering positive environmental impacts. The literature also suggests that other types of FO targeting the environment may improve yields, but not report on these services51. The implication of these findings for policy development and programming is that broader ecosystem and natural resource management should be more widely incorporated in the extension services of FOs to mitigate the risk induced by environmental degradation and climate change. This may require better documentation of current practices that contribute to the environment, as well as training and investment in innovation for FOs to demonstrate the benefits of new, more sustainable practices\u2014so that they feel confident promoting such practices in agricultural systems.\nThe literature shows that, on the one hand, governments play a substantial role in creating and supporting FOs. They can provide initial financial assistance15,16as well as long-term support to increase asset levels that contribute to FOs\u2019 competitiveness and investment opportunities9. Moreover, government-subsidized FOs can become a buyer of last resort for farmers to sell their products, but often at lower prices than they would receive in a market52. Product price fluctuations were a substantial feature in many of the reviewed studies, so improved price stability was an important benefit of FO membership. Contrastingly, external support can also prop up weak and dysfunctional FOs and prolong inefficiencies53, with FO membership possibly representing a way of insulating small-scale producers from the hardships of essential structural change53.\nGiven the important role of governments in creating and supporting FOs, as well as the potential for political interference, the data extraction criteria used here identified available information on government and\/or donor support for FOs, as well as cases where FOs do not provide the details of such support.\nOur findings suggest generally positive evidence for the ability of FOs to provide important benefits to their members, and although only a minority of studies explicitly identify the role of government in the FOs that they study, this role was mostly a constructive one. There is abundant support in the broader literature23for widespread participation in FOs; governments can be more proactive in supporting them by promoting legal frameworks for FO operation and providing access to credit and extension services to enable more widespread and effective engagement of small-scale farmers in FOs. Finally, while the contribution of government and support of NGOs can be substantial, the connections between this support and FO benefits has not been well documented in our sample of studies, indicating the need for additional research to explore the supporting role of governments and other entities in FO performance. Specific investigation of FO engagement in politics and policy, as well as the influence of governmental and other programmes on these FOs, would be beneficial to gain a fuller picture of FO contributions to members\u2019 livelihoods and environmental sustainability.\nIn addition to the government and NGO support to FOs, there is a growing interest in engagement with the private sector54. The number of studies assessing the impacts of such engagement was low in our review. Future research should focus on exploring whether the nature of supporting organization (government\/NGO\/private players) makes much difference in the performance of FOs.\nA final caveat is that the papers in our sample may be subject to publication bias, as studies reporting positive results concerning FO impacts are more likely to be published than studies reporting insignificant or negative results. Twenty-eight of the studies included in our review (12%) provide accounts of no measurable improvement in FO members\u2019 livelihoods. However, we cannot rule out the possibility of a larger publication bias because of this preference for positive results55,56.\nScoping reviews do not seek to \u2018synthesize\u2019 evidence nor aggregate findings from different studies57,58, but rather provide a narrative or descriptive account of available research without focusing on the strength of evidence58. Other types of review that do require quality appraisal, such as systematic reviews, often include a lower number of studies than scoping reviews57. The outcomes of scoping reviews can include policy and practice recommendations and suggestions for areas of study that are not currently well addressed in the literature.\nThis scoping review was prepared following guidelines from the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR)59. This approach comprises five steps: (1) identifying the research question (that is, \u201cwhat are the services that farmer organizations provide to members, and what impacts do those services have on small-scale producers\u2019 livelihoods and the environment?\u201d); (2) identifying relevant studies using pre-determined definitions (see Box1); (3) study selection; (4) extracting and charting the data; and (5) collating, summarizing and reporting the results.\nRural producers that meet at least two of the four following criteria: land size, labour availability (especially family members), market orientation (that is, whether production is for personal consumption or sale\/barter in markets) and economic size.\nFormal or informal membership-based, collective action institution with the purpose of assembling and possessing established organizational structure to support members in pursuing their individual and collective interests. One essential function is to organize relations with the external world to mediate between members and others who act in their economic, institutional and political environment. This definition includes farmers\u2019 associations, farmer cooperatives, farmer clubs, farmer groups, producer organizations and women\u2019s groups.\nActions, strategies or activities undertaken by FOs to help small-scale producers\/smallholder farmers generate more income and have better access to food and other raw materials. Typical examples are agricultural extension, education, training and other ways to work with or for farmers.\nPositive or negative impacts of FO services on the environment. Positive impacts may include improved water quality, greater water availability, reduced erosion, reduced pollution, greater use of renewable energy, greater climate change resilience and lower vulnerability. Negative impacts could include water, soil and air pollution, deforestation and so on.\nChanges to the capabilities, assets (stores, resources, claims and access) and activities required for living.\nA livelihood that can cope with and recover from stresses and shocks, maintain or enhance its capabilities and assets, and provide livelihood opportunities for the next generation; it also contributes net benefits to other livelihoods at the local and global levels and in the short and long terms. In this scoping review, income and food security are the two most important components for measuring impacts on livelihoods.\nA search strategy was developed and tested by the authors to identify all available publications pertaining to the research question. Search terms included variations of the key concepts in the research question (that is FOs and the geographic regions of interest). Searches included the following electronic databases: CAB Abstracts and Global Health (accessed via Web of Science); Web of Science Core Collection (accessed via Web of Science); and Scopus (accessed via Elsevier). Full search strategies used for each database, including grey literature, can be accessed in their entirety athttps:\/\/osf.io\/4gt3b\/.\nIn addition to scholarly literature, the authors also conducted a comprehensive search of grey literature using custom web-scraping scripts. The authors tested search strings on each website before initiating web-scraping. An existing Google Chrome extension was needed to scrape dynamically generated websites. The authors combined and removed duplicated results from the databases and the grey literature searches using a Python script.\nA total of 239 studies were included in the review on the basis of the following inclusion criteria: (1) explicit reference to small-scale farmers, small-scale producers or smallholders; (2) explicit reference to farmer organizations, as defined in the protocol (https:\/\/osf.io\/4gt3b\/); (3) explicit reference to SSA, individual SSA countries or India; (4) published after the year 2000; (5) explicit reference to the impacts of FOs on livelihoods, including food security, income or the environment; (6) focus on agricultural production (crop or animal) for human and animal consumption; (7) no focus on stallholder activities in forestry, agroforestry, fisheries and aquaculture; (8) use of primary and secondary data to demonstrate contribution to outcomes; (9) published in English or French. The PRISMA flow diagram summarizes the study selection process and indicates the number of articles excluded at each phase of screening (Supplementary Fig.1.6). The data extraction template (available in theSupplementary Information) documented the study type and various aspects of FOs and their membership.\nStudies were selected following a three-stage process. The first stage involved title screening, a process where the main elements of each study are reviewed, such as the PICo components (participants, intervention and comparator, but not outcomes) that can help identify the corpus of relevant studies60. Title screening helped to considerably reduce the workload of citation screening while maintaining high recall of relevant studies60. In this study, manual title screening was enhanced by machine learning to accelerate the process. The machine learning model provided additional metadata about each study, including the identification of a study population and study geography. The additional metadata accelerated the speed with which title screening could be conducted. The second stage consisted of uploading the remaining articles to Covidence, a systematic review software package that performs title and abstract screening to exclude articles that did not meet the inclusion criteria. Two independent authors reviewed each title and abstract, and a third independent author resolved discrepancies. In the third stage, a single reviewer performed full-text screening of papers that met all inclusion criteria and those whose eligibility could not be established during title and abstract screening. Supplementary Fig.1.6presents the study selection process and indicates the number of articles excluded at each phase of screening. Some of the papers presented multiple studies such as ref.61covering two studies from Ethiopia, ref.62covering studies from Kenya and Uganda, ref.63covering India and Ethiopia, ref.64covering two studies from Kenya and ref.65covering two studies from India. Thus, the number of studies that this review refers to (n=\u2009239) exceeds the number of papers (N=\u2009234) included in the review. In addition, some of the included studies used aggregated household data that did not allow us to clearly separate FOs of the same type and that, in some cases, operate in adjacent locations and\/or belonged to the same umbrella organization. Because the studies often discuss services and impacts across the multiple FOs, we were not able to clearly separate these FOs in the studies; this could have led to underreporting of the total number of FOs that have been studied in the individual papers.\nA data extraction template for scoping reviews originally developed in ref.66was adapted for this scoping review. The data extraction template is available inSupplementary Data 1. Extracted data included all basic citation information and each study\u2019s location, design and methodology. We also extracted data about FOs in the studies, including their type and cost of membership, number of years in operation and focal activities of crops and livestock. These indicators were selected because of their reported potential influence on achieving impacts in the literature9,52,64. We also collected information about the services FOs provide to members, including marketing services, output marketing, market information, financial services, technology services such as education, extension, research, skills, technology access, infrastructure development and management, managing common property resources and others.\nThe impacts of FOs were separated into categories, detailing impacts of FOs services on livelihoods, agricultural production and the environment. As stated inBox 1, livelihood impacts include changes in income and food security. We also collected impacts that are often reported on the literature on FOs\u2019 impacts such as improvements in yield, production quality and empowerment67,68,69.\nGiven that SDG target 2.4 concerns the linkages between agricultural production and the environment, information about the impacts of FOs on the environment was also collected. The environmental impacts were identified as the outcomes of services primarily aimed at improving the benefits to members such as income, yield or production quality (for example through access to irrigation, improved grazing land or reduced impacts of climate change on production). Environmental impacts included resilience-building and responses to climate change such as flood protection and changes in water quality and quantity, soil characteristics and erosion, land in production\/set aside, biodiversity, the use of renewable energy sources\/reduced used of fossil fuel-based energy and others. To specify the impacts, we also collected any quantification noted in the studies such as percentage change in income, change in yield and production quality, percentage of change in land use and others. Similarly, we documented the presence or lack thereof any external and socio-demographic factors that could potentially influence the impacts of FO services.\nThe data extraction also included an assessment of the quality of the methodology used in each of the included papers. We examined whether sampling methods were clearly specified and whether the sampling strategy for both qualitative and quantitative studies were suitable\u2014in particular, if the sample selection was based on specific criteria to select the FOs\u2019 members and non-members of the FOs and if these criteria were explicitly listed in the study. Next, the studies were reviewed for their methodology justification based on the studies\u2019 research design, focusing on two criteria: if the methodology used control groups and\/or conducted pre- and post- assessments when assessing the FOs\u2019 benefits to the members. Finally, we assessed whether a clear description of the method and methods used for data analysis and its appropriateness to make sure reported FO\u2019s benefits to the members are based on data collected from the sample instead of for example based on literature. Based on these criteria, studies lacking clearly-stated methodological approaches and\/or deemed inadequate were classified as low quality (Supplementary Table1.1).\nWe synthesized data on FO services and their impacts on livelihood and the environment in the context of documented external and socio-demographic factors. Contextual details on the basic characteristics of FOs included in the studies, such as their geographical location, years of operation, membership type and fees can be found in Supplementary Figs.1.3and1.4.\nAll data are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.\nThe scripts used for literature screening\/selection and data analysis are available on request from the corresponding author.

Lack of education or skills training has been cited as a challenge to engage youth in the sector. Here we systematically interrogate the literature for the evaluation of skills training programmes for youth in low- and middle-income countries. Sixteen studies\u2014nine quantitative, four qualitative and three mixed methods\u2014from the research and grey literature documented the effects of programmes on outcomes relating to youth engagement, including job creation, income, productivity and entrepreneurship in agriculture. Although we find that skills training programmes report positive effects on our chosen outcomes, like previous systematic reviews we find the topic to chronically lack evaluation. Given the interest that donors and policymakers have in youth engagement in agriculture, our systematic review uncovers a gap in the knowledge of their effectiveness.\nYouth in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) disproportionately experience working poverty. In 2019, about 21% of employed youth in LMIC were living on less than US$2 a day, compared with 16% of the overall working population1. In sub-Saharan Africa, nearly 70% of working youth were found to be living in poverty; in South Asia, close to 50% were living in poverty2. Issues of youth unemployment and underemployment are linked to greater likelihood of future unemployment, decreased future job satisfaction, lower income and poorer health in adulthood3. National consequences include greater costs to support public programmes (such as public work programmes that provide temporary jobs) and indirect costs of lower earnings such as loss of investment in education4,5. Furthermore, youth underemployment is linked to disillusionment and the possibility of social unrest6.\nThe working-age population in LMIC is predicted to double in the next 35 years7and while this presents challenges, many LMIC are currently experiencing a demographic dividend phase where there is a high ratio of working-age population to dependents. This offers unique prospects for economic development with concomitant reductions in poverty and food insecurity. Addressing unemployment and underemployment is, therefore, a major policy priority for LMIC6, and a key sector for the creation of employment opportunities, especially in Africa and Asia, is agriculture6,8,9.\nMany people in LMIC rely on agriculture for their livelihoods (32% in 2019)10, either directly, as farmers, or indirectly in sectors that derive their existence from agricultural production8,9,11. Agricultural development is estimated to be up to 3.2 times more effective in alleviating poverty in low-income, resource-rich countries than any other sector12. Due to the close links between poverty and food insecurity13,14,15, agricultural development could also have positive consequences for the alleviation of hunger, particularly for women, as their empowerment in agriculture improves households\u2019 food security and nutrition16,17,18.\nHowever, there has been a declining trend of youth participation in agriculture since 2000, mainly in favour of the service sector6,19,20, which precipitates migration from rural to urban areas. Increased educational attainment for rural youth coupled with inability to rent or own land is a driver of urban migration21. In addition, the increasing ageing farmer population in rural areas exacerbates the demographic pressure on land at the expense of the youth22.\nA further constraint on youth engagement in agriculture is a lack of education in disciplines related to agriculture or skills training23,24,25. A study among Thailand\u2019s youth reported that 71% identified knowledge of farming practices as a pre-requisite to setting up a viable farm23. In rural Ethiopia, government initiatives to increase skills and productivity, and introduce improved and modern farming methods have generated interest among youth in joining the sector, and in Indonesia, vocational training was noted as increasing the likelihood of a successful career in agriculture26. A study in Zambia on rural youth aspirations, opinions and perceptions on agriculture documented high interest among youth in more productive forms of farming, such as the use of draught animals, electricity and the increased application of fertilizers24. Such findings challenge an assumption common in policy proposals that youth are not interested in agriculture25. Today, with the development of information and communication technology (ICT), young people have more opportunities to strengthen their skills and access relevant information and are therefore well positioned to understand market dynamics, and institutional and financial systems, enabling them to initiate and capitalize on processes of change in the agricultural sector27,28. Human capital theory predicts a positive correlation between human capital accumulation and labour productivity. On that basis, skills training can be used to improve agricultural employment outcomes29. Where governments and policy interventions support skills training for youth, there is a real possibility for entrepreneurship, a competitive economy and ultimately national growth. But, despite the implementation of skills training interventions, generally via youth employment programmes30, few specifically target agricultural skills training in LMIC and very little is known about the effectiveness of youth agricultural interventions30,31.\nHere we systematically review skills-based training interventions that aim to increase youth engagement in agricultural employment in LMIC to better inform investment decisions made by donors and policymakers. The interventions include agriculture-related courses, on-the-job training, technical or vocational education and training in agriculture, as well as general skills training including entrepreneurship, financial literacy and life skills for engagement in agriculture. The outcomes of interest we started out with were: employment along an agricultural value chain; employment in agribusiness; engagement in contract farming; development of agricultural entrepreneurship; agricultural business performance (productivity, profit, income, marketing rate); involvement in agricultural extension service provision. After data extraction, the outcomes of interest found in the selected studies are jobs created in the agricultural sector, self-employment and entrepreneurship, provision of and employment in extension services, profit\/income\/earnings from an agricultural activity or job, farm productivity, and the accessibility of employment opportunities in the sector. These outcomes pertain to the categories of jobs that can be found along the agricultural value chain.\nWe found among the studies yielded from the systematic literature search that skills training interventions reported employment in agriculture, agribusiness or agriculture-related activities, development of agricultural entrepreneurship, agricultural business performances (productivity, profit, income) and involvement in agricultural extension service provision for young participants.However, we also found a chronic lack of evaluation of the effectiveness of interventions designed to enhance agricultural opportunities and engagement for young people in LMIC, a finding previously shown31.\nSixteen studies were identified for review based on a priori inclusion and exclusion criteria (Fig.1) detailed in our Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocol, PRISMA-P (Supplementary Material1, summarized inMethodsand published on Open Science Framework,https:\/\/osf.io\/bhegq\/\/).\nInclusion criteria were youth as the target population; inclusion of one or more outcome of interest (employment along an agricultural value chain; employment in agribusiness; engagement in contract farming; development of agricultural entrepreneurship; agricultural business performance (productivity, profit, income, marketing rate); involvement in agricultural extension service provision); agriculture sector as field of study; skills training as an intervention; publication in English or French between 1990 and 2019; original research or review of existing research or institutional reports; targets low- and middle-income country or countries as area(s) of study (see list of World Bank country classifications (Supplementary Table1); a clear and well-accepted methodology (studies were excluded if there was no clear method on sampling, data analysis or discussion of results). Studies meeting the inclusion criteria and targeting mixed group (youth and other demographic groups) were also retained in the search strategy. A double-blind title and abstract screening were performed on 4,789 articles that were uploaded to systematic review software, Covidence, for title and abstract screening. Each article was reviewed by two independent reviewers and discrepancies were resolved by a third independent author within the team. After title and abstract screening, 261 articles remained. From title and abstract screening, 16 articles met a priori inclusion criteria.\nA data extraction template (Supplementary Table2) was used to document all information of interest from each of the 16 studies, overviewed in Table1.\nEleven of the studies were based in Africa32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42and five in Asia43,44,45,46,47. Twelve of the studies were published in peer-reviewed journals33,34,35,36,39,40,41,42,44,45,46,47and the rest originated from the grey literature, including one dissertation38, one report37and two working papers32,43.\nWith regard to the study design, nine of the included studies were quantitative32,33,34,35,36,37,43,44,45, four were qualitative41,42,46,47and three used mixed non-experimental38,39,40methods. Only one study used randomized control trial (RCT) as a study design method of evaluation32. Quasi-experimental impact methods (difference-in-differences (DID) and propensity score matching (PSM)) and quantitative non-experimental methods (statistical and econometric methods) were used in two33,43and six34,35,36,37,44,45studies, respectively. Nine of the included studies relied on survey data32,33,34,35,36,37,43,44,45, one study used data from interviews47, one study used data from focus groups42and the rest of the studies used mixed sources of data38,39,40(Supplementary Table3).\nTable2collates information from the selected studies on the basis of types of intervention and participant characteristics. Technical education\/training35,41,42,46and vocational training37,40,44,45constituted half of the interventions (four, each); youth programmes, agriculture-related courses and on-the-job training were identified as interventions in three33,34,38, two39,47and one36of the studies, respectively, and the remainder of the studies combined two types of intervention32,43. Twelve of the interventions were implemented through public policies33,34,35,37,38,39,41,42,43,44,45,47; non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and a mix of institutions (public and private) were each identified as implementers in two32,36and one46of the studies, respectively, and one study reported intervention implemented by an international institution40.\nNine of the studies solely targeted youth32,33,34,35,37,38,43,45,46, and seven targeted mixed groups of youth and others36,39,40,41,42,44,47. In fourteen studies, the participants were from all genders. In nine of the studies, participants were a mixed group of those already and not yet engaged in agriculture32,34,37,39,41,42,43,44,46; in five of the studies, participants were already engaged in agriculture before receiving skills training interventions35,36,37,45,47; there was not enough information to determine whether the participants were already engaged in agriculture in two studies33,40. Six of the studies indicated that the participants resided in rural areas33,34,35,36,46,47, while participants located in urban areas and in both rural and urban areas were identified in four32,38,40,45and five37,39,41,43,44of the studies, respectively; there was not enough information to determine the location of the participants in one42study. The population targeted in the studies was both educated and non-educated youth. Among the nine studies32,33,34,35,37,38,43,45,46that focused exclusively on youth, two targeted youth with a secondary education background34,46, one45targeted youth with a university background and six32,33,35,37,38,43of the studies targeted youth with a mixed educational background.\nWe evaluated the risk of bias of the included studies based on a previous approach48. The domains of risk retained are (1) the sampling technique used for the study, (2) the type of intervention, (3) the choice of the area of study, (4) the population targeted, (5) the method of data collection, (6) the method of data analysis, (7) the measurement of outcome and (8) the statistical significance of the effect. For each domain of risk, the criteria evaluated were defined and rated by their relevance for assessing the effectiveness of the interventions. Supplementary Table4summarizes the criteria of each domain of risk and its assessment and rating.\nUsing this scale, 15% of our included studies are at low risk of bias, 60% at moderate risk of bias and the remaining 25% at serious risk of bias. The outcome of the risk of bias assessment of the included studies in this systematic review is presented in Table3.\nThe risk of bias assessment process highlighted differences in focus, methods used and standards of evidence across the included studies. Weaknesses in study design, survey methods and method of evaluation of the impact of the interventions were common in most of the studies (with the exception of the studies ranked at low risk of bias), leading to weak results and limited generalizability.\nThe youth employment outcomes of interest to this systematic review are job creation, self-employment, engagement in entrepreneurship, provision of extension services, productivity of the farm\/agriculture-related activities, profits\/income, and job search or employment opportunity in agriculture-related activities. Here we elaborate on the study design and risk of bias of all studies, and highlight the effects on outcomes of interest for a selection of low and moderate risk studies.\nEight studies32,38,39,40,41,42,43,45looked at job creation in agriculture as an outcome. Among those studies, three are quantitative studies32,43,45, two are qualitative studies41,42and three are mixed-methods studies38,39,40.\nIn one quantitative study, deemed at low risk of bias (Table3), 1,700 workers and 1,500 firms were followed over four years to compare the effects of offering workers vocational training and offering firms wage subsidies to train workers on-the-job (firm training) in Uganda32. The results showed that both interventions allowed participants to acquire sector-specific skills and firm-specific skills leading to higher employment rates post-training for each type of worker, but the effect was greater for vocational training compared with firm training (21% versus 14% post-training employment rate) and their total earnings rose by more compared with the firm-training intervention (34% versus 20%). The qualitative studies41,42, although not designed to assess the effectiveness of an intervention, highlighted a link between skills training and employment outcome. However, both studies were deemed at serious risk of bias. A mixed-methods study38on youth programmes in Ghana showed that about 86.4% of young people still pursued maize farming a year after exiting the Youth in Agriculture Programme (YIAP). This public intervention was implemented to address youth unemployment in Ghana with the goal of getting young people to engage in the agricultural sector. The four main components of the programme were crops\/block farm, livestock and poultry, fisheries\/aquaculture, and agribusiness. The study focuses on evaluating the crops\/block farm component. The crops cultivated under the YIAP include maize (seed and grain), sorghum, soybean, tomato and onion. This study is ranked at moderate risk of bias.\nSix studies36,39,41,45,46,47indicated that skills training interventions resulted in self-employment in agriculture. Out of these studies, two studies are quantitative36,45, three are qualitative41,46,47and one is a mixed-methods study39.\nIn one quantitative study36, self-employment was stimulated by a skills training radio campaign on growing orange-fleshed sweet potatoes in Ghana, Tanzania, Burkina Faso and Uganda. A survey of the local communities where the radio campaign was run found that households that reported hearing the educational radio campaign in Ghana, Tanzania, Burkina Faso and Uganda were 8.9, 2.3, 1.7 and 1.1 times more likely, respectively, to engage in growing orange-fleshed sweet potatoes, than households that did not. This study is deemed at moderate risk of bias.\nFive studies34,38,39,41,42showed that skills training interventions encourage youth engagement or entrepreneurship in agriculture. Among these studies, one is quantitative34, two are qualitative41,42and two are mixed-methods studies38,39. In the quantitative study, a youth programme including agriculture content (training in livestock production, crop production and dairy farming) in South Africa indicated that youth engagement or self-employment in agriculture is eight times higher when agricultural programmes that specifically target the youth are implemented compared with when agricultural programmes are not available. This study is deemed at moderate risk of bias. Regarding the mixed-methods studies, one study38, deemed at moderate risk of bias with youth programme (YIAP in Ghana) as intervention, showed that after exiting the programme, 86.4% of beneficiaries were still involved in farming within a year. The qualitative studies were deemed at serious risk of bias.\nTwo studies35,41found that skills training interventions lead to higher productivity of the farms. One of the studies is quantitative35and the other is qualitative41. In the quantitative study, estimated to be at moderate risk of bias, the National Agricultural Extension and Research Liaison Services (NAERLS) rural youth extension programmes (RUYEP) helped 84.2% of beneficiaries achieve yields that exceed one tonne per hectare for maize in Nigeria, compared with 66% of non-participants35. The qualitative study41, outlined in Table1, is deemed at serious risk of bias.\nTen studies32,33,35,38,40,41,42,43,44,47looked at profit\/income earning of the farm as an outcome. Among those studies, five are quantitative32,33,35,43,44, three are qualitative41,42,47and two38,40are mixed-methoda studies. In one of the quantitative studies, the Training for Rural Economic Empowerment (TREE) programme increased beneficiaries\u2019 income by US$787 compared with non-beneficiaries over the 2011\u20132014 programme implementation period33. This study is deemed at low risk of bias. Another quantitative study44, deemed at moderate risk of bias, found that the continued adopters of beekeeping and mushroom growing had increased their family income by 49% and 24%, respectively. The three qualitative studies, not described here but outlined in Table1, are deemed at serious risk of bias41,42,47. The mixed-methods study40showed that the creation of a company that recycled livestock by-product (bone crafts and soap production) allowed vulnerable women and youths to earn an additional US$44.6 from bone crafts and US$50.2 from soap production weekly. This study is at moderate risk of bias.\nThree studies39,41,42investigated the effect of skills training on this outcome. One study is a mixed-methods design39and two41,42are qualitative. All of these studies, not described here but outlined in Table1, are deemed at serious risk of bias.\nOne study39investigated on the effects of skills interventions on provision of agricultural extension service and found that the majority of graduates who benefited from student\u2013farmer attachment and\/or the Supervised Student Enterprise Project (SSEP) were engaged in extension work. This study, outlined in Table1, is deemed at serious risk of bias.\nTwo studies39,47used agriculture-related courses as interventions.One of these studies is a mixed-methods study39and the other is qualitative47. The mixed-methods study investigated several outcomes in agriculture, namely, job creation, entrepreneurship, self-employment, provision of agricultural extension service and job search opportunity, which were found to improve with the skills training interventions. The interventions consisted of introducing innovations in agricultural training curricula (community engagement and agri-enterprise development) at Gulu University in Uganda. The community engagement took the form of a one year (or less) placement of undergraduate students to work with smallholder farmers and farmer groups within a 10\u2009km radius of the university. The agri-enterprise development consisted of having the students design business plans; the best plans were rewarded with start-up capital. The employment rate among the graduates was 84% six months after graduation and increased to 90% after one year; less than 2% of the graduates created their own businesses. The qualitative study47investigated two outcomes in agriculture, self-employment and income, which were found to increase after skills training on ready food mixes, maize products and mango products. The two studies are deemed to be at serious risk of bias.\nFour studies35,41,42,46used technical education\/training as interventions. Only one of these studies is quantitative35; the others are qualitative41,42,46. The quantitative study35investigated productivity and income of the farm, and found both to increase after the intervention. The NAERLS RUYEP objectives are to provide technical advisory services to boost agricultural production and raise living standards of the youth. The results showed that the intervention allowed 84.2% of beneficiaries to achieve yields that exceed one tonne per hectare for maize in Nigeria, compared with 66% of non-participants. This study is deemed at moderate risk of bias. Among the qualitative studies, one46looked at self-employment as an outcome and found a positive association with the intervention. The other two qualitative studies are deemed of serious risk of bias.\nYouth programmes are programmes that target youth and train them in either specific skills (agricultural skills, ICT skills and so on) or broad skills (decision-making skills, business skills and so on) to enhance their employability. These have been used as interventions in three studies33,34,38. One of these studies is mixed methods38and the two others are quantitative33,34. The mixed-methods study38investigated the following outcomes in agriculture: job creation, engagement and income; a positive association was found between youth programme and both engagement and income. The results showed that about 86.4% of young people still pursued maize farming one year after exiting the programme and the mean income of GH\u00a2758 obtained by beneficiaries was found to be greater than the national mean annual per capita income of GH\u00a2734. Among the two quantitative studies33,34, one investigated the income of beneficiaries33and the other34looked at engagement in agriculture; both found a positive effect of the intervention on their outcome. The study that investigated the income of beneficiaries as an outcome revealed that the TREE programme increased beneficiaries\u2019 income by US$787 compared with non-beneficiaries over the 2011\u20132014 programme implementation period33. In the other study34, a youth programme including agriculture content (training in livestock production, crop production and dairy farming) in South Africa indicated that youth engagement or self-employment in agriculture is eight times higher when agricultural programmes that specifically target the youth are implemented compared with when agricultural programmes are not available. Given that all three studies are at moderate or low risk of bias, we can conclude that the findings suggest that youth programmes have the potential to influence youth engagement in agriculture.\nOnly one study36looked at on-the-job training as an intervention. The outcome investigated is self-employment, on which the intervention had a positive effect. The results showed that households that reported listening to an educational radio campaign in Ghana, Tanzania, Burkina Faso and Uganda were 8.9, 2.3, 1.7 and 1.1 times more likely, respectively, to engage in growing orange-fleshed sweet potatoes, than households that did not. The study was deemed at moderate risk of bias.\nVocational training has been used as an intervention by four studies37,40,44,45. Among these studies, three are quantitative37,44,45and one is a mixed-methods study40. One quantitative study44investigated income as an outcome, on which positive effects of the intervention were found in India. The findings indicated that vocational training programmes have resulted in continued adoption of beekeeping and mushroom cultivation enterprises by 20% and 51% of trained farmers, respectively, and increased their family income by 49% and 24%, respectively. The second quantitative study investigated job creation and self-employment as outcomes and found positive links with the training45. The results of the study highlighted that vocational training in agriculture in Iran resulted in employment of more than half of graduates. The third quantitative study found a positive effect of the intervention on job creation, the sole outcome it had investigated37. The study showed that vocational training for a youth employment programme in Ghana resulted in the creation of 16,383 jobs in agribusiness. All four studies are deemed at moderate risk of bias (Table3); however, the use of descriptive methods in some of these studies preclude us from concluding that they are effective in improving employment outcomes for youth in the agricultural sector.\nOne study43investigated the combination of vocational training and technical training as an intervention. The outcomes investigated are job creation and income, on which the intervention had a positive effect. The study indicated that vocational training and technical training in agriculture (poultry technician) resulted in an increase in employment of 34.2% among the 41 beneficiaries who were trained as poultry technicians in Nepal. This study is deemed at low risk of bias, suggesting that combining vocational training and technical training may be a way of improving job prospects and income for youth in the agricultural sector.\nOne study32investigated the combination of vocational training and on-the-job training as an intervention. The outcomes investigated are job creation and earnings, on which the intervention had a positive effect. The results showed that both interventions allowed participants to acquire sector-specific skills and firm-specific skills, leading to higher employment rates post-training for vocational-trained workers compared with firm-trained workers (21% versus 14% post-training employment rate) and their total earnings rose by more compared with the firm-trained workers (34% versus 20%). This study is deemed at low risk of bias.\nTen studies out of the 16 overviewed in Table1presented information on the duration of training. Eight of these have programmes that last one year or less. The remaining studies indicated a training duration between two and five years. This suggests that training programmes predominantly have a relatively short-term duration, which is consistent with many interventions taking the form of technical and vocational education\/training. The popularity of technical and vocational\/education training as a model of intervention may be due to the relatively short-term nature of the training, or due to the nature of technical and vocational training, which is well suited for out-of-school youth, which are found in large numbers in LMIC49.\nIssues facing youth engagement in agriculture today are relatively well documented, including educational attainment, matrimonial status, gender, household size, parental income and occupation, membership in social organization, access to ICT, land tenure system and access to state-run agricultural youth programmes50,51,52. This present systematic review, which focused solely on interventions to engage youth in agriculture, yielded a limited set of studies\u2014nine quantitative, four qualitative and three mixed-methods studies\u2014so generalizable conclusions are difficult to draw. The risk of bias assessment yielded three studies32,33,43deemed at low risk of bias, nine studies34,35,36,37,38,40,44,45,46deemed at moderate risk of bias and four studies deemed at serious of risk bias39,41,42,47.\nThe results of our systematic review generally are in line with those found by the systematic review of Kluve et al.53on interventions to improve the labour market outcomes of youth. That systematic review of 107 interventions, including skills training, in 31 countries, found small positive effects for promoting entrepreneurship and skills training\u2014especially integrated skills training programmes\u2014but not for employment services and subsidized employment.\nOur systematic review also demonstrated that in general, skills interventions seeking to motivate youth\u2019s engagement in agriculture do not undergo a thorough evaluation for effectiveness, with hard outcomes related to employment. Our selected studies included case studies and qualitative methods, which are not adequate methods of evaluating impact and effectiveness of interventions. Only one study used an RCT32. The two studies relying on a quasi-experimental approach used DID and PSM methods33,43. Indeed, the results of the risk of bias assessment indicated the studies relying on RCT and quasi-experimental impact evaluation methods were at low risk of bias. However, these study designs are expensive to conduct. We found that of the studies that evaluate interventions, the majority did not use state-of-the-art impact evaluation methods. This has been corroborated by other studies30,31, showing a chronic lack of evaluation of interventions that aim to provide agricultural skills to youth.\nTraining on ICT is an important aspect for attracting and retaining youth in the agricultural sector46. ICT offers a method of delivering training to a large number of farmers, which could enhance the performance of the youth already in agriculture and attract new youth to the sector36. Radio campaigns have been shown to be effective in spurring adoption and consumption of orange-fleshed potatoes in Ghana, Tanzania, Burkina Faso and Uganda36. A study conducted in the Philippines found that ICT training helps motivate secondary school students whose parents are engaged in agriculture to work within the sector, especially when combined with offline activities such as exposure and hands-on experience as well as creative and motivational actitivites46.\nIt is important to note that heterogeneity in gender and education are not accounted for in the analysis of the impacts of education on youth participation in agriculture. Our systematic review revealed that most of the included studies failed to address the effectiveness of targeting the population of interest\u2014educated and uneducated youth. Illiteracy and gender heterogeneity were not addressed in the included studies. Indeed, no studies assessed the effects of training interventions on illiterate youth. This calls for investigations to focus on this vulnerable group of society, which represent about 25% of youth in sub-Saharan Africa and 11% in Southern Asia54. Failing to account for such variation in the background of the youth participants limits the ability to assess the effectiveness of skills training interventions.\nThe absence of robust research and lack of effective evaluation of the available data on the effectiveness of agricultural youth employment interventions has notable consequences on potential investment. Ultimately, the commitment of policymakers is necessary to ensure the sustainability and success of interventions to boost youth\u2019s engagement in agriculture. It is encouraging that the majority of interventions (12 studies out of 16) studied originated from public policy, compared with three originating from non-public policy programmes (NGOs, international institution) and one from mixed policies (public and non-public policies). However, to provide a compelling basis on which to convince governments and donors to fund future interventions, as well as encourage young people to partake in training, cost-effectiveness analysis and estimates of returns on investment in training programmes is necessary. Indeed, a 2018 stocktaking of the evidence on the effectiveness of youth employment interventions in Africa found that for the agricultural sector in particular, \u201cthere is very little literature and virtually no evaluation evidence to inform policymakers about what types of interventions can improve the prospects of young people in the [agricultural] sector\u201d31. Our study supports this conclusion. Moreover, to ensure that the skills training provides long-term opportunities for youth, it is crucial to establish a periodic follow-up to assess how trainees are performing after completion of a training programme. This aspect was missing in most of the interventions reviewed in this systematic review, yet it is important to check that the youth who engage in agriculture after receiving skills training are still involved and thrive in their agriculture-related business in the long term.\nIn summary, there is a need to foster youth skills training programmes and more importantly to evaluate more rigourously these programmes so that knowledge on good practices may be generated and transferred from one developing country to another. Estimates of returns to investment of agricultural skills training programmes are warranted as they could provide governments and donors with the evidence and cost-based analysis to continue and increase support for such programmes. Interventions also need to account for heterogeneity in gender and educational background of the youth to foster sustainability in agricultural value chains, inform inclusive policy design and ultimately contribute to reducing poverty and food insecurity in LMIC.\nThis systematic review was prepared following guidelines from Petticrew and Roberts55. The approach comprises five steps: identifying the research question; identifying relevant studies; study selection; extracting and charting the data; and collating, summarizing and reporting the results. The protocol for this study was registered on the Open Science Framework before study selection and can be accessed athttps:\/\/osf.io\/bhegq\/\/. The guiding question for this systematic review was: What are the effects of skills training interventions on educated and non-educated youth employment outcomes in agricultural value chains, agribusiness or contract farming in LMIC? The inclusion and exclusion criteria to identify and then select the relevant studies are shown in Table4.\nRegarding the risk of bias assessment, each study was assessed following the criteria of the eight domains of risk of bias we considered. The maximum score a study can obtain in terms of minimizing all domains of risk of bias is 23 stars, which is 100% of the stars. A study is deemed to be at low risk of bias across all domains if its total score is in the interval 75\u2013100%. If the total score is in the interval 50\u201375%, the study is said to be at moderate risk of bias across all domains. A study is at serious risk of bias if its score falls within the interval 25\u201350%. When the total score ranges from 0 to 25%, the study is deemed to be at critical risk of bias across all domains. See Supplementary Table4for details on the criteria used.\nAn exhaustive search strategy was developed and tested in CAB Abstracts to identify all available research pertaining to the effects of skills training interventions on educated and non-educated youth employment outcomes in agriculture in LMIC. Search terms were developed to address variations of the key concepts in the research question: skills training, youth, employment or engagement, and agriculture. Searches were performed on 9 May 2019 in the following electronic databases: CAB Abstracts (access via OVID); Web of Science Core Collection (access via Web of Science); EconLit (access via ProQuest); Agricola (access via OVID); and Scopus (access via Elsevier). Full search strategies for each database, including grey literature, can be accessed in their entirety athttps:\/\/osf.io\/xv56k\/.\nA comprehensive search of grey literature sources was also conducted. A list of the resources that were searched can be found athttps:\/\/osf.io\/xv56k\/. The grey literature searches were performed using custom web-scraping scripts. The search strings were tested per website before initiating web-scraping. An existing Google Chrome extension was needed to scrape dynamically generated websites.\nThe results from the databases and the grey literature searches were combined and de-duplicated using a Python script. Duplicates were detected using title, abstract and same year of publication, where year of publication was a match, where title cosine similarity was greater than 85%, and where abstracts cosine similarity was greater than 80% or one of the abstracts (or both) was empty. When duplicates were found, the results from the databases and the grey literature searches were combined and duplicates were removed.\nFollowing de-duplication, each citation was analysed using a machine-learning model. The model added more than 30 new metadata fields, such as identifying populations, geographies, interventions and outcomes of interest. This allowed for accelerated identification of potential articles for exclusion at the title\/abstract screening stage.\nSystematic review software, Covidence, was used for both title\/abstract and full-text screening decision-making with two independent reviewers evaluating each item. Citations were included in this study if they met all of the inclusion criteria noted above. Studies that did not meet all the inclusion criteria were excluded. Exclusion criteria were the inverse of the inclusion criteria. Each citation that met one of the exclusion criteria at the title, abstract or full-text screening phases were excluded. Studies included in the full-text screening stage were those that met all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria, or those whose eligibility could not be established during title\/abstract screening. Reasons for exclusion were documented at the full-text screening phase.\nThe retrieval of hundreds of PDFs for full-text screening was done with a combination of automated and manual methods. For the automated method, a Python script was created that would handle the tasks of PDF discovery, download and file renaming using Google Scholar. The script read the bibliographic data from an Excel spreadsheet and then executed a script to retrieve the full-text PDF. If the article is spotted in the search results, the download link is clicked, and the article will be auto-renamed and marked as being downloaded. Manual methods were employed for those items that were not retrieved using the script.\nA total of 245 records were identified for full-text screening. This screening process led to the identification of 16 studies that were considered adequate regarding the content and methodological rigour. The PRISMA flow diagram (Fig.1) shows the steps followed during the screening process and the number of items that resulted after each step.\nData extraction was based on interventions and outcomes established in the research question and exclusion criteria. The data extraction focused on the outcomes of the studies, the methods used to obtain the outcomes, and the validity and reliability of those methods using a data-extraction form. To reduce risk of bias related to the extracted data, two separate researchers extracted data from each included study in the full-text review step. When disagreements occurred between researchers on data extracted from a study, a third researcher was engaged to resolve conflict by extracting data again from the study and the results were compared with those found previously. In total, 31 conflicts were solved among the 261 reviews. The critical appraisal of individual sources of evidence gave an indication of the strength of evidence provided and informed the standards followed for this systematic review.\nFurther information on research design is available in theNature Research Reporting Summarylinked to this article.\nThe data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.\nThe code used in this study is available upon request.\nAn amendment to this paper has been published and can be accessed via a link at the top of the paper.\nWorld Employment and Social Outlook 2019: Trends for Youth(International Labour Office, 2019).\nWorld Youth Report: Youth and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development(United Nations, 2018);https:\/\/www.un.org\/development\/desa\/youth\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/21\/2018\/12\/WorldYouthReport-2030Agenda.pdf\nKilimani, N.
