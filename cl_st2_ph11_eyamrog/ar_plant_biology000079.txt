Plant diseases reduce crop yields and threaten global food security, making the selection of disease-resistant cultivars a major goal of crop breeding. Broad-spectrum resistance (BSR) is a desirable trait because it confers resistance against more than one pathogen species or against the majority of races or strains of the same pathogen. Many BSR genes have been cloned in plants and have been found to encode pattern recognition receptors, nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat receptors, and defense-signaling and pathogenesis-related proteins. In addition, the BSR genes that underlie quantitative trait loci, loss of susceptibility and nonhost resistance have been characterized. Here, we comprehensively review the advances made in the identification and characterization of BSR genes in various species and examine their application in crop breeding. We also discuss the challenges and their solutions for the use of BSR genes in the breeding of disease-resistant crops.
Plant diseases caused by pathogenic fungi, oomycetes, bacteria, viruses, and nematodes cause huge yield losses annually. A recent survey showed that crop losses caused by pathogens and pests worldwide range from 10.1% to 28.1% in wheat (Triticum aestivum), 24.6% to 40.9% in rice (Oryza sativa), 19.5% to 41.1% in maize (Zea mays), 8.1% to 21.0% in potato (Solanum tuberosum), and 11.0% to 32.4% in soybean (Glycine max) (157). In addition to reducing yields, plant diseases reduce crop quality and economic value and can cause food poisoning in humans and animals. The development of highly resistant cultivars is an economical and eco-friendly alternative to expensive and environmentally harmful chemical controls.
Broad-spectrum resistance (BSR) refers to resistance against more than one pathogen species or against most races or strains of the same species (80). Plant breeders have relied on the use of single dominant or recessiveresistance (R) genesbecause of their strong effects and ease of selection. MostRgenes confer race-specific resistance against a single or few pathogen strains; however, mutations and virulence shifts in pathogen populations make the effectiveness of these race-specificRgenes short-lived. In contrast to the high level of race-specific resistance conferred byRgenes, the partial resistance controlled byquantitative trait loci (QTLs)is usually race nonspecific. This partial resistance is generally insufficient to defend against pathogen attack, especially in epidemic years. Although combiningRgenes and QTLs in the same genetic background is effective for disease control, integrating both types of resistance in an elite cultivar is technically challenging and time consuming. For these reasons, the selection of new cultivars with BSR, which is usually durable (195), has become an important crop breeding goal. In this review, we classify BSR into species-nonspecific (SNS) BSR, which confers resistance against two or more pathogen species, and race-nonspecific (RNS) BSR, which confers resistance against two or more races or strains of the same pathogen (195).Supplemental Tables 1and2list the SNS- and RNS-BSR plant genes that have been cloned to date.
Plants use a two-tiered innate immune system to defend against pathogen infection. The first layer of defense is triggered by the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by membrane-associated pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), leading to PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI) (13). The second layer results from the recognition of pathogen avirulence (Avr) effectors by the nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat receptors (NLRs) and other types of cytoplasmic proteins and often leads to the robust, race-specific effector-triggered immunity (ETI) (71). Although PTI is generally weaker than ETI, the opposite situation has been observed in some cases, while in others, it is not easy to clearly distinguish PTI from ETI (182).
Rgenes encode surface receptors [such as receptor-like kinases (RLKs)] or intracellular receptors (such as NLRs) that can detect cognate pathogen effectors directly or indirectly. Several genes encoding cell wall–associated kinases (WAKs) are also involved in pathogen detection. The PTI and ETI pathways involve numerous defense-signaling genes, such as those encoding receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases (RLCKs), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), enzymes for epigenetic regulation and protein degradation, transcription factors (TFs), and other signaling molecules. In addition, pathogen infection induces the expression of many pathogenesis-related (PR) genes, resulting in the production of antimicrobial proteins such as defensins, proteases, protease inhibitors, or enzymes involved in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the accumulation of secondary metabolites for cell wall cross-linking and the deposition of lignin and callose as well as phytoalexins (6). Furthermore, many genes underlying QTLs, loss of susceptibility (S), and nonhost resistance (NHR) have recently been cloned and used in crop breeding (131). This review focuses on our current understanding of the structure and function of the BSR genes that have been cloned in plants, in addition to the strategies used to introduce these genes into crops.
PAMPs are generally important for microbial survival or fitness and are therefore evolutionarily conserved. Plants perceive the PAMPs via cell surface PRRs that quickly activate immune responses. Plant PRRs are plasma membrane–localized RLKs or receptor-like proteins (RLPs) (71). Five PRRs fromArabidopsis thaliana, rice, and potato have been reported to confer SNS BSR (Supplemental Table 1). The first RLK-PRR to be characterized, FLAGELLIN SENSING 2 (FLS2) inArabidopsis, confers SNS BSR against several genera of flagellated bacteria, includingPseudomonas(39a,152a), and heterologous expression ofFLS2in other plant species enhances their resistance against many bacterial species (152). The bacterial PAMP elf18, a conserved N-terminal epitope of the elongation factor (EF) Tu, is recognized by the RLK-PRR EF-TU RECEPTOR (EFR), which functions as an SNS-BSR protein to regulateArabidopsisresistance against different bacterial pathogens (84,86). The transgenic expression ofArabidopsis EFRinNicotiana benthamiana, tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), potato, rice andMedicago truncatulaactivates SNS BSR against several pathogenic bacteria (12,86,141,161).Xa21was the first RLK-PRRRgene to be cloned in crops and confers resistance against multiple strains of the rice bacterial blight pathogenXanthomonas oryzaepv.oryzae(Xoo) (168a,188b). Moreover, heterologous expression ofXa21in citrus (Citrussp.),Arabidopsis, and banana (Musasp.) conferred resistance against several bacterial pathogens (56,137,183). The Lysin motif-containing proteins LYP4 and LYP6 in rice are dual-role PRRs that sense bacterial peptidoglycan and fungal chitin, activating immunity against bacteria and fungi (100). In potato, the RLP-PRR elicitin response (ELR) recognizes extracellular elicitin, a conserved molecular pattern produced byPhytophthoraspecies, and mediates SNS BSR against multiple species of this oomycete (34). In addition to ELR, the RLP-PRR RLP23 inArabidopsiswas reported to form a tripartite complex with the LRR receptor kinases Suppressor Of BIR1-1 (SOBIR1) and BRI-associated kinase (BAK1) to regulate microbial protein Necrosis and ethylene-inducing peptide 1-like protein (NLP)-triggered immunity (4). The ectopic-expressed RLP23 in potato can recognize NLP and induce SNS BSR to oomycetePhytophthora infestansand fungusSclerotinia sclerotiorum. These results demonstrate that PRRs that recognize widespread microbial patterns might be particularly suited for engineering immunity in crop plants (4).
The first identified SNS-BSRNLR proteins are the linkedArabidopsisRESISTANCE TO RALSTONIA SOLANACEARUM1 (RRS1) and RESISTANCE TO PSEUDOMONAS SYRINGAE4 (RPS4) that function cooperatively as a dualR-gene system against bacterial and fungal pathogens (129). RPS4 works with RRS1 as a pair to trigger a hypersensitive reaction (HR) againstPseudomonas syringaecontaining AvrRps4. Apart from AvrRps4, RRS1/RPS4 also recognize the effector PopP2 fromRalstonia solanacearum(129). Moreover, both RRS1 and RPS4 are required for resistance against the fungal pathogenColletotrichum higginsianum, probably through recognizing an unknown effector (10,129). Recently, the NLR protein RECOGNITION OF XOPQ 1 (Roq1) inN. benthamianawas shown to recognize the effectors of two bacterial species. It physically interacts with HopQ1 fromPseudomonasas well as XopQ alleles from variousXanthomonasspecies in the presence of the resistance regulator Enhanced Disease Susceptibility 1 (EDS1) (160). N REQUIREMENT GENE 1 (NRG1) was recently found to be a key protein acting downstream of EDS1 to mediate various Toll/IL-1 receptor-NLR signaling pathways, including those contributing to theRoq1-mediated resistance toXanthomonasandPseudomonasand toXopQ-regulated transcriptional changes inN. benthamiana(146). The mechanism of SNS BSR mediated by RRS1/RPS4 and Roq1 warrants further investigation.
Following the perception ofPAMPsor effectors, the PRRs or NLRs (or other R proteins) activate complex, interconnected signaling pathways that are involved in many biological processes, including protein–protein interactions, posttranslational modifications, epigenetic regulation, transcriptional regulation, and calcium ion signaling. The defense-signaling genes play positive or negative roles in these signaling processes. A total of 42 defense-signaling genes are known to be involved inSNS BSR(listed inSupplemental Table 1).
MAPKs are well-known defense-signaling proteins that transduce defense signals from the immune receptors to the downstream proteins; for example, OsMAPK5 negatively regulates rice resistance against both the bacterial pathogenBurkholderia glumaeand the fungusMagnaporthe oryzae(198). Similarly, OsMPK15 negatively regulatesPRgene expression and ROS accumulation, with theosmpk15knockout mutant having enhanced SNS BSR againstXooand multipleM. oryzaestrains (57). In addition, two MAPK cascade components in soybean, GmMPK4 and GmMEKK1, negatively regulate plant cell death,PRgene expression, the accumulation of salicylic acid (SA) and ROS, and resistance against multiple species of pathogens (105,200).
In addition to the MAPKs, other types of kinases, such as the RLKs and RLCKs, also function as SNS-BSR proteins (Supplemental Table 1); for example, overexpression of the RLCK-likeBROAD-SPECTRUM RESISTANCE 1(BSR1) gene confers BSR against at least two major bacterial species and two major fungal species in rice (115). Two riceWAKs, OsWAK25 and OsWAK91, are important for SNS BSR against two different pathogens (3,30,49).
Protein ubiquitination-mediated degradation also plays an important role in SNS BSR (24). The rice U-box E3 geneSPOTTED LEAF 11(Spl11) encodes a negative regulator of cell death, and thespl11mutant has increased SNS BSR againstM. oryzaeandXoo(212). The knockout of the gene encoding the SPL11-interacting Protein 6 (SPIN6) also increases plant resistance against these two pathogens (104). Another multisubunit E3 ubiquitin ligase, Cullin3a (OsCUL3a), negatively regulates rice cell death and SNR BSR againstM. oryzaeandXooby targeting and degrading NONEXPRESSER OF PATHOGENESIS-RELATED 1 (OsNPR1) (107). OsBAG4, the rice homolog of human BAG (Bcl2-associated athanogene), forms a module with the RING domain E3 ubiquitin ligase Enhanced Blight and blast Resistance 1 (EBR1) to control programmed cell death and SNS BSR againstM. oryzaeandXoo(207).
Proteins functioning in epigenetic modification appear to be key regulators of SNS BSR; for example, silencingHISTONE H4 DEACETYLASE GENE 701(HDT701) in rice enhanced resistance againstM. oryzaeandXoo(33). These results demonstrate that genes involved in protein degradation or epigenetic modification make important contributions to SNS BSR.
TFs are critical components of plant immune signaling and key regulators of defense-related gene expression. Several WRKY TFs are involved in SNS BSR in rice; for example, the overexpression ofOsWRKY45-1orOsWRKY45-2activated the defense response againstM. oryzaebut suppressed the response againstRhizoctonia solani(163,181). Furthermore, these two genes play opposite roles in rice–bacterium interactions:OsWRKY45-1negatively regulates rice resistance againstXooandX. oryzaepv.oryzicola(Xoc), butOsWRKY45-2positively regulates rice resistance againstXooandXoc(163,181). In addition,OsWRKY67,OsWRKY30,OsWRKY62, andOsWRKY76function as SNS BSR genes in rice (102,140,186). In cucumber (Cucumis sativus), the ethylene response factor TF geneCsERF004positively regulates the expression of severalPRgenes, the levels of the defense hormones, and the levels of SA and ethylene, and the overexpression of this gene confers SNS BSR againstCorynespora cassiicolaandPseudoperonospora cubensis(101).
As a central defense-signaling protein, NPR1 and its homologs NPR3 and NPR4 are SA receptors that activate SA-mediated systemic acquired resistance by transcriptionally activating defense genes inArabidopsis(18,41,215).NPR1overexpression confers SNS BSR against the bacterial pathogenP. syringaeand the oomycete pathogenPhytophthora parasiticain a dosage-dependent manner.The heterologous expression ofArabidopsis NPR1or its orthologs induces SNS BSR in many other plant species (165); for example, the expression ofNPR1in rice increases resistance againstXoo,M. oryzae,Fusarium verticillioides, andErwinia chrysanthemi(25,150). However, it is worth noting thatNPR1overexpression often leads to autoimmunity and pleiotropic phenotypes in transgenic plants.
The dynamic and robust transduction of defense signaling during the early stages of infection by many different pathogens leads to the rapid production of defense enzymes, defensins, thaumatin-like proteins, and secondary metabolites including phytoalexins. It also leads to the generation of ROS, callose deposition and cell wall modifications, and/or the activation of programmed cell death in plants in an attempt to inhibit pathogen infection. The production of these antimicrobial agents is regulated by thePRgenes, which are ubiquitous in plants and effective against a variety of pathogens. Three types ofPRgenes that contribute to SNS BSR are listed inSupplemental Table 1. SNS BSR of thesePRgenes is usually achieved by overexpressing them in transgenic plants. For example, the overexpression of the pepper geneCapsicum annuum ANTIMICROBIAL PROTEIN1(CaAMP1) inArabidopsisincreased resistance against various pathogens (89). Moreover, the overexpression of the motherwort (Leonurus japonicus) geneLjAMP2, encoding an antimicrobial protein, in white poplar (Populus tomentosa) conferred SNS BSR against multiple fungal pathogens (64,204a).
Phytohormone synthesis–related proteins such as the rice ethylene biosynthesis enzyme 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase 2 (OsACS2) also function in BSR. The overexpression ofOsACS2enhances ethylene production, defense gene expression, and resistance to a field isolate ofR. solaniand multiple strains ofM. oryzae(53). Interestingly, there is little or no difference betweenOsACS2overexpression plants and the wild-type plants in agronomic traits, which is ideal for rice resistance breeding. In addition, a rice homologue of mammalian selenium-binding proteins,OsSBP, also functions as a BSRPRgene (158). OsSBP positively regulates rice defense gene transcription and phytoalexin accumulation afterM. oryzaeinfection and H2O2accumulation after treatment by the protein phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A. As a result, overexpression ofOsSBPactivates rice disease resistance againstXooandM. oryzae(158).
Plant genes that facilitate pathogen infection and contribute to susceptibility are termedSusceptibility (S) genes(210). Loss-of-function mutations inSgenes (recessive alleles) substantially reduce the compatibility between hosts and pathogens and thus result in resistance against a diverse array of pathogens. TheSgenes are usually targeted and induced by pathogens to negatively regulate host resistance. Over the past two decades, 11Sgenes affecting SNSBSRhave been identified in crops (Supplemental Table 1). For example,Xa5, encoding a γ-subunit of the TF IIA, was the firstSgene to be identified in rice and was found to negatively regulate SNS BSR against multiple isolates ofXoo(66) andXoc(209).Xa13/OsSWEET11encodes a sugar transporter that facilitates bacterial and fungal infections, and the loss of its function confers SNS BSR againstXooandR. solani. A recent study reported that CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutations in the promoters ofOsSWEET11and its homologsOsSWEET13andOsSWEET14provide BSR to all testedXoostrains collected in Asia and Africa (136). In addition, the team reported the development of a diagnostic kit, SWEETRkit 1.0, to detect induction ofOsSWEET11,OsSWEET13andOsSWEET14in the engineered reporter rice lines to visualize SWEET protein accumulation and identify suitable resistant lines for farmers (26,36,44).
Recently,BROAD-SPECTRUM RESISTANCE KITAAKE-1(Bsr-k1) was cloned in rice and was found to encode a tetratricopeptide repeat domain RNA-binding protein that negatively regulatesSNS BSR.Bsr-k1knockout resulted in the upregulated expression of the rice phenylalanine ammonia lyase genes (OsPALs) and enhanced resistance againstM. oryzaeandXoo(220). Similarly, the tomatoeukaryotic translation initiation factorgeneselF4E1andelF4E2function asSgenes that negatively regulate SNS BSR (120). The knockdown of both genes activates tomato resistance against many potyviruses, includingPotato virus Y,Tobacco etch potyvirus,Pepper mottle virus,Ecuadorian rocoto virus, andPepper severe mosaic virus(120).
TheArabidopsisprotein Downy Mildew Resistant 6 (DMR6) belongs to a superfamily of 2-oxoglutarate Fe(II)-dependent oxygenases, and its production is enhanced in response to pathogen infection (185). The knockout ofDMR6enhances the expression of defense-related genes and increases SA levels, resulting in SNS BSR against many bacterial, fungal, and oomycete pathogens (135,185,211). Similarly, the knockout of the genesSPOTTED LEAF 28(SPL28, encoding a clathrin-associated adaptor protein),ABSCISIC ACID2(OsABA2, alcohol dehydrogenase),OsPLDβ1(phospholipase D),Suppressor of Salicylate Insensitivity of npr1–5(OsSSI2,stearoyl acyl carrier protein fatty acid desaturase), andOsDRP1E(dynamin-related protein) in rice resulted in SNS BSR againstM. oryzaeandXoo, although all the mutants underwent cell death (65,96,97,148,201).
Compared with the major gene-mediated resistance, quantitative resistance controlled byQTLsis usually thought to be race nonspecific and more durable. To date, four QTLs contributing to SNS BSR have been cloned in wheat, maize, and cucumber (Supplemental Table 1). The genesLr67/Yr46andLr34/Yr18/Pm38, cloned in wheat, confer SNS BSR against important diseases.Lr67/Yr46encodes a hexose transporter that confers partial resistance against multiple pathogens, including pathogens that cause leaf rust, stripe rust, stem rust, and powdery mildew in wheat (54,123a,169). The transporter encoded byLr67/Yr46is believed to modulate hexose transport in the infected leaves, thereby reducing the growth of multiple species of biotrophic pathogens. Similarly,Lr34/Yr18/Pm38encodes an ATP-binding cassette transporter that confers partial resistance against leaf rust, stripe rust, and powdery mildew in wheat (82,87,169).
The maize QTLqMdr9.02confers resistance against important diseases, including southern leaf blight, gray leaf spot, and northern leaf blight. Molecular cloning revealed thatZmCCoAOMT2, which encodes a caffeoyl-CoAO-methyltransferase, contributes to theqMdr9.02-mediated quantitative resistance against southern leaf blight and gray leaf spot (204), indicating that ZmCCoAOMT2 may control metabolite levels in the phenylpropanoid and lipoxygenase pathways associated with SNS BSR in maize.
The cucumber resistance QTLSTAYGREEN(CsSGR), used for over 50 years to confer SNS BSR against oomycete downy mildew, bacterial angular leaf spot, and fungal anthracnose pathogens, was recently cloned (192). A single-nucleotide polymorphism was found to cause an amino acid substitution in CsSGR, resulting in the inhibition of chlorophyll degradation (and thus a stay-green phenotype) upon pathogen infection, which may inhibit the overaccumulation of ROS and phytotoxic catabolites in the plants.SGRis highly conserved in plants; however, its resistance function has not previously been reported in other species.
NHRis the most common form of disease resistance exhibited by plants against the majority of potentially pathogenic microorganisms (128). It is believed to confer long-lasting BSR and helps ensure plant survival (52). The firstNHRgene to be isolated wasNONHOST 1(NHO1) inArabidopsis, which positively regulates SNS BSR against several nonhost pathogens, such as the bacteriaP. syringaepv.tabaci, P. syringaepv.phaseolicola, andPseudomonas fluorescensand the fungusBotrytis cinerea(72,113). ThreeNHRgenes related to pathogen penetration were isolated in genetic screens ofArabidopsis.PENETRATION1(PEN1) encodes a syntaxin that localizes to the plasma membrane, and its role in vesicle trafficking and exocytosis appears to confer NHR to the powdery mildew pathogensBlumeria graminisf. sp.hordei(Bgh) andErysiphe pisi(8,27,99).PEN2, which encodes a glycosyl hydrolase that localizes to peroxisomes, positively regulates BSR against the host-specific pathogenErysiphe cichoracearumand the host-nonspecific pathogensBghandE. pisi(99,171).PEN3is a plasma membrane–localized putative ATP-binding cassette transporter that not only positively regulates plant resistance against many host-nonspecific pathogens but also negatively regulates host resistance againstE. cichoracearumin an SA-dependent manner (111,171).
Nearly all clonedNLRRgenes in plants confer resistance against a single pathogen; however, as indicated inSupplemental Table 2, 36 NLRRgenes conferRNS BSRin rice, wheat, potato, tomato, pepper, and roses (Rosaspp., multiple cultivars). Among the cloned rice blastRgenes, 12 were reported to confer RNS BSR, and all these exceptPtrencode NLR proteins (Supplemental Table 2). ThePi2/Pi9locus on rice chromosome 6 contains several RNS-BSR genes, includingPi2,Pi9,Pi50,Piz-t, andPigm(109). ThePigmlocus is unique in that it encodes a pair of antagonistic NLRs, Pigm Resistant (PigmR) and Pigm Susceptible (PigmS) (31); PigmR confers BSR, while PigmS competitively forms heterodimers with PigmR to inhibit its function in immunity. However,PigmSexpression is tightly controlled by epigenetic regulation, resulting in strong and durable blast resistance without a yield penalty.Pi2,Pi9,Pi50,Piz-t, andPigmhave been widely used in the breeding of blast-resistant rice. In wheat, three leaf rustRgenes (Lr1,Lr10, andLr21), five stem rustRgenes (Sr33,Sr35,Sr22,Sr45, andSr50), one yellow rustRgene (Yr5/Yr7), and one powdery mildewRgene (Pm21) confer RNS BSR, and all these genes encode NLR proteins (Supplemental Table 2).
Nine RNS-BSRRgenes encode non-NLR proteins (Supplemental Table 2); for example, the rice geneXa4encodes aWAKprotein and confers durable RNS BSR againstXoowithout compromising grain yield (58). In noninoculated plants, XA4 activates the transcription of the cellulose synthase geneCesAto facilitate cellulose biosynthesis and inhibits expansin expression, increasing the mechanical strength of the plant cell wall and suppressingXooinfection (58). The rice genesXa10,Xa23, andXa27encode executor R proteins and confer durable RNS BSR at the seedling and adult stages (48a,188a,213). In addition, the yellow rustRgenesYr15andYr36in wheat encode a tandem kinase and a START kinase, respectively (40,77).
The ubiquitination-mediated pathway plays important roles in RNS BSR by activating the NLRs and downstream immune signaling (24). Three defense-signaling genes encode E3 ligases in rice and potato (Supplemental Table 2). The rice RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligase BLAST AND BTH-INDUCED 1 (OsBBI1) was reported to regulate RNS BSR againstM. oryzaeby modifying the host cell wall (93). The overexpression ofOsBBI1increased rice resistance against multiple strains ofM.oryzaeand enhanced accumulation of defense-associated H2O2and other ROS. The rice U-box/ARM E3 ubiquitin ligase OsPUB15 interacts with the rice blast R protein Pid2 to positively regulate plant cell death and the basal defense response, thereby conferring RNS BSR againstM. oryzae(189). The RING-H2 Finger Protein 1 (StRFP1) is a potato E3 ubiquitin ligase that positively regulates RNS BSR against multiple strains ofPhytophthora infestansin potato and in transgenicN.benthamianavia an E3 ligase activity-dependent pathway (133,218).
Protein kinase genes are also involved in RNS BSR in crops (Supplemental Table 2). The rice RLK Blast Resistance-Related 1 (OsBRR1) positively regulates resistance againstM. oryzae, withOsBRR1-overexpressing plants exhibiting enhanced resistance against virulentM. oryzaeisolates without showing obvious developmental changes (139). The L-type lectin receptor kinase V (LecRK-V) was cloned from the diploid wheat relativeHaynaldia villosa, and its transgenic expression in wheat enhances powdery mildew resistance at the seedling and adult stages (194).Stpk-V, a serine/threonine protein kinase gene also fromH. villosa, confers BSR against wheat powdery mildew (147). Most recently, we discovered a novel plant RNA recognition motif domain–containing TF family that physically interacts with rice NLRs to trigger RNS-BSR blast resistance, which directly activates rice defense genes includingOsWAK14andOsPAL1, establishing a direct link between transcriptional activation of immune responses with NLR-mediated pathogen perception (214).
To date, fiveSgeneshave been reported to confer RNS BSR (Supplemental Table 2).Mildew Resistance Locus O(Mlo) was the firstSgene to be identified in barley (Hordeum vulgare), but it has also been found in almost all higher plants (17). Recessivemloloss-of-function alleles of barley induced by ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS), X-rays, or γ rays confer durable RNS BSR to all known isolates ofBgh(17). MLO localizes to the plasma membrane and contains seven conserved transmembrane domains and a calmodulin-binding domain in its C terminus (75). In wild-type barley, MLO suppresses the hydrogen peroxide burst in the epidermal cell wall at theBghpenetration site, thus inhibiting disease resistance by suppressing plant cell death and a second oxidative burst (142). The effectiveness and durability of the barleymlogene to powdery mildew led to the identification and functional characterization of manyMLOorthologs in other plant species, such asArabidopsis AtMLO2,AtMLO6, andAtMLO12; tomatoSlMLO1; peaEr1/PsMLO1; grapevineVvMLO3andVvMLO4; tobaccoNtMLO1; pepperCaMLO2; cucumberCsaMLO8;Lotus japonicus LjMLO1; barrel cloverMtMLO1; riceOsMLO3; and wheatTaMLO-A1,TaMLO-B1, andTaMLO-D1(217). The functions of these orthologous genes in disease resistance remain to be elucidated.
The riceSgenePi21(also referred to as aQTL) encodes a proline-rich protein with a putative heavy metal–binding domain and a protein–protein interaction domain (42). Thepi21recessive allele containing mutations in its proline-rich motif confers durable RNS BSR against manyM. oryzaestrains and has been used in rice breeding in Japan for many years (42). Another rice blast RNS-BSRSgene,Broad-spectrum resistance Digu 1 (Bsr-d1), was recently cloned and reported to encode a C2H2-type TF (94). A single-nucleotide change in the promoter ofBsr-d1enhances the binding of the MYB TF MYBS1, which suppressesBsr-d1expression and enhances resistance against multiple strains ofM. oryzae(94). SeveralSgenes also function in the rice-Xoopathosystem, includingXa25/OsSWEET13andXa41(t)/OsSWEET14, which encode sugar transporters that facilitate bacterial infection, reducing RNS BSR againstXoo(62,219).
Three RNS-BSR QTLs have been cloned in wheat, maize, and potato (Supplemental Table 2). Recently, the long-sought wheat QTLFhb1, which confers durableRNS BSRagainstFusariumhead blight, was cloned and characterized by three independent research groups and was found to likely encode a putative histidine-rich calcium-binding protein (5,91,174) or a chimeric lectin with agglutinin domains and a pore-forming toxin-like domain (151). BecauseFhb1is highly conserved in the genomes of grass species, the identification ofFhb1is significant for the breeding of cereal crops resistant toFusariumspecies. The maize RNS-BSR geneHelminthosporium turcicum resistance N1(Htn1) protects against northern corn leaf blight and was found to encode a WAK (ZmWAK-RLK) with a highly diverse extracellular domain in different maize genotypes (60). The potato QTLR8encodes an NLR, which contributes to providing durable BSR against late blight (70). The further characterization of these genes will elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying QTL-mediated resistance.
Breeding resistant cultivars usingRgenesis currently the most effective and economical strategy for controlling crop diseases (126); however, the frequent loss ofRgene–mediated resistance in the field limits the widespread and long-lasting use of singleRgenes in breeding programs.PyramidingmultipleRgenes, especially BSR genes, with different resistance spectra against a single pathogen or multiple pathogens in the same genetic background has proved to be an effective strategy for achieving BSR. With the use ofmarker-assisted selection (MAS), multipleRgenes have been successfully pyramided into recipient cultivars of various crops to generate new varieties with resistance against several major diseases, including rice blast, rice bacterial blight, wheat rust, wheat powdery mildew, and soybean cyst nematodes.
Rice blast and bacterial blight are the two most important diseases of rice (109). Rice lines containing multiple pyramidedRgenes usually have broader resistance than lines containing singleRgenes; for example, the resistance spectra and levels in lines containingPi2/Pi1,Pigm/Pi54,Pi2/Pi54, andPiz-t/Pi54pairs were significantly better than the monogenic lines containing individualRgenes (67,196,197). Similarly, elite rice varieties with pyramidedXa4,Xa21,Xa7,Xa23, andXa27genes obtained using MAS have broader resistance spectra and higher resistance levels than lines containing only a single gene (114,176,202). Efforts to integrate multipleRgenes that confer BSR against different pathogens in elite rice cultivars have recently been increased, as exemplified by the development of lines containingPi9andXa23,Pi2andXa23, orXa21andPi54(68,132,178).
Wheat fungal diseases cause annual yield losses of 15–20% (39). Over 187Rgenes in wheat have been found to confer resistance against various rust diseases, and many have been used in breeding for rust resistance (2). TheRgenesSr22,Sr25,Sr26,Sr33,Sr35,Sr45, andSr50are considered to be the most valuable for pyramiding to protect against the newly evolved races of stem rust, including the aggressive race Ug99 (35,166). Pyramiding of two single dominant yellow rust genes,Yr5andYr15orYr64andYr15, in common wheat resulted in complete resistance against all tested stripe rust races (77,149). In addition, different combinations of the powdery mildewRgenesPm2,Pm4a, andPm21were successfully integrated into the elite wheat cultivar Yang 158, resulting in broad-spectrum powdery mildew resistance (103).
The soybean cyst nematode (Heterodera glycines) has a major effect on soybean production (108).Resistance to Heterodera glycines 1(Rhg1) is located in a cluster with genes encoding an amino acid transporter, an α-soluble NSF (N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor) attachment protein, and a wound-inducible domain protein 12 (WI12), each of which contributes to providing resistance against the cyst nematode (28). The major resistance QTLRhg4that encodes a serine hydroxy-methyltransferase was also cloned (108). A strong epistatic interaction occurs betweenRhg1andRhg4in the Peking background, which provides the only known instance of full resistance against the pathogenic nematode (122); therefore, lines containing these two genes have a broader spectrum of resistance against the cyst nematode (208). Similarly, potato plants containing stacks of two or three of theRgenesRpi-vnt1,Rpi-sto1,Rpi-vnt1.1, andRpi-blb3exhibit BSR against the late blightP. infestansin the field (51,221).
As mentioned above, the pyramiding ofRgenes with complementary resistance spectra or modes of action can produce additive and synergistic effects on resistance levels and spectrum. In a few cases, however, the pyramiding ofRgenes can reduce resistance to levels lower than what could be obtained with individualRgenes. In the case of blast disease in rice, for example, the resistance level of plants containingPiz-5andPitais lower than the level observed in the monogenic lines expressingPiz-5alone (55). Similar phenotypes were also observed in the pyramiding lines containingPizandPi54(196); therefore, differentRgene combinations should be tested for their compatibility in different genetic backgrounds before they are used in breeding programs.
It has been well documented that a combination ofRgenes andQTLsor partial resistance genes confersdurable resistance(127,131). Plant breeders have pyramidedRgenes with multiple QTLs to achieve broad-spectrum and durable resistance and to reduce the selection of resistance-breaking pathogen genotypes (88,170). In wheat, the best-known QTL genes areSr2,Lr34,Lr46, andLr67; these genes have provided partial resistance in mature plants for many years over large areas, despite high and prolonged disease pressure in the field (35). CombiningLr34andLr67with various dominant race-specificLrgenes enhanced the resistance of wheat plants against leaf rust in multiyear, multilocation field trials (29,46,184). The pyramiding ofRgenes with QTLs, such as the combination ofSr2,Lr34/Yr18/Pm38, andLr46/Yr29/Pm39, has proved effective for the control of stripe rust and powdery mildew in the CIMMYT spring wheat breeding programs (98,167). The QTLFhb1has been widely deployed to improveFusariumhead blight resistance in different cultivated wheat varieties (91,151,174,205), and the pyramiding ofFhb1with the leaf rustRgeneLr21in elite spring wheat greatly improved itsBSRagainst various pathogens (168).
Several maize disease QTLs have been cloned, includingqHSR1,Htn1,qMdr9.02, andZmTrxh(203,204). Resistance alleles from multiple QTLs have been stacked into a single line using MAS, resulting in BSR against multiple pathogens (7,216). The pyramiding of theRgenesHt1andHt2with a head smut QTL provided a higher level of disease resistance against northern leaf blight and head smut than was observed in the parental lines (69). In addition, two studies showed that rice lines with multiple blast-resistance QTLs, includingpi21,qBR4-2,Pi34,qBR12-1, andPi35, had a strong, race-nonspecific, environmentally stable resistance againstM. oryzae(43,206). Integration of these resistance QTL alleles into elite cultivars with majorRgenes will likely lead to the development of durable BSR rice lines.
PlantRgene expression is typically strictly controlled to avoid autoimmunity when plants are not under pathogen attack (95); however, the overexpression of a fewRgenes can activate immune responses and generate BSR against multiple pathogens without inducing high levels of cell death. For example, increasing expression of the riceRgeneXa3/Xa26using different promoters, including the native,WRKY13, and maizeUbiquitinpromoters, can increase the spectrum ofXooresistance (19). In addition, overexpression of the ricePRRsOsLYP4andOsLYP6conferred BSR againstXooandM.oryzae(100). Similarly, overexpression of thePtogene in tomato conferred resistance againstP. syringaepv.tomato,Xanthomonas campestrispv.vesicatoria, andCladosporium fulvum(180).
Modification of the transcription activator-like effector (TALE)-binding sites inRgenes can generate broad, durable resistance against importantXanthomonasdiseases (59,153). The introduction of multiple TALE-binding elements into the promoter of theRgeneXa27activates its expression and expands resistance againstXooandXoc(59). The designer TALEs strategy uses the scaffold of the TALE AvrBs3 and modified repeat-variable diresidues that match the tomatoBacterial spot resistance 4(Bs4),Arabidopsis ENHANCER OF GLABRA3(EGL3), or theArabidopsis KNOTTED-LIKE 1(KNAT1) promoters to transcriptionally activate them in a sequence-specific manner (124). Engineering synthetic TALEs to induce the transcription of these immune receptor–encodingRgenes can therefore trigger BSR against various pathogens.
Recently, significant progress has been made in engineering sensitizedNLRvariants with a lower activation threshold, which recognize a wider spectrum of effectors. Mutations in the conserved coiled-coil and nucleotide-binding domains of the NLR receptors expanded their response spectra to include more effector variants (21,50,162,173). Another study (47) reported that the engineered tomato immune receptor I2 (I141N) confers partial resistance againstP. infestansand has an expanded response spectrum to the fungusFusarium oxysporumf. sp.lycopersici, suggesting that synthetic immune receptors can be engineered to confer resistance against phylogenetically divergent pathogens. Mutations in the LRR domain and near the nucleotide-binding pocket structure of the NLR receptors Rx and R3a may increase the resistance spectrum (37,50,162). These studies illustrate that immune receptors can be modified to improve the NLR resistance spectra. It remains to be determined how base-editing technologies could be used to generate point mutations at conserved NLR nucleotides to obtain new BSR genes (45).
Another significant breakthrough was made in modifying a decoy to engineer novel pathogen recognition specificities (81). TheArabidopsisNLR receptor RESISTANCE TO PSEUDOMONAS SYRINGAE5 (RPS5) guards the host kinase AVRPPHB SUSCEPTIBLE1 (PBS1) against cleavage by the bacterial effector AvrPphB, a protease that cleaves PBS1 at a defined region to produce a conformational change. The engineered modification of the AvrPphB cleavage site within PBS1 to resemble that of a bacterial or viral protease enabled RPS5 to recognize these proteases upon infection (76). This study indicates that decoys can be used to expand the recognition specificity of a plant NLR, an approach with potential use in the rational engineering of disease resistance in crop plants.
Some pathogen elicitor orAvrgenes trigger a strong HR when expressed in transgenic plants; therefore, researchers investigated the possibility of using a pathogen-inducible promoter to drive an elicitor/Avrgene to activate BSR. Keller et al. (74) generated transgenic tobacco plants harboring a fusion between the pathogen-inducible tobaccohsr203Jgene promoter and aPhytophthora cryptogeagene encoding the elicitor cryptogein. AfterP. cryptogeainoculation, the induced production of cryptogein resulted in a localized HR that restricted further growth of the oomycetePhytophthoraand unrelated fungal pathogens (74). BSR was also obtained through the expression of bothRandAvrgenes in transgenic rice plants (61). These plants expressed theAvr1-CO39effector gene fromM. oryzae, under the control of an inducible promoter, and were challenged withXooandXocstrains carrying a TALE designed to transactivate the inducible promoter. The recognition of the corresponding NLR receptorPi-CO39by the inducedAvr1-CO39triggered resistance against the bacterial diseases (61). Such an approach, which is based on synthetic promoter traps, expands the panel of genes that can be exploited to engineer resistance in plants against infections by TALE-injecting pathogens. This strategy has not yet been tested in the control of crop diseases caused by pathogens that lack TALEs.
Engineering BSR is possible using bothdefense-signalingandPRgenesbecause they usually function downstream of the immune receptors. For example, silencing soybeanGmMPK4s caused spontaneous cell death in the leaves and stems and enhanced resistance against downy mildew and the soybean mosaic virus (105). Defense-signaling andPRgenes are conserved in different plant species, allowing BSR to be achieved in many crops by expressing theArabidopsisdefense master regulatorNPR1(116,119,164,165,188). TheNPR1orthologs cloned from other plants also function as BSR regulators in their native species and when expressed in other species; for example,NPR1cloned fromMalus pumila(MpNPR1) orMalus hupehensis(MhNPR1) can activate BSR in apple (Malus×domestica), protecting against fire blight, apple scab, and cedar apple rust (23,117,118). Similarly, the transgenic expression ofStoNPR1fromSolanum torvum(a wild eggplant highly resistant toVerticillium dahliae) in potato enhances its resistance againstV. dahliae(32).
SomePRgenes are involved in strengthening cell walls, generating an oxidative burst, and producing antimicrobial compounds in the host plants. The overexpression ofPRgenes, such as those encoding defensins, enhanced plant resistance to multiple pathogens (138,156). In another example, the expression ofCaAMP1, which encodes an antimicrobial protein, led to BSR against biotrophic, hemibiotrophic, and necrotrophic pathogens in pepper (89).
Transgenic plants with alterations in their expression of a single defense signaling orPRgene usually have relatively low levels of resistance against pathogens; however, stacking these transgenes may increase their resistance. If a strong HR occurs in the transgenic plants, an inducible expression system should be used to alleviate the cell death phenotypes. Another approach is to screen germplasm for new alleles with high expression levels but a minimal yield penalty.
Recent advances in genome editing technologies have enabled the targeted mutagenesis ofSgenesin several important crops, with the goal of generatingBSRagainst multiple pathogens. TALEN and CRISPR/Cas9 technologies were used to target theMloloci in wheat and thereby obtain plants resistant to powdery mildew (193). In tomato, knocking out theMloorthologSlMlo1using CRISPR/Cas9 resulted in plants fully resistant to the powdery mildew fungusOidium neolycopersici(130). Moreover, in rice, CRISPR/Cas9-induced mutations in the proline-rich motif ofPi21providedRNS BSRagainstM.oryzae(42,92), and promoter editing of threeSWEETgenes led to the development of BSR transgenic lines in all testedXoostrains in two mega rice varieties (136). Another example involves eIF4E, which is essential for the cellular infection cycle of potyviruses (155). Two independent studies recently showed that disruption ofeIF4Es using CRISPR/Cas9 led to resistance against ipomoviruses and potyviruses inArabidopsisand cucumber (20,145). These results clearly show that manipulation ofSgenes is a powerful approach for generating resistance in economically important crops.
A multiline cultivar is a mixture of pure lines that are agronomically similar but differ in a single trait, such as anRgene (125). Relative to single-component cultivars, multiline barley cultivars have up to 80% less disease, while wheat multilines show a 60% disease reduction (143). In rice, mixed plantings of disease-resistant and susceptible varieties grown in multiple locations for two years can greatly reduce the severity of rice blast infections in both varieties (222). Blast-resistant multilines composed of near-isogenic lines with differentRgeneshad lower levels of blast disease than their corresponding single-component cultivars (63,78,85). Generating uniform sets of near-isogenic lines in the same genetic background is time consuming; therefore, multilines composed of transgenic wheat lines overexpressingPm3a,Pm3c,Pm3d,Pm3f, orPm3gin the Bobwhite cultivar background were developed. Field tests showed that all transgenic lines were more resistant to powdery mildew than the respective control lines, with substantially greater resistance in the multilines containing all four pyramided alleles (15,79). This demonstrated that a difference in a singleRgene is sufficient to cause host-diversity effects, and that the development of multilines represents a promising strategy for the effective and sustainable use ofRalleles.Gene editingtechniques are rapidly being improved, meaning breeders will soon be able to engineer crop multilines containing both SNS- and RNS-BSR genes.
As discussed above and shown inFigure 1, significant progress has been made in the identification of BSR genes and in our understanding of the molecular basis of BSR. In addition, several breeding strategies have been employed to select BSR cultivars (Figure 2). However, many challenges remain regarding the application of BSR in crop breeding. These challenges and their possible solutions are discussed in the following sections.

The molecular mechanisms underlying the trade-off between resistance and crop yield are largely unknown (134); however, several recent studies have described new approaches for minimizing the fitness cost of disease tolerance in rice. ThePigmlocus in rice encodes a pair of antagonistic NLR receptors, PigmR and PigmS (31), which decrease and enhance yields, respectively. The transfer of both receptors into a susceptible line ensures a good balance between yield and immunity, and the entirePigmlocus has been introduced into elite cultivars using traditional breeding. Another study demonstrates that the substitution of a single nucleotide in the promoter of theBsr-d1gene enhances disease resistance without reducing yields (94). Two recent studies showed that the TF-encoding geneIdeal Plant Architecture1(IPA1) promotes high yields while contributing to rice immunity againstM. oryzaeandXoo(106,190). The use of genetic and genomic approaches to identify additionalPigm-,Bsr-d1-, andIPA1-like alleles in rice and other crops will provide new germplasm materials for the breeding of new cultivars with both high pathogen resistance and high yields.
The overexpression of immune receptor–encoding, defense signaling,PR, andNHRgenes often leads to cell death and dwarf phenotypes (134). Upstream open reading frames (uORFs), located in the 5′ untranslated regions, are potentcis-acting regulators of translation and mRNA turnover and are abundant in angiosperm genomes (187). InArabidopsis, the TF TL1-binding factor 1 (TBF1) is involved in the switch from growth to defense that occurs upon induction of the immune response. The TBF1 cassette consists of theTBF1promoter and the 5′ untranslated region, which contains two pathogen-inducible uORFs. A recent study used uORFsTBF1-mediated translational control to minimize the fitness cost of BSR inArabidopsisand rice (199). The authors found that theTBF1p:uORFs-NPR1andTBF1p:uORFs-SNC1transgenic plants displayed BSR against three rice pathogens without suffering any fitness cost. This strategy provides a way of minimizing the negative effects of the overexpression of BSR genes in crops. The search for additional TBF1-like TFs in plant genomes may lead to the development of crop plants with BSR but without the associated reductions in growth and yield.
The widespread and long-term planting of BSR cultivars will likely increase the selection pressure on pathogens and increase the appearance of resistance-breaking populations (121). In theory, BSR cultivars should providedurable resistancebecause overcoming their resistance mechanisms would require the accumulation of mutations in multiple pathogen effectors. The durability of BSR cultivars mainly depends on the evolutionary potential of the pathogens, however, which can be considerable for species with complex populations, mixed reproductive systems, and substantial gene flow (121). Researchers have proposed that multivirulent pathogen populations develop in a step-by-step manner (14); therefore, a complete survey of the frequency of virulent strains in the field is essential for the correct deployment of BSR genes or combinations ofRgenes andQTLsin crop production. In addition, the establishment of natural disease nurseries used for the evaluation of the resistance capabilities of different BSR cultivars will also be helpful for testing the effectiveness of the BSR genes.
Although the molecular mechanism underlying NHR in plant defense is still not clear, the use of NHR in crops is a promising approach for breeding BRS cultivars. The wheatLr34gene is a good example because the transfer of this gene to other cereal species, such as barley, rice, and maize, confers resistance against multiple species-specific pathogens of these crops (11,83,175). Another promisingNHRgene is theCajanus cajan Resistance against Phakopsora pachyrhizi 1(CcRpp1), anNLR-encoding gene from pigeonpea (C. cajan) that confers resistance against the fungal pathogenP. pachyrhiziin soybean (73). Nevertheless, the number ofLr34- andCcRpp1-like genes in crops is limited, and new methods for rapidly isolating such genes are required. Although the expression ofNHRgenes across phylogenetically distant species may lead to the development ofBSRin economically important crops, some crop plants currently remain untransformable, which limits the application of theNHRgenes. The development of new transformation techniques in these crops will facilitate the use ofNHRgenes for the engineering of additional BSR crops.
Crop breeders have introgressedRgenes from wild relatives into elite cultivars (9,60). The maizeRgeneHtn1, encoding a putativeWAKthat confers quantitative resistance against most isolates of northern corn leaf blight, was introduced from a Mexican landrace into modern maize breeding lines in the 1970s (60). In apple, the susceptible cultivar Gala showed enhanced scab resistance against multiple strains ofVenturia inaequalisafter being transformed with theRgeneHcrVf2from the wild speciesMalus floribunda(9). One challenge for transferring newRgenes from wild relatives into cultivated lines is how to rapidly identify and clone theRalleles that confer BSR. Recently, multiple strategies have been used to clone newRgenes from the wild relatives of wheat, barley, and potato, including MutRenSeq, MutChromSeq, dRenSeq, and RenSeq (22,154,172). These low-cost mapping strategies can be adapted for use with other crop plants.
The interspecies transfer ofPRRgenes was recently reported; for example, theArabidopsis EFRgene was introduced into tomato (86), rice (112,161), potato (12),Medicago(141) and wheat (159), and the resulting transgenic plants displayed resistance to the pathogens adapted to each of these crops. Similarly, the transformation ofXa21into tomato (1), sweet orange (Citrus aurantium) (123), and banana (Musa acuminata) (183) increased resistance toXanthomonas axonopodispv.citri,R. solanacearum, andX. campestrispv.musacearum, respectively.Although PRRs have been transferred between species, the resistance levels of the transgenic lines, such as theArabidopsis EFRgene in rice, to their species-specific pathogens have usually been relatively low (161); however, combining PRR genes with NLRs or QTLs in the recipient species could enhance the resistance levels and spectra of the transgenic plants.
Previous research suggests that, in a pyramid, oneRgene may mask the effects of the others, such that someRgene combinations provide less disease resistance than other combinations (127). For example, rice plants containing bothPiz-5andPitahad lower blast resistance than plants containingPiz-5alone (55). Similar results were reported in the pyramided lines containingPizandPi54(196). In addition, the genetic background of the recipient cultivars may affect the resistance phenotype; the resistance conferred by a combination ofXa5,Xa13, andXa21differed substantially among five rice cultivars, indicating the possible presence of resistance suppressors in some of the host plants (144). The effects of specific combinations of different BSR genes or pyramids ofRgenes and QTLs are therefore not predictable and should be tested in different genetic backgrounds before being used in crop breeding programs. Further investigation of the mechanisms underlying the synergistic or antagonistic effects of different BSR gene combinations or genetic backgrounds will provide essential new information for BSR breeding.
Biotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens use different strategies: Necrotrophic pathogens kill host tissues because they colonize and thrive on the contents of dead or dying cells, whereas biotrophs depend on living host cells to complete their life cycle (48). In many cases, plants with resistance against biotrophic pathogens are susceptible to necrotrophic pathogens, and vice versa (179); however, transgenic carrots (Daucus carota) expressingNPR1had BSR against both necrotrophic and biotrophic pathogens (188). The two transgenic carrot lines in that study exhibited a 35–50% reduction in disease symptoms on their foliage and roots when exposed to three necrotrophic pathogens and an 80–90% reduction in disease development in response to two biotrophic pathogens. It is therefore critical for breeders to identify new BSR genes that confer resistance against both necrotrophic and biotrophic pathogens in crops.
